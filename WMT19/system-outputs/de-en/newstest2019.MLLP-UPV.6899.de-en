Yes, she wants...
Become a "beautiful miner" in 2018!
In the afternoon, another surprise awaits our candidates: They will not be doing the romantic candlelight shoot in front of MY SOLARIS alone, but at the side of male model Fabian!
Hvar - flirting, coquetting, seducing - no easy tasks for our girls.
Especially if a friend is waiting in Germany.
Nevertheless, the nine "Beautiful Mint" candidates deliver during the shoot with People photographer Tuan, defying the wind, spray and rain like real professionals.
The romantic shoot can be found in the video:
DFB chief Grindel sees no basis for Özil comeback
Berlin DFB president Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for Mesut Özil to return to the national team.
"This is a question that depends, of course, on the fact that you get into the conversation, that you also talk to him about why he apparently felt one or the other in the way that is laid down in his statement," Grindel said in the football podcast "Phrasenmoher" of the "Bild" newspaper.
Despite months of debate over Özil's photos with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of 92-time national player Özil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut Özil had continued playing for Germany.
I also assumed up to a certain point that this would be the case, "Grindel said.
The 29-year-old declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and justified it by saying that Grindel had not defended him against racist hostility during the World Cup.
The head of the DFB reiterated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with German coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He did not want to create any pressure, but he knows from football that "when you leave a team or change a club, you talk to your coach about it and I think it's a pity that this conversation hasn't come about so far."
Linz: Garden hut burnt in Schrebergartensiedlung
At 2.13 p.m., the Linz Fire Department was alerted to a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly over the nursery community, danger was in arrears.
The fire brigade got out and found the hut in full fire when they arrived.
The roof had to be practically completely removed and fire debris had to be cleared to the extent that was absolutely necessary.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had plugged a battery into the store at lunchtime.
This could possibly be the cause of the fire.
In any case, according to the fire brigade, the charger was in the area of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire has yet to be determined, as has the cause of the fire.
However, it is likely to be considerable, as the owner had many collectors' items in his garden hut.
Angry mother defends herself: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on open road
What drove Lindsay Lohan to this very strange action?
She apparently wanted to snatch the children from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has live streamed herself apparently trying to snatch the children from a family in Moscow.
The US portal "TMZ" reports this and publishes a partial recording of the stream.
See "Happily Kissed" with Lindsay Lohan
In the clip, Lohan can be seen getting out of a car and heading to a possibly homeless family she wants to identify as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family flees from the actress, Lohan chases the parents and their children.
It accuses the adults of trafficking children.
It does not provide any evidence for all of this in the clip.
"The whole world just sees it," Lohan can be heard in the video as she continues to follow the family along the street.
Apparently she is trying to separate the children from their parents.
At some point, however, it seems to be enough for the obviously angry mother.
It looks like she turns around and Lohan misses a slap in the face.
In tears, the actress then asserts how shocked she is - and she holds her cheek.
It is currently unclear what prompted Lohan to take this action.
Landing on Ryugu: This is the mission of "Mascot" on the asteroid
The "Hayabusa2" probe was launched in Japan in December 2014.
It should approach the asteroid Ryugu so much that it can absorb material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The "Mascot" lander will remain on Ryugu.
Foreign ticker: Number of deaths in Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of magnitude 7.5 and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, there is talk of at least 420 deaths.
The number of casualties could increase even further.
Rescue crews have not yet entered the devastated areas cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla CEO
In the beginning there was a tweet.
Tesla boss Elon Musk caused a stir on the stock markets in early August when he announced a withdrawal of the electric car maker.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued him for fraud, but now they have reached an agreement.
Tesla and Musk will have to pay, and the Tesla boss will withdraw from the supervisory board, but he will be allowed to remain chairman.
British Conservative Party Congress
Closely guarded - the Tories' party congress
Birmingham is becoming the stage for a power struggle.
The party congress is supposed to be about foreign policy, trade and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the row between Prime Minister Theresa May and Brexit hardliners, at the forefront of which is ex-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.
Referendum for a new name
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a Balkan state, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about these couplings for years.
Now they have agreed.
In the future, the State of Macedonia will be called Northern Macedonia and the population will vote on this this Sunday - will it do well?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populist Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The not") - meaning Jair Bolsonaro.
One week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands took to the streets in several cities to protest right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" has emerged as an anti-system candidate and is thus ahead in the polls.
His sharpest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Workers Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" reworking takes longer than planned
"The diesel task force is still in place," chief development officer Peter Mertens told industry magazine "Automobilwoche."
In December 2017, the Audi boss Rupert Stadler, who has been detained and approved, announced that the task force would soon be dissolved.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all engine / gearbox combinations are likely to be tested," he said at the time.
Mertens said: "At the beginning of July, we reached an important milestone in dealing with the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The task force was set up in September 2015 following the discovery of the diesel scandal at Audi's parent company Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the carmaker had made "serious organisational changes" so that such a scandal would never happen again.
The VW supervisory board had postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and plans to discuss it further this Tuesday.
The investigation authorities accuse the Audi boss of having allowed the sale of diesel cars with false emissions levels after the emissions cheating became public.
He knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
Bram Schot, the company's sales director, currently heads the board of directors.
Due to the switch to the new emission and consumption testing standard WLTP, there were production losses at Audi, said Schot, the "Heilbronn voice."
In principle, he sees a decrease in demand for sedans such as the A6, A7 and A8 audio models, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Schot relies on electromobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, 15,000 reservations have already been made.
Grindel seeks re-election - Lahm to join DFB
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel wants to run for office as DFB president again next year, despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup exit and the Özil affair.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as I can," Grindel said as a guest on ZDF's "Current Sports Studio" early on Sunday morning.
You have to keep trying for re-election, I will do that.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
According to his own words, the head of the association would find it "strange" if he did not "feel like working on the future project" after winning the European Football Championship in 2024.
Grindel has been head of the association since April 2016 as successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who was ousted over the summer fairy tale affair.
In autumn 2016, he was elected for a first full three-year term.
The next vote will take place in the DFB Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future chief organiser of the European Championship, Philipp Lahm, is to work in the DFB-Praesidium.
"I would be happy if my colleagues in the Bureau would agree that he would continue to advise in this role in the future and would then of course be cordially invited to make his experience available when it comes to sporting matters," Grindel said.
He did not wish to participate in speculation as to whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB head.
As a consequence of the affair over the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in future a national player without a migration background should become an integration ambassador for the DFB.
Cacau and Celia Sasic, who have family roots in Cameroon, are currently holding this office.
"If someone has a clear impact on society and football without a migration background and says," the issue is important, we have to take care of it, "it would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground, where integration must work," said Grindel.
Taking off properly with semi-clever scales
I have had a new toy for four weeks.
A scale that measures not only my weight, but also my body fat percentage.
It can also indicate muscle and bone mass.
The thing also calculates the body mass index, but this is more for the cups.
He doesn't say anything about whether I've replaced fat with muscle.
Basketball Bundesliga: Clear opening successes for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin has started the new season in the basketball Bundesliga with a significant victory.
Against Science City Jena, the runner-up easily won with 112: 55 (52: 31) and offered a convincing match for more than 40 minutes.
New recruit Rokas Giedraitis was top scorer of the dominant Berlin team with 20 points.
The national player Johannes Thiemann (18 points), who is committed from Ludwigsburg, also showed an attractive performance in front of 9113 spectators in his debut match.
Ex-champion Brose Bamberg won 84: 80 (39: 37) on the debut of trainer Ainars Bagatskis at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine rubit was the best scorer among the guests with 24 points.
Würzburg professional Gabriel Olaseni scored 14 points.
Last year's playoff semi-finalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg beat the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt by 83: 76 (41: 34).
New national player Karim Jallow was the most accurate shooter in coach John Patrick's team with 24 points.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a clear success.
With the basketball Lions in Braunschweig, there was a clear 100: 64 (48: 30) and the first two points.
New playmaker Will Cummings topped the Oldenburg with 25 points.
Braunschweig, where NBA star Dennis Schroeder has been the majority owner since the start of the season, was disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26: 1 run by the Baskets quickly made things clear.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, among others, during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to extradite supporters of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm German-Turkish friendship, "he said.
The Cologne city centre was partially blocked for the opening of the Ditib mosque.
Several thousand policemen were on duty - including snipers.
The Ditib Islamic Association has come under criticism for being an extension of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music Against Poverty: Stars, cries and scares
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have called for more engagement in the fight against poverty and disease at a joint concert in New York's Central Park.
"Get involved wherever you can," Mendes told around 60,0000 spectators at the festival on the night of Sunday.
Thank you for coming here, it's a dream.
Cardi B stepped out in a red outfit with fringes and a golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organisations, also showed up on stage at the multi-hour event.
In between, however, there was a second of terror, when many spectators thought the sound of a falling metal barrier was gunshots, got scared and tried to flee.
Panic briefly ensued, people were running into each other.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said organiser Hugh Evans.
However, the New York Police Department and musician Chris Martin then calmed people down from the stage.
"Nobody is trying to hurt anybody," Martin said.
You are all safe.
Like every year, tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available for free on the Internet.
Anyone who wanted to win one had to read and spread texts, photos and videos on the Internet about the global fight against poverty and diseases.
There were cheers and applause from the audience for the numerous musicians and actors - while boos for the Republican senator Jeff Flake.
The latter, together with his Democratic colleague Chris Coons, spoke out on stage in favour of greater equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had expressed support for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court judge in the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, upsetting many women.
At least three women have made allegations of abuse up to the attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which he denies.
Flake called for an FBI investigation into the allegations after two women who said they themselves experienced sexual assault confronted him in an elevator on the way to the committee meeting.
"You can also come with me in an elevator anytime," Flake said to the audience at the concert in New York.
Freedom of the press: German government defends ejection of journalist
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert has defended the ousting of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the chancellery, the Turkish journalist, who lives in Hamburg, had pulled over a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for journalists" and walked into the front row.
The T-shirt was not the problem, Seibert told Bild am Sonntag.
It was a disturbance of the course of the press conference.
The action of the journalist has caused great unrest, which is unacceptable.
For this reason, he has ordered that human rights defenders take the man out.
Seibert said that it was not permitted to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This applies regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, numerous journalists are in prison.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage or support or membership in banned parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership blames the movement for the failed coup attempt on 15 July 2016.
Some of the accused journalists face several decades in prison.
Foreign journalists are not safe from the Turkish authorities either: The Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested at the beginning of September.
Most recently, the cases of the imprisoned journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel caused a stir.
They were released and were able to return to Germany, but trials against the two are still underway in Turkey.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him so fresh and good-looking: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look twice: Yes, that really is Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and had a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht," produced by NDR, is known for humid, cheerful conversations at the counter of Hamburg's "Schhagfischer Posten" port pub.
Presenter Ina Müller and her guests come across a lot of beer, some wine or even more high-quality drinks to lighten the mood and tongues.
Quite a few celebrities are also braving the mandatory singing intakes.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time around: The actor Florian David Fitz is known from films such as "Men's Hearts," "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Funniest Day."
But the trip to the far north did not benefit the Munich-based company at all.
On Saturday, he posted a selfie - his face is completely shattered, his eyes only two small slits.
The bed selfie shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he just has a mighty hangover.
Addressing his fans, he posted some - probably not entirely serious - insights that he has now gained: "Rule One: Do NOT go to Ina's night.
Rule two: Never drink the black sow.
And spritz.
And the round of egg liqueur, which Ina peels by half three, also leaves.
The 43-year-old really has the alcohol on his face.
His fans immediately posted a few tips to combat the aftershocks.
They ranged from instant broth, fish rolls or - probably the most effective - headache tablets.
Others simply amused at the sight of the normally attractive star of the cinema.
How Ina Müller survived the night raid is not yet known.
Since she has been moderating the TV fun at the bar since 2007, however, the 53-year-old seems to be much more seasoned...
A beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa is struggling with vandalism and rubbish
The entrance to the 36-kilometre-long railway cycle path in the Red Riding Hood region in Treysa is difficult to find and littered.
Recipes against rampant vandalism are being sought, but solutions are scarcely emerging.
Shards, cigarette butts, rubbish and rubbish, demolished rubbish bins and now dismantled signs - this is how the entrance to the bike path on the Haaße Hill in Treysa has been presented for some time.
For the showpiece object, the railway cycle path in Rotkäppchenland is more than an unruly sight.
The topic has also been occupied by members of the local ADFC group Schwalmstadt and others for some time, according to Ulrich Wüstenhagen, the city's cycling commissioner.
The problem has already been addressed in the Cycling Advisory Council.
So far, there is no solution.
The proposals ranged from the installation of the seating group to the regular emptying of the waste bins and the cleaning of the areas at the entrance.
"I think the latter would be the order of the day - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that he has also brought the issue to the local advisory council.
It is not just the rubbish that drives cyclists and residents around - the seating group is a regular meeting place for celebrations at weekends.
Not only does it often get loud, but it also destroys the railings: Knocks poles out of the ground, demolishes rubbish bins, knocks over signs, smears seating furniture.
Volunteers have already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
The actions, however, are only the proverbial drop in the ocean.
They are angry that the rest area on the bike path in Treysa is a meeting place for refreshments.
"Along the entire cycle path, the focus here is clearly on the Haaße Hill," confirms the cycling commissioner, who is now also concerned about the new cycling facility in Ziegenhain, which will open today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be really expensive."
Another idea is video surveillance on the hillside: "This may set the threshold much higher for trespassing on public property.
This would presuppose, however, that a police crackdown would then pass in due course.
In principle, Wüstenhagen wants the Haaße Hill to develop.
It must be made more attractive.
You can be very satisfied with the frequency of the cycle so far.
The tourism marketing is still expandable.
Our bike path is very high quality compared to others in Germany, "says the ADFC members.
As an extremely critical danger site, ADFC member Susanne Klippert estimates the situation on Ascheröder Strasse in Treysa.
There is no turning lane on the Haaße hill.
With heavy traffic, it can happen that cyclists have to wait in the middle of the road between the two sides of the traffic, "she explains.
This is not a problem for sporty drivers, but for the elderly and especially for children.
Music Contest at the Culture Station: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and in togetherness.
"D a song for Hiltrup," is the appeal of the Hiltrup district offensive, in the "Music contest for big and small, young and experienced musicians."
A contest "with a wink in the sympathetic Hiltruper family," as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family meeting for coffee and cake by the volunteers of the Culture Station.
There were seven groups, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, an Albany long living in Hiltrup, the Nine of the "Hiltruper Star Colors," three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the Lummerland Kindergarten and finally the Rider Zwarties and ZWeßling.
This contest, declared district mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We have not yet seen that in other parts of the city.
What did the copywriters see as connected?
The towns of Hiltruper See and Marktallee were particularly frequently mentioned.
Rolf Ihmig named the avenue "Kö von Hiltrup" in his hit-like song.
The cultural station was also honoured.
Time and again, it was a matter of experiencing togetherness in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short breaks with short interviews with the performers or hints about their work.
So it was learned from Humberg that he had actually studied chemistry, but was now also teaching guitar.
From the sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann, Franke knew that he had recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest in the programme.
And Alvin Jasic has put a lot of things on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a present from Hiltrup gastronomy.
Nevertheless, there was something special for the jury's favourites - so that others could also listen to their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel untied can record an entire CD with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup hit, which particularly impressed Franke with its musicality, and the "Lummerland pack": "A very beautiful performance" with ten children and two teachers on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone else, the children made another appearance at the finals - and even sounded "really good" without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, catchiness of the melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß from the KVG Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the business association as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive launched the event on the occasion of its tenth anniversary.
She regarded the event as a complete success.
Everyone was "very satisfied" and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon-to-be full cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other.
For each side there is a screen, in which there are four cards with keywords, which you can only decipher - the old trick with the red foil - once you have put them in.
This ensures that the other side cannot read anything by mistake.
On the cards, for example, you can read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2 window.
3. Dice.
4th feast. "
These are the terms that will henceforth have to be coded.
After all, it is not the concepts that should be guessed, but codes.
Alternately one player per team is the encoder.
He gets a code card that says "3.4.2."
In "Decrypto," it is not the terms behind the secret slide that are to be guessed, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case is to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "cube," "feast" and "window" in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team does not, if possible, win the game if he manages to crack the code twice.
The encoder thus notes and reads aloud: "Throw" for the dice, "lots" as a contrast to the party; here, of course, something like "party" and "Prague" would be possible, because he paid attention at school and knows the crash of the windows there.
So it goes on round by round, team by team.
You may not know the terms of the other side, but you can better rhyme with any hint that the encoder gives there.
The transcriptions should be as mysterious as possible, but not too twisted, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptic thing about "decrypto" is the rule book.
The players will probably have to study it quite long and in detail until they can finally play.
The explanatory video at decrypto.info on the net makes it easier.
But once you get started, you will be fascinated by how much feeling there is in this inconspicuous game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as coherent as its predecessor and genre prime "Codenames," which also puts an agency theme on a game with fewer words, but is much better played in small groups.
And if you are concerned only with rates and not with points of victory, you can easily invent a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler greeting and harassing guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man was double-employed by Kulmbach Police Inspectorate during the night from Saturday to Sunday.
First he showed Hitler's greeting in the Upper City during a police patrol passing by, then later he also fell in a pub in the Upper City when he harassed other guests.
After he was clearly alcoholic and did not comply with the police summons, he had to spend the night in the detention centre with the Kulmbach Police Inspectorate.
In a sober state, he must also be held criminally responsible for the use of license plates of unconstitutional organizations.
The Pressig factory was home to the Schubloks
For decades, the railway plant in Pressig was the hub in the Franconian Forest.
In 1991, a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers hit buffers, you could hear it in full prescience," recalls Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
It excited no one.
Then the brakes also quieted and the wagons gnawed.
It was pure rail.
Statements that symbolise Dinkel's homeland, Pressig.
Nowhere in the Franconian Forest has a place been so shaped by the railways.
Here was the starting point of the Steilrampen mountain range to the north, which, after an increase of about 220 metres in height, has its apex in Steinbach am Wald.
In order to cope with this, earlier trains and pushers were needed, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian parliament approved the construction of a railway factory with 21 locomotive shed, apprentice workshop, driving management and railway mastery.
"The centrepiece was the turntable, which had a diameter of 18 metres after a reconstruction in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and 47-year-old professional railway worker.
Locomotives for the Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalfen branch lines were also operated by the railway plant (BW) Pressig, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968.
On 15 July 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steam engines and eight Elloks were stationed in Pressig at the time.
The electrification of the line in 1939 already minimised the need for train and pushers.
From 1977, they were only used for freight trains.
Up to 1991, there were at least 10 000 weighs in the month.
In 1982 parts of the factory were broken off, in 1991 the rest.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that we have not considered a better use of the site, also in terms of freight transport."
On Pentecost 1989, the Nuremberg railway directorate celebrated a pompous station party in Pressig on the anniversary of "50 years of electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld."
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," recalls Georg Dinkel.
A little later, the end.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were removed, and the shunting station was history.
"The rangers and inhibitors did the most difficult work on the train," recalls Dinkel.
Any wrongdoing would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station Pressig-Rothenkirchen has led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many more historical and current pictures are available here in the InfrankenPlus article.
Kerber to kick off success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winners Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round at the tennis tournament in Beijing, as Julia Görges did before.
Kerber won 6: 2, 6: 2 against Frenchwoman Kristina Mladenovic at the China Open.
The next opponent in the world rankings is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakh or the Spaniard Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6: 3, 4: 2 against Darja Kassatkina when the Russian, ranked number 13, gave up.
The Swabian now has to deal with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
A special exhibition in Mittelehrenbach was opened at the weekend as part of the "Art and Enjoy" series.
With great relief, organisers and visitors registered the ideal weather when the special "Windspiel-Performance" opening ceremony was opened in the open-air area of the Dahlmann-Schmidt estate, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the umbrella of the tourism association "Rund um Walberla" within the framework of the series "Art and Enjoy."
It opened its doors in the 15th year.
The fascination of the exhibition was demonstrated by a large number of visitors.
21 specimens by 20 artists can now be visited in Mittelehrenbach.
Host Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the vernissage.
He himself has been there since the very first hour.
Just like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist.
Somewhat surprisingly, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he put his task into proven, young hands with good prospects for the future.
Both have played an active role in the selection of artists in the past and have contributed flyers.
Once again this year, on the occasion of art and enjoyment, there will be a special 70 cent stamp designed by them, available at every art station.
This year's poster "Betzn austanzen," designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased there for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased with the high level of support for the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg could be won for the musical framing.
Walking through the spacious garden, it quickly becomes clear to the visitor that the title "Windspiel Performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it in a playful manner.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramics, often with colour accents.
Already at the entrance of the estate, the "Glücksbaum" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau, is waiting for the visitor on the right.
It is a tree stump, brightened in colour, playfully provided with 20 windmills, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminum tubes as a piece of sound.
With the sun flashing through the bushes in the background, the object looks like a fairy tale and invites you to linger.
From Eckental comes Barbara Waschneck, who prefers to dedicate 15 years of K & G to the event in three-dimensional letters.
There are many parts, in the wind, in motion.
Half way through, Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "The Wind: The Heavenly Child."
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colorful fantasy structure of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Windspiel Performance" for strolling through the multifaceted art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited until 31 December 2018.
50th anniversary of MGV 68 Albany: Singers celebrate 50th birthday
1968 - that was the time of protest and the student movement.
And the Albanians also expressed their displeasure at the time.
At least five of them.
They did not want to accept the fact that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should be no more sangesleben in the district.
It has now become a legend: At a bank in Tinnbusch, they launched the MGV 68 Albany.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary has been celebrated in a big way in the "House of Meeting."
"It will be full today," guessed Chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he should be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albany singers.
Specifically for the anniversary, they had revived the foundation festival.
For years it was a tradition, then there was a break.
On time for the 50th anniversary, the traditional festival was back.
It was an elegant ball, festive clothes had been asked for before.
The guests did not sit in rows of seats as usual in the "House of Meeting," but sat comfortably at tables.
In between, movement was required: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln pulled on the controllers and asked for them on the dance floor.
It is a matter of honour that the singers from MGV 68 Albany themselves made their voices heard.
Suitable for the occasion, cheerful songs were announced.
Almost set: "Such a day, as beautiful as today."
In keeping with the exquisite grape juice that many had before them, there was the "Rüdesheim wine."
Alluding to another cool drink was "Humulus lupulus," which is the Latin term for "hops."
Once again, the choir was dominated by Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were in Tinnbush at the time.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," Holstiege said, "He's such an easy guy, it's a masterstroke he does." By the way, this time it wasn't just men singing.
The women's choir "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire includes mainly evergreens from the 20s to the 60s.
Finally, there was poetry.
Singer Theo Weber sat at his desk until three in the morning to create his own rhymes.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented fine-sounding poetry.
There was also a large tombola.
The proceeds will be used to fund a visit to the all-weather zoo for the children of the Albatros Youth Centre.

Volleyball: 3rd Women's League: USC II wins top-class derby against BW Aasee
The ascendant marches.
Three games, three wins - USC Münster's reserve, under the patronage of Axel Büring, is well placed in League Three.
No trace of shyness or fracking, the independents do their thing.
And that's really good at 3: 0 (25: 15, 25: 23, 26: 24) against city rival BW Aasee.
"It was not crystal clear, but we have already left an impression," says the reasonably satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed: "This is a defeat that we can live with very well.
We are not dissatisfied. "On the contrary.
In the evening, at a later birthday party of Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game was ticked off.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical illusion.
In the third set, the guests had a set ball.
"If they make it to the finish line, such a game can be overturned," Büring knows from years of experience.
Finally, USC, with its well-routed forces, made everything clear and brought the full yield to the finish line.
"We are all aware of who is on the other side in such a derby.
This does not break our nerves.
I've seen really good volleyball in phases, "Annacker did not bother with the 0: 3 - and promptly moved on to the agenda.
Where the journey goes for the independents does not seem to be foreseeable after just three days of play.
"It's just too early for that," says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The 3rd league has an unbelievably good level.
This is not nearly comparable with regional league volleyball. "In the fourth league, anyway, they no longer want to turn their eyes downwards.
If the vest is not soiled in the next few weeks, they will have to look up.
However, a first balance can only be drawn after ten or eleven games.
On Saturday we will go to Emlichheim.
Aasee will be in Essen on 14 October.

Glider crashes - student fatally injured
The pilot died in the crash of a glider in Essen.
The single-seat plane crashed on Sunday afternoon upon landing in a parking lot not far from Essen-Mülheim Airport, a police spokesman said on Sunday in Essen.
The parking lot next to Highway 52, which is normally used for shuttle traffic to the fair, was largely empty, while other people were not injured in the crash.
Emergency responders continued to look after flight students and eyewitnesses on the ground.
In the immediate vicinity was the venue of an Oktoberfest, where numerous guests were expected in the evening.
The cause of the crash was initially unclear - the weather was good, there was light wind and sunshine.
Essen-Mülheim is a small airport, which is much used by pilots with light private planes.
On her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "dream ship," Heide Keller became a star.
Now she speaks openly about the fact that the series may have been complicit in her marriage break-up with Hans von Borsody.
Her role as the head hostess Beatrice of Ledebur on the "dream ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1st, 2018, she went on board forever.
The series that made her a star could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
"That may also have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, travelled around the world alone with a suitcase, and many colleagues I admired saw me at eye level, "says Keller in an interview with Bild am Sonntag.
At first she was only "the wife of Hans von Borsody," but that changed with the "dream ship."
Because now the journalists only called at Heide Keller.
"I don't know if he liked it that much."
She thinks it is possible that her then husband may have been envious, but "like many men, Hans was afraid of talking about problems and feelings."
Keller had always tried to be "the only right thing for Hans von Borsody" and he did not want to get to know my fears, my weaknesses.
This means in good German: I have changed my mind, "she explains.
She had always felt "not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman who, in truth, I never was, even though I sometimes appeared cheeky and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever. "
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes again, "although I was afraid that it might go wrong a second time."
The day before the civil ceremony, I sat in the cloakroom howling and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to Borsody also failed.
Why it never worked out with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
At the time, Keller had imagined love "like in the film."
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday life.
I approached love far too naively. "
The night owl, who regularly explores the city's nightlife in the Zurich NZZ resort, has this time dared to attend the ZFF opening party.
Our butterfly is not a moth, but a little light shy.
And the bright glow into which a green carpet has been plunged on the Sechseläutenplatz is blinding him for a fee.
But it's just a film festival, where more or less famous people want to sunbathe in the spotlight.
So on this late Thursday evening, he tore across the square in order to make things easier in the "Aquaclean toilet oasis."
This is the name of the public toilet system sponsored by a large plumbing company, which is celebrating its premiere at the festival: The needy institution in the parterre of a new pavilion is making a lot of effort to radiate a luxurious ambience.
This evening, however, things stink to the heavens in the gentlemen's oasis for some reason.
So get out of here, over to the other side of the street: Invited guests, who have just been entertained at the best level in the cinema next door by the opening film "Green Book," celebrate the start of the festival with a party in the three-storey department store, just like every year.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: All over the world, as you know, the works on show are from the globe.
What not to think about an article about this festival in order not to fall into creepy advertising for its 190 partner companies.
The keeper ties a ribbon around the feelers, which has put a good fairy on it, and two bullish doormen actually wave it generously in.
Inside, the invited crowd, they dance to live music well after midnight, or let themselves be pretended by DJ rhythms, to which they shout at each other, and flush down with cüpli exquisite poppies.
In the delicatessen in the basement, oysters are waiting for mouth-watering, next door, the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut open, a chocolate fountain bubbles.
And the hammer is off: All the shelves full of exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to be working without major losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The filler studies the sign on the escalator: "Wear a long dress, please be careful on the escalator."
If these are two separate instructions, he has lost himself in the dress code.
But it is more of a conditional construction, and it has certainly saved lives.
In the housewares department upstairs, the poultry is tipping a cocktail made with espresso called "Golden Eye," in line with the festival award.
This mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself, does not necessarily receive the prize for the best drink.
And George Clooney, who has been promoting the brand for years, is not here that evening either.
But then, between the local celebrity, the cash desk and the kitchen items, there is a face that is familiar to the observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His main protagonist is unlikely to be far away.
And really: Viggo Mortensen, soon to be sixty and almost like a choir boy, walks through the crowd.
He is not being tortured, he is not being begged, at most he is being steeled.
International stars love this festival precisely for its reticence, which is often misunderstood as clumsiness.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with cumbia dances
Coach and ex-football star Diego Maradona is delighted with his team's victory.
Argentina football legend Diego Maradona appears to have settled in well in his new home country of Mexico.
After a 2-0 victory by his Dorados de Sinaloa club, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the cab to Cumbia-Rythmen, as shown in a video released on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in the yellow jersey, cheered on by the players.
The Mexican second-division side beat the Leones Negros by 2: 0 on Saturday.
After the match, Maradona shouted into a TV camera, "Always with my boys, always."
The 57-year-old has been training the Mexican club since the beginning of September.
Handball: Verbandsliga 1: ASV Send after last-minute bust "destroyed on the ground"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball association ASV Senden, could hardly believe it: "Such a bitter defeat." His defenders were "destroyed on the ground" after the unfortunate 29: 30 (12: 14) - bust - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday night at LIT Germania 2.
As in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst, they had not played badly over long periods, the Sendens said.
Only the initial phase "did we fall asleep completely," the ASV coach was annoyed.
The hosts quickly led with 8: 1, and even the early break that Bieletzki had taken did not bear fruit at first.
"But then suddenly a ruck went through the team," Bieletzki summed up the second quarter of an hour.
At the break, the gap was only two goals.
Above all, Senden's best friend, Marius Hintze, hit the stage again and again.
From a visitor's point of view, things got even better after the change.
After 33 minutes David Ernst equalised at 15: 15, then the relay changer almost led throughout.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still a reassuring three (29: 26).
And then?
The impartial intervened.
Bieletzki is usually wary of seeking guilt in others.
But: The 120-second time penalty that Steffen Mühlhoff copped was "a joke."
Lit had a good laugh and hit four more times until the end - while the depleted ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, stood well in the back against seven men and kept throwing at the empty goal.
But they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now it must be a damn victory," said Bieletzki, who served completely.
ASV goals: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hüging (1).
Bavaria: Woman missing for 30 years - police dig for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of a then 18-year-old from Naila (district of Hof), police are searching for the woman's remains.
Emergency personnel dug up a road near Marxgrün on Saturday.
For this purpose, the road surface and several layers underneath it were removed, according to police and prosecutors.
According to new information, the missing person may not have been buried far from where they lived at the time.
The woman has been missing since 4 November 1986.
At the time, the investigators did not rule out a crime.
Since last year, the criminal police Hof, together with the prosecutor's office, has been working intensively on the case once again, according to the information.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian monument protection authority, the investigators found a conspicuousness under the street near Marxgrün by means of a ground radars.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officers confined the site to a few metres.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows the dangers that lurk on the net.
However, users can also provide additional security themselves.
Instead of complicated sequences of letters, users should use passphrases to secure their accounts on the net.
In addition, security updates, such as for Windows, should be installed quickly, and there is no harm in equipping computers with anti-virus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of electric car maker Tesla, has escaped his imminent dismissal as chief executive of the multibillion-dollar company.
He and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) settled out of court a dispute over misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.
As part of the settlement, Musk and Tesla will pay $20 million each, and Musk will resign as chairman for three years, a position similar to that of the German chief executive.
On the other hand, he may remain chief executive.
In the settlement, which has yet to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted wrongdoing.
The SEC had sued the globally known manager in Manhattan Federal Court for fraud.
Musk, who also chairs the space company SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-making electric car pioneer, which is now valued at more than $50 billion on the stock exchange.
Musk is not aware of any fault.
Musk said he had done nothing wrong and was saddened and disappointed by the lawsuit.
He has always acted in the interests of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk had written to his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might take the company off the stock market, paying $420 per share, with the funding secured.
This would value Tesla at a total of $72 billion.
Later, Musk rowed back: Tesla remained on the stock exchange.
Following the agreement, Tesla must now find an outside chairman, hire two independent board members, and set up a committee to oversee Musk's communications.

Just before the end, sturridge redeemed the Reds with a slack shot.
Record-breaking Manchester United are plunging deeper into crisis after their worst start to the season since 1989.
The controversial coach José Mourinho's team lost 1: 3 (0: 2) at West Ham United and remains in mid-table with ten points after seven days of play.
The pressure on Mourinho will continue to grow ahead of Tuesday's Champions League match against FC Valencia.
The former Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno arrived for his first Premier League match after an injury to Petr Cech.

The dance expert became known through the RTL show "Let's Dance."

Polls: 46 percent do not want Merkel to be chancellor until 2021
After the squabbles of the past weeks, the GroKo is taking several low marks in the poll.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in a survey - Angela Merkel is seen critically.
Berlin - The AfD has overtaken the SPD for the first time nationwide in the emnid Sunday trend for Sunday's Bild.
In the weekly poll by the opinion research institute, the AfD is up by one point to 17 percent, the SPD is down one point compared to the previous week and ends up at 16 percent.
The CDU and CSU also lose one count and only reach 27 percent.
This is the deepest value for the Union so far in the Sunday trend.
The Greens reach 15 percent, the Left 11 percent and the FDP 10 percent.
If the Bundestag were to be held on Sunday, the governing parties SPD, CDU and CSU would together receive only 43 percent of the vote, according to Emnid.
This means that the grand coalition has currently lost its majority on the Sunday issue in all the major research institutes - with the exception of Allensbach.
The governing parties consistently get 43 to 45 percent of the votes (Allensbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 Bundestag election, they still received a combined 53.4 percent.
For the other parties, the range is also wide: The AfD, the second-strongest party in several polls, comes in at between 15 and 18 percent.
The Green Party gets 12.5 to 17 percent of the vote.
The left is averaging 10 percent, the FDP at 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, depending on the percentage of votes, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down.
But support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) among the population has also fallen significantly since the 2017 Bundestag election.
Currently, only 48 percent of citizens think Merkel is the right person in the chancellor's office, according to the Emnid survey commissioned by BamS.
According to the survey, only one in two (50 percent) currently wants the grand coalition to hold until the next regular Bundestag election in three years, while 41 percent are in favour of a new election.
Another poll published on Saturday also showed significant losses in popularity for Merkel.
The Germans are also divided over whether Merkel should run again for CDU presidency in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are in favour, while 44 percent are against.
According to this, 64 percent of supporters of the Union want a candidacy, while 35 percent do not.
Aldi display: Reduced price for love happiness
Is Aldi turning into Tinder 2.0?
Anyone who says there are no romantic connoisseur stories in Tinder times - they should talk about turkey meat at Aldi.
Munich - In times of digital "fast food dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket as a connoisseur's place for great love radiates an almost anachronistic romance.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxershort bargains at the woolly table or the favourite pudding is, in doubt, still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The Tinder app has a reputation for being less a contact, but rather a slippery stock market.
We have taken the test: How do women react if they don't talk around the hot brew for a long time in the first message?
Here is the amazing result.
It has real Hollywood Lovestory potential when love happiness is preceded by an out-of-sight-lost-and-found-again plot.
If the guy then reports to his devotees at bio-Putenfleisch @ gmx.de at the e-mail address, then that sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and consort - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
Thus, it is entirely to be hoped that the author of this advertisement in an Aldi branch, which is unknown to us, will also find her dream man, with whom she briefly talked about the "30 percent reduced organic turkey meat."
For believing in the magic of getting to know one another, she definitely deserved her happy ending à la Hollywood.
Billerbeck: 500 lids for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, Ludgerischule has been involved in the campaign "Cover against polio - 500 lids for a life without polio."
Polio is the abbreviation for poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by polio.

The cause of poliomyelitis, polio, can only be contained by vaccinations, according to a press release.
Football: Reus and Zorc call for calm for Götze
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB sports director Michael Zorc and captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public discussion about Mario Götze's form and fitness.
"We should stop worrying about Mario.
That does the boy no good.
And that does us no good, "said Reus, who is friends with Götze, after the 4: 2 victory in Leverkusen at the Sky TV channel.
Zorc had already stressed before the game.
For him personally, this is not an easy situation.
Football: Eberl: No hurry in contract talks with Hecking
Mönchengladbach (dpa) - Manager Max Eberl of the German Football League Borussia Mönchengladbach is in no hurry for a possible contract extension with coach Dieter Hecking.
We have not even discussed a treaty yet.
There is no fixed date when we will do it.
"But there will certainly be the moment when we sit down and talk," Eberl said on Sky TV on Sunday evening.
Football: District League: VfL Wolbeck researchers' performance against SC Altenrheine gives courage
There were moments in this young season when Alois went into the court with his team-mates.
Wordlessly, he, the coach of the football district league VfL Wolbeck, retired (internally) to ponder the lack of willingness to perform on the green.
All history.
In the meantime, things are back to normal on the Brandhoveweg.
The 1: 1 result on Sunday against SC Altenrheine is proof of this, and in the past season only narrowly missed the ascent.
Yes, I am very happy with the performance.
"We tightened the spaces and put pressure on the ball.
He was able to see that, "lauded his boys fatally, and went after each and every one of them to simply say" thank you "for so much opposition to the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.
After the injury to Nico Frerich (muscular problems) - Luca Rehberg came for him - things went from 4-4-2 almost seamlessly into a 4-2-3-1, where Niklas Thewes was waiting for balls in front.
Wolbeck had significantly more games in the first section.
And opportunities.
But Frerichs, before leaving (17th), Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
This was almost avenged when the SCA struck dangerously in front of the Wolbecker Box in minute 41 two times in the person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbräuer - goal man Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his field.
After the break, VfL took full control.
Thewes fell short from 18 metres.
Schroer, too, came too late in a Thewes goal after 58 minutes.
With the altercation of Miles Geske, Fat again missed a fresh cell cure on the left side.
When Altenrhein's Chris Naberbräuer felled Robin Westhues in the 70th minute, there was an indirect free kick for the hosts 18 metres in front of the guest enclosure.
The Gefoulte himself stepped in and demonstrated his dangerousness in standards.
Westhues "thing with his right butt struck from the shooter's point of view - 1: 0 (71).
Another 20 minutes that should be damned.
And then: VfL captain Florian Quabeck was unlucky to get his hands on the leather in the penalty area in the 80th minute.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the spot.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79.).
Wolbeck had to endure anxious minutes in the final phase before Geske scored from twelve metres out in the 87th minute.
Perhaps it would have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26. L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66. Geske) - Thewes

Eintracht Frankfurt wins 4: 1 against Hannover 96
Starting point: Four points after five days of play - that was not enough for coach Adi Hütter.
Against Hannover 96, Eintracht Frankfurt finally wanted to secure their first home win.
Striker Ante Rebic, who was in the starting line-up for the first time after suffering an injury, should help.
Midfielder Luca Torró was also back after a hamstring injury and, with his head ball strength, should prevent the SGE from scoring more goals according to standards.
Reading material before the game: How Eintracht Frankfurt wants to push upwards, which construction sites Eintracht Frankfurt will have to close fairly soon - and how Allan Souza somehow wants to prevail at Eintracht Frankfurt.

Helicopter crashed in Kottingbrunn
The crash occurred while landing at the airfield.
The four inmates were slightly injured.
A drama took place at the airport in Kottingbrunn at around 2pm on Sunday.
There was turbulence when a helicopter landed, police confirmed to oe24.
The heli was hit by a gust of wind, crashed to the ground and came to a halt on the side.
Police, rescue and fire brigade were immediately informed.
The emergency services arrived at the scene of the accident with a large team.
The ÖAMTC emergency medical helicopter was also called out for caution.
Occupants only slightly injured
Fortunately, everything turned out to be largely harmless.
There is only material damage.
The four inmates were only slightly injured and were able to return home on their own.
The exact circumstances surrounding the accident have not yet been clarified and are being investigated.
According to fire brigade spokesman Franz Resperger, there was a small fire, which was quickly extinguished.
Allbright Foundation report: Women remain a rarity on company boards
Thus, only 8 percent of the board members were female as of 1 September, according to the report "The Power of monoculture," which will be officially presented this Monday by the Allbright Foundation and was previously available to the German Press Agency.
"Companies will have to change their position, otherwise international competitors will pass them by," said Foundation CEO Wiebke Ankersen.
In the USA, Great Britain or Sweden, male-only management teams - with a few exceptions - are no longer conceivable.
The backlog makes German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented.
It's a different corporate culture.
In addition, the slight increase in the proportion of women among German stock exchange companies was due solely to positive impulses among companies in the index of medium-sized stocks (MDax).
According to Allbright data, only 6.8 percent of board members are female.
In the previous year, however, the figure was still 3.8 percent.
Among the 30 Dax companies - pioneers in recent years - the proportion of women has stagnated.
Most recently, 26 women worked on the boards.
"I'm sure that the Dax companies will recruit more consistently women in the coming year - in their own interests," Ankersen said.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement have signalled that they will not commit themselves to increasing the proportion of "zero percent" so far.
Another picture emerges for the supervisory boards: As of 1 September, the proportion of women there was 30.5 per cent - 45 per cent more women and 68 fewer men than a year ago.
"If just as many women were recruited for the boards every year, a share of 40 percent would have been reached by 2023," the report says.
Some even make a meadow: Luxury bodies: Which manufacturer earns the most per car?
Best deserved Ferrari.
The Italians take 280,000 euros with each Ferrari sold and make 69,000 euros in operating profit.
Big cars, big profits: This slogan still applies today - in most cases.
The one who makes the most profit per car among the noble operators.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do luxury car manufacturers pay per car they sell?
"Autopapst" and economics professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer addressed this question.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
Ferrari made an operating profit of €69,000 for each car sold in the first half of the year - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, is only worth around €800, and Tesla and Bentley are even investing heavily in every car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well into the race with prices averaging between 33,000 and 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros in earnings before interest and tax EBIT.

She did not reveal the date of birth.
Torch procession for the opening of the 60th Abtswinder wine festival
The tourist association in Abtswind opened its wine festival session with a torch-lit procession.
For the 60th time, the association is organizing the wine festivals, which from now on will take place every Saturday in October in the large tent on Rehweiler Strasse.
To mark the start of the anniversary, those in charge walked through the town to the festival square under the sounds of the "Spielmannszug" from Wiesenbronn.
The chairman of the tourist association, Wolfgang Starz, Mayor Jürgen Schulz and wine princess Lisa Kursawe welcomed the guests in the already full-bodied tent. "To organise something like this for 60 years is a madness for a small town with 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of that, "Starz thanked all the helpers.
Wine princess Lisa II later symbolically joined the guests from the stage.
"It's nice that so many have found their way back to us after downwind." Later, "Die Troglauer" created a mood.
On Sunday, when the Abtswinder Kirchweih was also celebrated, on the occasion of the anniversary in the afternoon, the association had set the drinks prices as they did 60 years ago.
A celebration of the 60th Wine Festival will take place on Friday, October 5, in the guest's house, before going into the second round a day later in the marquee.
Bonn: Emergency car crashes into taxi
An emergency medical van stands heavily damaged next to a road.
A 27-year-old woman passer-by was fatally injured in the collision between an emergency vehicle and a taxi.
When emergency physicians are called, they are called to help - preferably to save lives.
Such a rescue drive came to a deadly end in Bonn for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - A 26-year-old pedestrian has been fatally injured in a collision between an emergency medical van and a taxi in Bonn.
The taxi driver, emergency medical technician and their driver were seriously injured, police said.
The 46-year-old driver of the emergency car had crossed a red light on Saturday afternoon with blue lights and martinshorn.
He then collided at an intersection with the taxi, which was driving at green.
After the collision, the doctor's car slammed against a traffic light and a tree.
He grabbed the passerby, who was still dying at the scene of the accident.
Driver of emergency car and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the emergency van were seriously injured in their vehicles and had to be freed by emergency services.
The 29-year-old emergency medical technician, who was also seriously injured, was able to free herself, but she could no longer help the pedestrian.
Another emergency doctor called in tried - but to no avail.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
Police, in close coordination with the Bonn prosecutor's office, are investigating who is to blame for the accident.
Manchester United lose again, for Mourinho we find it uncomfortable
Manchester United will now also lose in the 7th round of the Premier League after their embarrassing exit in the league cup.
Against West Ham United, ManU is 1: 3. The manner of the defeat is likely to speak for itself.
The scene was emblematic in the 74th minute, when the returning Marko Arnautovic scored 3-1 for West Ham; just three minutes after Marcus Rashford had supposedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
Suspecting an offside in Mark Nobel's pass, all Manchester City defenders stopped and Arnautovic had all the time to fire the ball past the helpless David de Gea.
It was the negative climax of a performance that was already inadequate for long stretches.
The current mood is very different among United's city rivals Manchester City.
The Citizens, trained by Mourinho's great rival Pep Guardiola, came up against Brighton & Hove Albion for a 2-0 win.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke the outsider's defensive bar for the home team for the first time.
Sergio Agüero, after a good hour and a double pass with the former goalscorer, ensured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer table leaders
Three days after the 1-2 defeat in the league cup, Xherdan Shaqiri won a 1-1 with Liverpool in the Premier League against Chelsea.
As in the cup final, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man at the London derby.
The 27-year-old's strike in the 25th minute remained the only hit of the game until the closing stages.
Shaqiri, who came on for Mohamed Salah in the 66th minute, narrowly missed the equaliser after 70 minutes.
Daniel sturridge did better in the 89th minute with his lob.
So, after the Reds started the week with a flawless record, Chelsea could not be beaten for the second time.
First, the Londoners eliminated Jürgen Klopp's team in the Cup, and by winning the league, the Blues now also dropped Liverpool from the top of the table.
Like City, London's two city clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) celebrated 2-0 victories.
However, the fans of the Gunners, where Granit xhaka played, had to wait until the 81st minute for a message of success against the surprise team from the county of Hertfordshire.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart unhappily poked a pass from Alex Iwobi into his own goal, only two minutes later Mesut Özil made the decision with his third goal of the season.
Arsenal edged past Watford thanks to their fifth successive win and are now fifth behind their great rival Tottenham, leaving a strong impression that Wolverhampton will continue to rise under their Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
Wolves remained unbeaten in the league for the fifth time in a row at 2-0 against Southampton, finishing 8th.
VW's core brand is missing: Paris Motor Show under the spotlight of diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years, alternating with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially not an issue, but omnipresent: The diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofits should not be let go of German car companies at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 Motor Show, they will present their new products in the French capital from next week, together with the competition from all over the world.
In fact, diesel no longer plays a major role.
Nevertheless, the possible exchange and post-sale offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are still to be negotiated with the government in Berlin, are likely to be an important topic, at least behind the shiny scenes of the exhibition stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen Group is there with Audi, Porsche and other subsidiaries, but not with the core VW brand itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and, among other things, have their first pure electric models with them: The Ingolstadt e-tron is due to be launched at the end of the year, and the Stuttgart EQC in 2019.
But both have already been officially presented.
BMW's iNEXT is not due to start until 2021.
The focus in Paris is on the new 3-series.
A total of more than 250 exhibitors will be represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle manufacturers as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are also present in their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in alternation with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, more than a million visitors came.
At least 380 people have died on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi in the severe earthquakes and subsequent tsunami.
Dozens are still missing.
In addition, there are more than 500 injured.
The island was shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first was 5.9 and the second 7.4.
Communication and transport links have been damaged and there has been enormous material damage.
After the quakes, the tsunami swept across the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds had gathered on the beach for a party.
It is feared that the number of casualties will rise significantly.
Up to now, the figures have only come from Palu.
However, numerous other communities are also affected - along Sulawesi's west coast.
About 150 bikers celebrate service in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schroeder (right) from Herne celebrated the final service for the motorcyclists in the Peace Church in Eveking on Sunday with a team of helpers.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
At least the final service for the bikers was on the agenda.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and is thus responsible for the pastoral concerns of the two-wheelers, who are strong on horsepower.
Between April and September, the traditional motorbike service (MoGo) takes place on the last Sunday of a month at Haus Nordhelle.
Bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the Peace Church in Eveking.
On Sunday, around 150 bikers gathered there to conduct a service that was anything but ordinary.
As early as 10 a.m., the cars were lined up in front of the entrance portal of the church.
First of all, the biker early shopping was on the agenda and could be strengthened with coffee and cake, or even with a hearty curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, there were also Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach.
The sermon was delivered during the biker service by priest Dirk Grählrek.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided the musical background.
"Although the bikers prefer blues rock, Valerie Lill strikes a more poetic and calm tone," said Pastor Frank Schröder.
This too was certainly a novelty in the history of the motorcycle service yesterday.
Füchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates great feast: After the apple comes the milk
Borisch was also active during the actual day of action.
She supplied her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest.
He carried his apple press and, step by step, demonstrated the process from ripe apple to apple juice to his astonished spectators.
Now and then, Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and let them fill the apples in the big funnel.
With a little muscle strength, the apples became a finely shredded mass.
Not many of the children could yet imagine how it would turn into a tasty drink.
But they were also able to look at this important step on this late Friday afternoon.
Wrapped in moulds and wrapped in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the apple pieces, which look a little like chopped goods, on top of each other layer by layer.
Thanks to a certain level of technical support, the final step was no longer difficult.
The freshly squeezed juice gradually ran into a large container.
But the farmer from Füchtorfer also had ready-bottled specialities with him.
So he opened his "treasure chest" and presented the latest feather whites to older visitors.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was correspondingly high.
In a cosy atmosphere, the parents talked, while the children were not only able to follow the process of apple pressing, but also discovered the built-up bouncy castle.
Active members of the Füchtorf comradeship of former soldiers also engaged in the festivities and invited them to play at some stations.
The hometown club will also be offering a day of action next year.
But then, Gregor Krützkamp stressed, the home in the heart of the asparagus village will not be the place to be.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the topic: Finally, it will be all about the milk.
1: 4 against Frankfurt: Hanover with fourth bust of the season: "Shitty situation"
Frankfurt / Main After the fourth successive Bundesliga defeat, coach André breitenreiter rallied his disappointed professionals from Hannover 96 around him and courted them.
However, there was not much positive in the 1: 4 (0: 2) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shitty situation, but you've got to get out of it as a team," said 96-year-old football professional Pirmin Schwegler, pausing: "It's disappointing, of course, because you always have a lot going for you."
The still undefeated Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86th) joined, are at the bottom with two counts and are a relegation candidate in their current condition.
Led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt, on the other hand, celebrated their first home win of the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45th + 1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59th) and Luka Jovic (89th) scored in front of 46,300 spectators for the DFB cup winner, who, after the successful rehearsal for the Europa League match against Lazio in Rome, advanced to the mid-table with seven points.
Croatia's vice-world champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive action of the Hessen in his starting debut and never got to grips with Hannover's defence.
With his pace and assertiveness, the striker, who was a long shot after the World Cup, showed why he is so valuable for the tie.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, who was on loan from Liverpool FC, was for the first time in the initial formation of Frankfurt, which began to swing.
A header deflected onto the net by Lucas Torró (17th) put them in danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller, in a promising position, was stopped at the last moment by the 96 defence around the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-term Kevin Wimmer (back).
The leadership for the owners was almost inevitable and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penalty area after a deflected corner, Haller extended it head-on in front of the goal, where Ndicka only needed to keep his foot up.
It was the first league goal for the defender, who came from the French second-division side AJ Auxerre in the summer.
And Frankfurt was down before the break.
This time, Haller matched his storm partner Rebic, who competed skillfully and left 96-year-old goalkeeper Michael Esser with no chance.
At half-time, Hannover coach reacted more broadly to the poor performance of his team, bringing in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt two new offensive forces.
Although the Lower Saxony played a little more boldly forward, igniting ideas remained until just before the end, when the connecting goal was still possible.
The Hessen were much more efficient.
After less than an hour, Rebic launched a solo shot and then put it squarely on De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty net.
The rest was just a show for the Frankfurt team against overwhelmed guests, with Jovic also hitting a minute before the end.
Morlaixplatz becomes a party mile
Würselen Despite cool temperatures, there was a good atmosphere at the Oktoberfest in the city centre.
The Mayor of Munich, Dieter Reiter, made it in front of an audience of millions at the opening of the 185.
Munich Wies'n took two beats last week.
Geisingen: Geisinger Christians celebrate Holy Cross Festival
The Geisi Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross Festival on September 14 or the Sunday after.
The service will take place in the town church, followed by a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the final blessing.
The Church of the Holy Cross houses the shot of Christ, a 30-year-old warrior, whom it is said was shot by a Swedish soldier.
Blood then flowed from the gunshot wound.
This led to a great pilgrimage to the shot-dead Christ, which also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
It has not yet been completed, only the altarpiece stands, the missing longhouse is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Father Adolf Buhl recalls that the cross is a sign of hope, consolation and life.
The service was poorly attended, despite its importance to the Geisinger parish.
After the service, the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and the church part of the cross ended with the final blessing.
For many years, the Catholic church choir has been inviting people to the Catholic home for the secular part of the festival.
The choir members provided the visitors with hearty meals as well as a large selection of cakes and adapted to the weather, Bauernhofeis.
In the afternoon, the parish still offered guided tours around the town church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed the visitors on behalf of the parish about the damage to the facade, roof, sandstone work and windows, as well as the upcoming building measures, which will continue into next year.
Since the scaffolding has been in place for some time, the damage has been identified more precisely and the individual tenders have been prepared more specifically.
What is certain is that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage that already existed a few years ago has increased, but more has also been found, which was only made possible by the inspection by means of scaffolding.
The plinth plastering work has been completed, the natural stone work is due to begin before the winter, and it is hoped that half of these works will be completed this year.
Inauguration: New residential home on Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstrasse
In Münsterblickstrasse, Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller is opening a new residential home for people with disabilities.
The fact that "a very special house" is now being handed over to its destination in Münsterblickstrasse - all those present at the inauguration were in agreement.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the living quarters of the Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller for some time depend on the special architecture of the new building.
In his concept, architect Rudolf Bader has considered wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas.
The first planning began around eight years ago, when the former US Army officer's building was put to the test for residents with a mobile phone cap: "The house had come into the years and was no longer up-to-date in terms of equipment," Bader explained in retrospect.
In 2016, excavators arrived to demolish the house.
The new building should be as friendly and bright as possible, so that residents can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Life support Danube-Iller opens new residential home
Life support invested around 4.6 million euros in the new building.
The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros, the district of Swabia 450,000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction work has remained within the planned framework - both in time and financially.
The life support manager, Jürgen Heinz, also thanked him for this.
The balancing act between an barrier-free and at the same time fire-safe construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen, with the many requirements, had built a home that allowed the residents the freedom to move even without foreign help.
Gertrud Kreutmayer, head of the social administration of the district of Swabia, said similarly: "The house is oriented towards the special needs of its inhabitants, who need tools to be mobile."
The comfort and functionality were well combined, said Kreutmayer.
And further: "The property in this location is a real stroke of luck, because it can no longer be purchased in the current situation."
In total, the new residential home in Münsterblickstrasse offers space on almost 1500 square metres for 30 people with disabilities, divided into three residential groups.
Life support managing director Heinz is proud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed according to tariffs.
Germany: Schwesig bemoans differences between East and West
Berlin - Before Unity Day, the SPD deputy leader, Manuela Schwesig, has appealed to all her fellow countrymen not to resign themselves to the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unity.
We cannot be satisfied with these differences, "the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern told the Tagesspiegel am Sonntag.
The goal must remain to create a level playing field throughout the country.
It was unacceptable that, on average, East Germans worked longer hours than people in West Germany, but received 15 percent less salary.
"I can't explain this to anyone almost 30 years after German unity," Schwesig said.
North Korea: Is this cute dog ending the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan hunting dog aims to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to ease relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has given South Korean President Moon Jae-In two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs.
Moon's office said Sunday that the two dogs, about one year old, reached their recipient as early as Thursday.
According to them, they passed through the border town of Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog food in order to "make it easier for the animals to get used to."
The dogs with thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They are part of the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The North announced the friendship at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in mid-September.
The two countries also agreed to compete together in international sports competitions, such as the 2020 Olympic Games, and jointly bid to host the 2032 Olympic Games.
In the course of the mutual rapprochement, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket propulsion.
Austria's turbulent history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months in this year of remembrance, numerous new books have been published, which usually answer this question in retrospect to the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director general of the Austrian State Archives, puts it in a very different light in the magnificent "picture book" Austria, which will be published on 1 October.
New week, new opportunity for the government
Back to substantive work - this is the unofficial motto for the Grand Coalition's work week, which begins today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the chancellor and her ministers from the CDU, the SPD and the CSU have summoned not least mantraly the "return to substantive work."
This may have led some artisans, doctors, cashiers and other working people in this country to ask the legitimate question of what is actually the difference between work and non-work work, but be it.
If the federal government is now ready to rededicate itself to its mission - governing - it should not be deterred from it by debates on concepts.
Whether the Union and the SPD can actually achieve something together after the provocations and blunders of the last few weeks, may already be revealed on Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the governing parties will meet in the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round on a regular basis in order to defuse conflicts early; a lesson from all the quarrels.
First of all, however, conflicting issues are on the agenda again with diesel retrofits and the Specialist Immigration Act.
The CSU transport minister, Scheuer, wants the car companies to get away easily with exchange premiums, while the SPD and CDU see the manufacturers as having a duty to retrofit older diesel engines.
While the weekend's diesel crisis has brought about a rapprochement, the Union and the SPD are still a long way apart on the planned law on skilled labour immigration.
The SPD is calling for a stay perspective for rejected asylum seekers who work or train.
The Union is strongly opposed to the "change of lanes" from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will again be quarrels among the coalition partners - and how should it be different?
Not the same and the same have merged to form GroKo, but three partners with sometimes very different company profiles and priorities.
The dispute is a good one.
Without controversy, a society marked by such diverse and sometimes contradictory interests does not progress.
But in order to be constructive, quarrels must not be reopened for party tactical reasons to the question of being or not being.
This is still about politics, not theatre.
Union and SPD should argue - but always keep an eye on the reality of people's lives.
What is feasible and useful for many?
With this key question, both the diesel and the lane change question can be clarified pragmatically - and thus regained confidence.
Above all, this is what the popular parties must now fight for.
Mushroom checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister targeted
Does the Minister of Labour, of all people, contravene the law on the right to work?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look.
"Really day and night" their legions have been working on social insurance reform, reported an exuberant Social Affairs Minister during the presentation of the same two weeks ago.
In the case of list mushroom mandatine Daniela Holzinger, the statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) is met with astonishment - she is now taking the matter to parliament via question.
She believes that "the minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm for the work of her team and not to proclaim violations of the law of service in front of cameras."
Nevertheless, she now has questions in order to "free" Har ­ tinger from any suspicion.
Police tear up a street in search for woman's body
Marxgrün - The police did not want to comment.
Now there is confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, digging has been taking place on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben.
The route is closed until Monday in the Marxgrün area.
It was preceded by the fact that the investigators had previously used an archaeology dog.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, was finally able to narrow the relevant spot down to a few metres, together with its leader in several operations.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered in the area of the said section of the road together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the top Bavarian monument protection authority.
For more than a year, the public prosecutor's office and the criminal police Hof have been handling the missing person case.
Again and again, a cycle path was blocked at Marxgrün and examined with sonar equipment, because investigators suspect that Heike's body may have been buried here during the construction of the new state road 30 years ago.
Colour powder and eggs: Barcelona riots ahead of Catalonia anniversary
Monday marks the first anniversary of Catalonia's disputed independence referendum.
But there have been riots before.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of 1 October 2017, clashes broke out between separatists and police in central Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by pro-independence demonstrators with paint powder, among other things, as they tried to prevent them from approaching a National Police and Civil Guard demonstration.
Around 3000 officers from the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil police units planned to pay tribute to their colleagues who were at the polling stations last year in what was considered an illegal referendum.
The attempt to prevent citizens from voting also resulted in violence at the time.
The Catalan police have formed a chain to keep separatist demonstrations and central state security forces separate, Spanish media reported.
However, some of the 6000 or so separatists then attempted to break through the police chain by force and threw bags of paint and eggs at the officers, among others.
Six people were arrested and 24 others were slightly injured, the authorities said.
Monday marks the first anniversary of the independence referendum.
Following the vote and subsequent decision to secede the wealthy region from Spain, the central government in Madrid placed Catalonia under forced administration in the autumn of 2017.
The then regional president, Carles Puigdemont, fled to Belgium in exile.
Other politicians also defected abroad.
On the other hand, several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement remain in custody.
New elections were held in the region in December.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, the administration was terminated.
But the new regional president, Quim Torra, also insists on the "right to self-determination" of Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Assembled helplessness: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen separate without a goal
Red-white Ahlen continues to stand on the spot.
Even with FC Gütersloh, it was only a 0-0 draw.
In front of 438 spectators at the Heidewaldstadion, the final and the third last one turned out to be a total of perplexity.
The first half was very manageable due to the entertainment factor.
Therefore, those who preferred to get a beer or a bratwurst could do so without worry.
There was no risk of missing a goal chance, because there was practically none.
First shot after half an hour
For the first (harmless) goal shot of the entire match, Nick Flock was responsible for the goods in the 28th minute.
The Ahleners had the best - and in principle the only real - opportunity when Cihan Yilmaz forced FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling into a parade with a shot from the penalty area after 32 minutes.
The hosts were even more harmless.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Striker Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, Sinan Aygün came for him.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the increasing boredom.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mützel aimed from 18 metres just over the crossbar and after an hour, the Gütersloans also made an offensive appearance for the first time.
After Matthew Wieckowicz won the ball, things were fixed.
Nick Flock (62) "crowned" the keeper of Sinan Aygün, who was quickly subdued, with a shot into the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
They also trailed by a header from Wieckowicz (66.) after a corner ball from ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut reacted, bringing first Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60.) and later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70.).
It worked - nothing.
The Ahleners did not achieve more than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative.
It was only in the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but neither did he score.
Angelo Daut then tried to point out the positive: "I like the fact that we played to zero," but unfortunately the zero was also at the front.
"We were not as dangerous as against Holzwickede this time and even though our opponent had no desire to play here," said RW Ahlen's interim coach.
Offensively, "everything was a little bit like that" against a team "that just wanted to defend.
In any case, I didn't feel we could get the opposite, "Daut said.
To his sorrow, however, the spectator did not feel as if his team could score a goal.
The performance was too poor for that.
Reckenfelder harvest market: Fortunately, there are enough Kreimers
This is something Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Tafelausgabstelle, for whom these donations are intended.
The volunteers assure: "These donations will also remain in Reckenfeld."
At the opening, the sky was bright blue, whereas the square was still a little empty, but that was to change during the day.
Because: "It's so nice and sociable here, that's why we're here today," said a visitor.
Organiser of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus greeted the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit, as always, with a good dose of humour.
For the Brockmann couple, who were supposed to be weighed against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in at short notice.
Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has fallen ill.
But there are enough Kreimers.
And the "replacement" could not fail to entertain the increasingly increasing number of visitors musically in between.
It was so good that a few folk songs were sung along at a late hour.
"Just great," Marcel Kreimer was pleased.
This time, Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to place the opening date in his schedule.
He is pleased with the many active players with their stands, mostly clubs.
"Actually, there should be no such thing as a plaque," he nevertheless thanked for the action of the male choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the efforts of all those who were on duty at the stands and also included the other festivals held in September and the "Clean up" campaign.
Our garden city gives itself a colorful coat of paint - there's something going on here.
Then Georg Knorr and Gerd Kluckily took the Maikranz with the help of the fire brigade and took it to the winter quarters.
Many booths were used for physical well-being.
Everything was to be had from sweetness to heartbreak.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has lived in Reckenfeld for only a year, got creative with his decorative saw.
He had veneer work, beer covers with Reckenfeld motifs and a lot more on offer.
Three Reckenfeld beekeepers offered a specialty: "Reckenfelder honey," brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschluter.
The latter has another specialty.
Honey cake in glass, of course with honey from my own production.
Little Elsa had to access it again and again, and the cake tasted so good.
It is the conviviality that made the visitors linger long into the evening, even without a stage programme, which does not exist at the autumn festival.
Lubricants with a local political message: Not a successful advertisement for a skate park
In Lengerich, unknowns have promoted the construction of a skate facility in a way that is hardly conducive.
There are lubricants in several places, says Jürgen Kohne from the city council, when asked by the WN.
In at least one case, criminal charges of property damage have been filed with the police.
The three words "Skatepark für Lengerich!" Are emblazoned in large letters on signs at, among others, the Gempt Hall and the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that already after the trade fair on 19 September, a corresponding lettering was discovered on the advertising sign at the staircase to the Gempt bistro.
Since the short message was apparently "only" left with Edding at the time, it could easily be removed.
"A few days later, however, it was back, this time sprayed," Rottmann said.
He believes that the appropriate advertising label must be replaced.
This case gets a special note precisely because several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the board.
If the skatepark is built, its realization should also be made possible by sponsors.
According to Jörg Hesselmann from the municipal department of school, sport and culture, there are already commitments, without mentioning names.
It is possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that stand on the smeared plaque.
For years, local politics and administration have been concerned with the subject of skating facilities.
After the old one had been dismantled at the LWL clinic, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
Finally, the majority of the council voted in favour of the fire service parking lot.
However, this request was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against a construction at this point.
A U-turn followed at the end of June.
The members of the main and finance committee have now voted unanimously in favour of the Gutenberg School area.
Jürgen Kohne says of the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the midst of concrete planning.
The last word will then be given by the City Council.
He expects a decision to be made this year, so a positive vote in 2019 could allow it to be built.
Air traffic control bottleneck gets worse
Frankfurt / Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, in 2019 we will have strong winds and then the storm will come," the head of the air traffic control union, Matthias Maas, told the German Press Agency ahead of the aviation summit on 5 October in Hamburg.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight cancellations is the long-known shortage of staff in European air traffic control systems, for which there is no quick fix.
"Airlines and airports can make rapid improvements for the coming year, but training new pilots takes four to five years," said the trade unionist.
Throughout Europe, the market for fully trained pilots has been swept away.
In the centre of Karlsruhe alone, around one hundred people were missing to monitor the upper German airspace.
Maas again criticised the fact that various aviation unions were not invited to the summit.
On Friday, representatives of the federal, state, air traffic control, airlines and airports will gather in the Hanseatic city to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work compaction and overtime, it won't be possible without us," explained the head of the GdF, which has many members at the German air traffic control company.
Maas again blamed the European Commission's requirements for the pilot malaise.
Traffic forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 have been far too low.
The resulting cost requirements and personnel savings in national air traffic control systems are now fully reflected in the operating business.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to work in Brussels for regulations that "do not cut off the air even further" for air traffic control systems.
At the moment, the EU guidelines are being coordinated until 2024 and further tightening is to be feared.
The EU is subject to constant lobbying from airlines.
"Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have been sowing themselves over the last few years," said Maas.
He hopes that the high cost of delays will lead airlines to rethink their thinking.
The GdF will only cooperate in improving the situation if German air traffic control (DFS) offers a "coherent training and future pact," said Maas.
The previously announced intake of 120 pilot pupils a year over the next five years is just enough to compensate for the age-related declines.
The necessary personnel increase is not yet connected with this.
ThyssenKrupp supervisory board votes in favour of corporate restructuring
The members of the Thyssenkrupp supervisory board have unanimously voted in favour of the plans to restructure the group.
According to the will of Thyssenkrupp interim CEO Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed chairman of the board at the meeting on Sunday, the crippling company is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies are to be based in Essen and listed on the stock exchange.
There should not be an additional reduction in staff beyond the already known cuts in administration.
After two resignations, the control board counts only eight heads on the capital side.
Ten representatives of the employees are opposed to this.
However, the final decision is expected to be taken at a general meeting in 2020.
Among other things, the new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is to include the 50 percent share from the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company, Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business will be bundled with lifts and supplies.
Barcelona: Violence at demos of police and Catalan independence supporters.
Two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police and Catalan independence supporters in Barcelona have seen violent clashes with scores of people injured.
According to the city council, about 3000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday as around 6000 pro-independence demonstrators demonstrated.
The Catalan police tried to keep the two protests away from each other with a large-scale riot.
According to the emergency services, pro-independence protesters repeatedly tried to break the security barrier.
They attacked the officers with paint and shotguns.
According to the information, there were also rants between the participants in the various protests.
According to rescue workers, 24 people were injured.
Police said there had been six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
With their demonstration, the policemen wanted to pay tribute to their colleagues who, almost exactly a year ago, were protesting against the independence referendum in Catalonia, which was banned by the Spanish central government.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel it is unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn significantly more than them.
The demonstrators felt it was a provocation that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?" 55-year-old Catalan demonstrator Manel Perez asked the AFP news agency.
Just to provoke and to celebrate the fact that they deceived us a year ago.
A 31-year-old Balearic police officer, who wanted to give his name only to Daniel, denied the accusation.
"Of course we want to support our comrades, who did their duty last year: To defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona, because it is a big European city and there is more echo here.
However, he and his colleagues "did not come to provoke," the policeman assured.
Breakdown allowed access to personal data of UK ministers
A vulnerability in a mobile phone app caused the personal details of ministers and Conservative Tory MPs to be temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknowns after the breakdown was revealed a day before the Tory party congress in Birmingham.
Two people trapped on B217
On Sunday morning, the Hanover Police Department reports a serious traffic accident on Federal Highway 217, Hamelner Chaussee, at the exit of Wettbergen in the direction of Ronnenberg.
Two people died when they drove their car against a tree.
The car is currently in flames.
Emergency personnel are on the scene.

Football: JUVE coach praises Ronaldo's best game after top score
The Portuguese star striker "played the best match this evening together with Valencia for half an hour," praised Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri after the record-breaking 3: 1 (1: 1) win against the SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensive star was the decisive man in the important match against the chasing team, even without an own goal.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and is doing well," Allegri said.
Even if we started with tactical errors, Ronaldo was very good in our first goal - and from that moment on we grew.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three goals, Juve turned the game after the early delay by beating Dries Mertens (10th minute) and, for the time being, hung off the worst of the chasers.
The Real Madrid goalkeeper first set up the former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who took the lead with a double (26th / 49th).
And Ronaldo, after a corner by header, also did the preparatory work for the strike from defence boss Leonardo Bonucci (76), who only had to push in short of the goal line.
"He has a lot of ideas," praised the coach.
But Allegri also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the record goalscorer in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
"We have to get even better at serving him," the coach demanded.
The best Juve goalscorer is currently mandzukic with four goals - Ronaldo has three.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million Euros, the supremacy of Juventus seems to be even more crushing.
Seven wins in seven games is the impeccable streak in Serie A. With 21 points, the champion of the past seven years already has a six-point lead over Naples.
The spreadsheet, which was trained by the former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti, was not without a chance against Turin.
But at the latest after the victory of Mario Rui (58), who had already been warned, the top position was decided.
The Portuguese was forced off the pitch with a yellow-and-red after getting too hard on Paulo dybala.
"We played well against a good Naples," commented the Turin coach.
Emre Can was also allowed to feel addressed.
The German national player has established himself at Juve.
The professional, who came from Liverpool FC, played in all seven league games.
The midfielder also played in the Champions League match against Valencia, which Allegri meant by "half an hour": Ronaldo had flown off the pitch in the 2: 0 win over Turin and is barred for Tuesday's home match against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West Changes His Name
Rapper Kanye West attracted attention with a particularly bizarre performance on the weekend's US TV show "Saturday Night Live."
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume caused a frown and question marks among the audience.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a name change on time for the release of his new album.
From now on, you can only call him "Ye," according to the musician.
"The essence formerly known as Kanye West," he tweeted, referring to the late singer Prince when he dropped his stage name.
However, the pseudonym is not news.
Already the tenth album was released under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist explained that "Ye" has a religious meaning for him.
"I think" Ye "is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means" you, "" the rapper said.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
Done!
Hoetmar's coach Averhage made no secret of his disappointment.
That was a weak game from us today.
The opponent was simply more effective, we almost never confronted him with any problems. "The list of Hoetmar's shooting options reads correspondingly thin.
Two chances of scoring in 90 minutes, so games can rarely be played in a positive manner.
Football Kreisliga A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0: 2 (0: 1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
SG also had only two opportunities in the first round, but Maik Krause took advantage of the first from a sharp angle to take the early lead (7).
In the 43rd minute, Steffen Uphus could have been raised, but after great work by Krause, he went free standing.
The hosts only had a double opportunity when, initially, Moritz Höne failed on goal-stealer Jos Schuhmacher and Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorster keeper.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49.), Julian Turl (61.) and Heinz Linnemann (69.) all awarded.
Moreover, Niklas Eilmann was also unable to use a trade penalty - Louis Kortenjann had saved with his hand on the goal line and saw red for it - for the score (75.).
It was only when Nils Berheide pushed the ball over the line that the match was decided (81).
"We had been very critical of each other before, but that was different today than in the last few weeks," Florian Kraus concluded.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77th Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90th Leibig), Turl.
Goals: 0: 1 Krause (7th), 0: 2 Berheide (81st).
Red card: Kortenjann (75th / Hoetmar).
Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectacle football in Albany: GW Albersloh undergoes Concordia with 3: 4
"I don't know what to think of it," he said.
"We didn't get any access to them," he said, presumably referring to the pliers with Colby McGill and Janis Kroeger, but also to all the other greens and whites who are playing with collective offensive drive.
Nevertheless, he was able to laugh: "It was a dirty win," he said, winking cheekily and drawing cheers from his players, on the other hand, the relief was that they had pulled themselves out of the affair with three points.
Mind you, after a duel between two teams, one of which, Albany, is playing for the championship and the other, Albersloh, is fighting for class.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes that lay behind him.
"This was by far our best performance of the season," he says.
"How we come back after 0: 2, how we go against one of the top teams in the league over the whole season, it was really phenomenal."
It is all the more bitter that you now have to drive home empty-handed.
Top goalscorer Lars Zymner took the hosts into the lead with his 12th goal of the season (24).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
He set an example for Fabian Fröhning (39.) at 2: 0 on the left.
We knew that, but you can't completely take out a player like that.
"That was madness, what he did," Lewandowski acknowledged the quality of the opponent without jealousy.
Shortly before the change of sides, his own penalty equalised: McGill's free-kick from the left sailed into the long net between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe (45th).
After the change of sides, it was McGill who scored the equaliser (59).
Then we went back and forth.
It was a cracking, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albany again (64th), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann equalised (69th).
Despite being overwhelmed, Albersloh was no longer able to counter the last Concordia hit (80.).
We must now turn our full focus to Wednesday.
"The game against Schapdetten, that's what we have to win now," Lewandowski said.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kroeger (87. Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87. Bareksai).
Goals: 1: 0 Zymner (24th), 2: 0 Fröhning (39th), 2: 1 McGill (45th), 2: 2 McGill (59th), 3: 2 Nübel (64th), 3: 3 P. Horstmann (69th), 4: 3 Jülkenbeck (80th).
Yellow-red: Atalan (74th / Albany).
Football: TSV Straßberg wins point against Primus
There was no winner in the National League duel between TSV Straßberg and FV Biberach.
The leader of the table had actually come for three points, but coach Oliver Pfaff's team did very well and in the end the game ended 0: 0.
Media: Entire board of Dynamo Dresden resigns
According to media reports, the entire football second division team, Dynamo Dresden, has resigned.
In the evening, several media agreed on a joint letter from the Saxony Committee.
A confirmation of the association was not initially available.
Internal power struggles at the former Federal League are said to be the reason for the withdrawal.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of pomp
Good that he is gone again.
There are only a few state guests whose departure in Germany provides as much relief as those of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The Turkish president was in Berlin and Cologne for three days, and many thought he should not have been invited.
Protestant Academy Tutzing: Celebrity guests and new offers
The Protestant Academy Tutzing is offering about 80 conferences until the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, France's President Emmanuel Macron has signalled that he wants to collect the price of tolerance personally in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: As Federal President, he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was a guest there.
For example, academy director Udo Hahn took him into account when he proudly said: "All Federal Presidents and Federal Chancellor have already been with us." However, the fact that celebrities keep turning up at the academy at Schloss Tutzing was also a topic during the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October, songwriter Konstantin Wecker will take part in a conference on spiritual experience from a philosophical perspective. On 29 September, the writer Frido Mann will attend a conference about his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, France's President Emmanuel Macron has also promised that he will personally accept the "Tolerance Prize" awarded to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which will also be presented to television presenter Dunja Hayali in another category (we reported).
The 80 or so meetings until the middle of 2019 have it all.
"The pension is not safe!" Says a conference title.
"SOS on Europe's borders" - this is how the Academy describes the "risky and deadly route across the Mediterranean."
"And to a conference on Syria:" Barbarity without limit. "
Arms deals, destruction, torture, death - war makes a mockery of every humane idea. "
The spectrum ranges from structural racism in society to the gap between rich and poor, to the radical change in work through digitalisation.
Academy Director Hahn was convinced: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to search for solutions or at least partial solutions."
At a meeting on the 200th anniversary.
On the occasion of Karl Marx's birthday, some expect more visitors to the direction of critique of capitalism, others a tendency "from left to centre."
What about neutrality?
"We are 100 percent a subsidiary of the Evangelical Church," said study leader Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100 percent neutral."
Music cabaret: Gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten
"Suitable for adults as well as men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christuskirche in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret artist, Teubner imagined gender understanding, not only with humour and warmth for the (felt) woman and the (felt) man and what else there may be, but also with music.
She used the mini-guitar and mastered her violin.
On the wing sat Ben Süverkrüp.
On the one hand, he is the male sparring partner, who sometimes speaks until the end of the movement, on the other hand a true pianist: Süverkrüp Teubner is so congenial and harmonious that some may have wished for a solo.
That was also the case, with Beethoven and Chopin, but in a different way, as befits the evening's theme.
Teubner had brought a paradox into play: The satisfaction with the man comes when he has a partner, but she does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, is of no use.
The piano solo is now demonstrating the same thing: What would have come from composing Mozart had "the Nannerl" opened the door unexpectedly?
So Süverkrüp glides over into improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt voll Blupt und Wunden" into the "Lied vom Tod," and from Mozart's G minor Symphony into a playful little dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Karlheinz kleintje, treasurer of the association, presented flowers to the chansonette.
But the chairman, Heidemarie Markenbeck, could not take additional thanks.
She had the idea to give the duo one in Wolbeck in addition to appearances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt.

Controversial tech billionaire Elon Musk may remain CEO of electric car maker Tesla, but will have to relinquish the chairmanship of the board of directors.
Musk also agreed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to pay a double-digit million-dollar fine, the SEC said.
The background is Musk's surprise announcement in August that he would remove Tesla from the stock market.
In its lawsuit, the SEC accused Musk of providing false and misleading information.
Bruchsal.
Following a bus accident on the A5 in Baden-Wuerttemberg, the police slightly revised the number of casualties down.
10 passengers were slightly injured instead of 15.
All have since been discharged from hospital.
The French bus driver remained in hospital for a night for observation.
He will be released later in the day, a police spokesman said.
The cause of the accident of the long-distance bus at Bruchsal is still unclear.
The long-distance bus crashed head-on against a guardrail on Saturday morning.
Handball: Women's National League: Ahlener SG narrowly retains white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlen women had problems in particular with the third-division player Carolin Stallmann, who scored ten goals alone.
"Actually, I was happy with the defence, only one player has scored too many goals.
We didn't get to grips with them, "says ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more angry about the many missed chances.
The concentration at the end was missed by his team this time.
For this reason, the ASG was behind almost to the end, was at the break with 11: 12 and later with 15: 18 (45) behind.
Only towards the end did the wider bench of the hosts make itself felt decisively.
In addition, Aydogdu put back room Merle Klement on the left flank, which then made "extremely clever the decisive goals" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pumpe, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5 / 3), Drewes (1), Schlaufmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3rd women's league: Top performance of BSV Ostbevern in top match at VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top match, the BSV Ostbevern women's volleyball players have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd League West.
The blue-whites won 3: 1 in the second league downhill, VC Allbau Essen.
"It was a huge step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz want to play in the top third of the league.
That is what we have now worked out, "said coach Dominik Münch after an almost impeccable performance by his team at the relegated table leader.
The first round was dominated by the guests almost at will.
Over 4: 1, 16: 10 and 22: 12, he went to last year's runner-up with 25: 15.
He accepted food in the two-person bar, but did not get into the game.
We employed them well.
Our opponent struck at high risk, but also produced a number of tickets.
In the second set, the BSV led with 12: 8. "Essen changed the assumption to three-on-three.
We could not keep the pressure on.
Food got sucked in, and we let ourselves be lulled in a bit, "Münch continued.
At 18: 17, the female volleyball players from the Ruhr region had their noses in front for the first time.
Although Ostbevern averted four more set balls at 19: 24, the fifth attempt found its target.
"The game was now a class better," said the head of the practice to the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed significantly to the BSV turning the page in the third section from 14: 16 to 25: 21.
Münch: "We played consistently and calmly."
Over 7: 3 and 15: 13, the blue-and-white players brought four passes with 25: 22 on their side.
Vera Horstmann was voted the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier also had an excellent day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish community: Mosque opening as missed opportunity
The Turkish Community in Germany (TGD) has criticised the manner in which Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan inaugurated the Great Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
"The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left a pile of scars in the German-Turkish relationship, which can only be painstakingly brought together," said the chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, to the editorial network Germany.
Both the Turkish and German sides missed the chance to make a joint, conciliatory appearance.
"Instead of emphasizing, side by side with German leaders, the belonging of Muslims to Germany, Erdogan has used the date for his purposes," complained Sofuoglu.
The widespread exclusion of the German public has "confirmed many reservations."
Home club Nottuln: Offer has already been established
After the long summer break, Folktreff is finally back.
On 18 October (Thursday) at 7.30 p.m., the Nottuln hometown club is already organizing its fifth Nottulner Folktreff in the fireplace room of the Alte Amtmannei.
It is then almost exactly one year since we first held a folk reunion.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln, "says Hanns Moormann, president of Nottulner Heimatverein.
I would not have thought that our folk reunion would take place so quickly in Nottuln.
Whether it was Stormlow Friederike in January or the heat wave in July, the fireplace room of the office was always full.
"The programme at the next Folktreff is, as always, a colourful mixture of German folk, hiking and seafaring songs, folk songs, evergreens and old hits," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who repeatedly invites friends to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer has promised his accordion for his first "birthday."
For many years he was a member of "Gaitling," a group from neighbouring Steinfurt, which played music with German texts.
Now he's on tour with an Irish folk band.
The creators of the Folk Tree fondly remember the last event in the summer, when Christoph Schulz from the Folktreff Emsdetten enthused the listeners with his international version of the song "Frogs in the Night" and sent them home with an earworm.
"We are counting on many cheerful guests to once again spend a convivial and humorous evening," says the invitation from the home club.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to be actively involved is invited to participate.
Since the coveted seats are always filled quickly, it is recommended to be there early enough.
The Folktreff starts at 7.30 p.m., but the entrance is already at 7 p.m.
China approves proposed merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October.
RottertLinde and Praxair are taking another step towards becoming the world's largest industrial gas company.
The Chinese competition authority has approved the proposed merger, Linde announced on Sunday.
This means that approvals in South Korea and - as the biggest hurdle - in the USA are pending for the multi-billion-dollar merger.
Most recently, according to an insider, the chances of getting approval there had improved because Linde has agreed to sell additional parts of the company.
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October for the merger to succeed.
From pure fruit growing to ecology
A gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle celebrated the 125th anniversary of the district association for horticulture and regional care.
On 29 September 1893, the last impulses for the founding of the district association for horticulture and regional care Kulmbach were put on display at the Kulmbach club house with a fruit show, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a great anniversary on Saturday evening in the Kulmbach town hall.
At the time, of course, it was called "Kulmbach Stadt und Land" (Kulmbach Town and Country District Building Society), which was launched by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit-growing association also differed from today's work - in fact, it was all about fruit growing, flowers and horticulture that nobody thought about at the time.
"At that time, in the Enlightenment period, the fruit tree was a favourite child of the elites," declared district home nurse Günter Dippold in his speech.
Fruit trees were to line highways, so-called industrial gardens were built at schools.
Fruit growing is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the Kulmbach district, which comprise almost 7,000 members.
But the spectrum is far from exhausted.
Natural horticulture, biological plant protection, village beautification and nutrition play an equally important role as the transfer of knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Mole" demonstrated how versatile the tasks of a horticultural club are.
"Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said the district president, Günter Reif, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed the importance of experiences in nature for life.
Collecting chestnuts was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that you can collect as much joy with smartphones.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with District Councillor Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"The district council decides where they should stand," added Söllner, emphasising the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.
The district association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green spaces in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district also left district manager and specialist consultant Friedhelm Haun in no doubt.
He led the many visitors through the long history of the district association with a lecture and reported, among other things, on the necessity of self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past, everything came from the garden, for the winter it was soaked.
By the end of the 1950s, however, the garden had turned into an ornamental and residential garden.
"Nature has persisted, it was there before us and we must be guided by it," argued the expert for fruit and nut trees.
That is why there is an incentive for the horticultural associations not to let up, so that our homeland remains beautiful and worth living.
This includes welcoming the new citizens to our clubs, added Wolfram Vaitl, president of the Bavarian State Association.
"We must stop the blatant decline of insects, we owe it to our children and grandchildren," concluded Günter Reif at the successful ceremony, which was ceremonially framed by the Thurnau music club tower blades.

Priority for Nafta talks: Canada foreign minister postpones UN speech
Mexico's government wants clarity on Nafta: It is issuing an ultimatum to both trading partners for an agreement.
Canada's foreign minister is now giving the trade deal absolute priority - and postponing her speech to the United Nations.
Due to the time pressure in the struggle for a renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the USA and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of speaking on Saturday, the minister will not address the General Assembly of the United Nations until Monday, said her spokesman Adam Austen.
In the meantime, she is focusing on renegotiating Nafta.
Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Friday that the negotiators of Canada and the USA had 48 hours to agree if Canada really wanted to accede to the trade agreement already reached between its country and the USA.
The U.S. and Mexico agreed in August to rewrite the Nafta regional free-trade agreement.
U.S. President Donald Trump indicated that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
Talks on a new edition have been going on for more than a year.
They are due to be completed by Sunday evening (local time), and Trump's administration wants to submit the agreement to the US Senate before 1 October.
In case the negotiations fail, Mexico's president-elect, Andres Manuel López Obrador, announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, injured in a knife attack, has left hospital.
The far-right ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro, where he lives, according to a report by the daily newspaper O Globo.
After his dismissal, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will make public appearances in the South American country during the last week before the presidential elections.
The politician was attacked in the early part of September during an election campaign rally in southern Brazil.
Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "Der nicht"), women's associations in particular had called for protests against the ex-military.
In the social networks, too, the associations against Bolsonaro's racist and contemptuous statements were mobile.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In the capital, Brasilia, the protests mixed with a rally by the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers' Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He replaced ex-president Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and was therefore not allowed to run.
The presidential election in Brazil is on 7 October.
An ex-mayor of the city of São Paulo, Haddad has so far been far behind the far-right candidate Bolsonaro in polls.
The "Trump of Brazil" has been involved in politics for a long time, but has recently presented himself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates reach an absolute majority in the first round of voting, there will be a run-off on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not succeed from this - no matter who he is up against.
Bolsonaro is known for his hatred of homosexuals and blacks and for glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Time and again, he is shocked by verbal defections.
Another time, he said that supporters of Lula's left-wing Workers' Party should be shot.
Europe reclaims Ryder Cup title
Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines - Just an hour from Disneyland, European golfers have written another Ryder Cup tale at the gates of Paris.
Captain Thomas Björn's outsider team dethroned favourite defending champion USA by a toothless Tiger Woods in front of more than 150,000 spectators on the three days at Le Golf National with great strokes and outstanding team spirit.
Died after a long illness: Danish rock legend
Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen told Larsen's website.
On his deathbed, Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician had been in treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen became well-known with the Gasolin band, which was hugely successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Their songs were influenced by international music greats such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the dissolution of the band in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold around three million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album "Midt om natten" is still the best-selling album in Denmark.
In a statement on Sunday, Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen praised Larsen as a "street boy" who was "against everything, but in all hearts."
The head of the government also recalled that the monarchy opponent Larsen had appeared at the 70th birthday of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark in 2010.
Rocknacht in the shoe factory: Volume at compressed air level
"Here we stand, take the bone saw and ignite a concert evening with the power of a tiger." Only the band names of "Here We Stand," "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" suggest such a description of the rock live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the civic centre Schuhfabrik: Pure hard rock by three bands who are not friends with one another.
After the sound check and just before the start of the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There is no sign of stage fright.
After that, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in conjunction with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands will delight the around 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika is able to convince at the beginning of the concert evening with the latest, unknown pieces of their own and the forthcoming CD.
In front of the stage, they dance to the vocal and powerful interplay of the band.
Although "encore" calls cannot be overheard, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leaves the stage to the trio "Here We Stand."
Guitarists Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher with their alternative, sometimes reminiscent of classical rock of the 1970s demonstrate that hard rock is not the same as hard rock.
After the "high energy rock" of the "Tigers," "Here We Stand" uses a synthesizer in addition to the guitar rock.
Not only the yearning, almost ballad-like "Take Me Home" impresses with the change from melodic passages to the guitar-heavy rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
However, the Tönnishäuschen quartet "The Ignition" has gained a special reputation since its foundation in 2005.
Full of agility, the band will be presenting their hard rock on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ignition" has special stage experience with its appearances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the tour in China in 2017 - is obvious and inaudible.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann, in collaboration with the band, also puts his own accents on the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
On the other hand, the guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a rejoiced solo, which runs through the audience, to the sound that feels even higher than before.
A certain volume is, of course, part of the genre for such a hard rock concert: The "Mint Mosquito" rock night, according to information from the mixing desk team, is around 98 decibels at the three-part concert of "Here We Stand," "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition."
This is, for example, at the level of compressed air chambers, but it is still well below the "Wacken-Fesitval" excerpts, which "The Ignition" refer to on their website.
However, the Ahlen audience does not need 120 decibels of noise from the nozzle, as is customary for the annual metal rendezvous in the north of the republic.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocking gait have long since convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso playing and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, have taken the bone saw and ignited a concert evening with the power of a tiger," all three groups can say in the end, though in a figurative sense.
And above all, enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

One dead in glider accident at Essen / Mülheim airport
A fatal accident occurred at the airport in Mülheim / Essen.
A glider crashed in a car park at Mülheim / Essen airport on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
A fatal accident occurred on Sunday near the Mülheim / Essen airport.
According to the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung," a glider had crashed on the parking lot at the airport.
The pilot was killed.
As the "WAZ" further reports, the flight student was on board alone - the plane is said to be a single-seater.
The plane was already on the approach at the time of the accident.
The crash site is just a short distance from a tent on the airport grounds.
But an Oktoberfest has been taking place since this weekend.
The airport Mülheim / Essen is located on the city limits of the two Ruhr cities and directly on the driveway to the motorway 52.
From the parking lot there is a Park & Ride offer at large events in the Essen Fair or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump lashes out at Kim: "And then we fell in love"
It is no secret that, despite the nuclear crisis, the US president is well-disposed towards North Korea's leader, Kim.
Now, however, Trump has made a veritable declaration of love for his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters."
At the tender age of 72, the married US president has declared himself a new flame.
The tragic thing is that it is a long-distance relationship.
In public on Saturday, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
In front of supporters in the US state of West Virginia, Trump has almost found tender words for the half-so-old scion of the ruling dynasty from Pyongyang, even though it is proving to be a tough chunk in the struggle for North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
"I was tough, he was tough, and things went back and forth between us," Trump said.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And it's not just the talks with Kim that have caused his heart to melt.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection has also borne political fruit: Trump referred to the halt of all nuclear and missile tests announced by Kim, even if critics see little more than lip service.
The US president seemed to be well aware that the affection for the "Rocket Man," Trump's nickname for Kim, is unlikely to be a secret to everyone.
In any case, he anticipated the expected criticism of it during his appearance in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they fell in love."
How terrible, how terrible is that?
It is so unpresidential.
But Trump said he cared little about it, and then pointed his finger at the crowd: "I've always told you it's so easy to be presidential."
But then there wouldn't be 10,000 people rushing into this crowded arena out there, we'd only have 200 people standing outside.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler Bestens visited, atmospheric and on top of that spoiled by sun: Very varied and with a good shot of Oktoberfest flair, Baesweiler's city centre cleaned up on Sunday.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest not only took place in the tent at the fire station, but was extended from the trade association on Sunday to the city.
Refugees rescued from Libyan prison thanks to video
Nigerian refugees have used a cell phone video to point out their catastrophic detention conditions in Libya, enabling them to be rescued.
The group had filmed the recording in their cell in the coastal town of Savija in July at the risk of their lives and circulated it online.
"They refuse to send us back," one man said in the video message.
We are suffering here, we are dying here.
The recording was sent to the France 24 Observers website, whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flown to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we would not have been able to return to Nigeria," Efe Onyeka, who recorded the video, told AFP news agency.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya while trying to reach Europe via the Mediterranean.
According to him, the video put him at risk of his life.
One of his comrades was beaten to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
In general, the prison conditions were catastrophic: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organises voluntary repatriation of refugees stranded in Libya.
Some 2,700 migrants from Nigeria have been sent back to their homes this year through the programme, said IOM spokesman in the West African country Jorge Galindo.
The case of the Nigerians who have now been rescued is not exceptional in view of the poor prison conditions in Libya.
However, he has not yet heard of a call for help via mobile phone video.
International organisations have long criticised the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps as undignified.
The North African state, dominated in large part by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on their way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the local elementary school on Sunday afternoon to prepare her classes for Monday, she surprised a burglar.
At around 16: 50, the teacher entered the building via the main entrance.
In the front house on the first floor, she saw a man fleeing immediately.
First through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there over a staircase to the ground floor or forecourt.
The teacher informed the police, who started the investigation.
It is not yet possible to say whether things or money were stolen.
Description of perpetrator: About 16 years old, black, very short hair, slightly darker appearance, dark trousers, dark T-shirt.
Please contact the Obernberg Police Inspectorate at the Inn, telephone number 059 133 4244.
German man trapped in his own car for days
A 75-year-old man had to stay in his car for several days and nights in a forest area in central Franconia after he stuck the car away from all forest roads and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescuers discovered the car by chance on Saturday afternoon near a pasture and freed those who had been missing since Tuesday evening, police announced on Sunday.
According to the information, the 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was in good health despite the cold nights and the long period without supplies.
He said he is now looking forward to his home.
The pensioner was reported missing by his family after he did not return from driving his 4x4 across the local meadows and fields on Tuesday.
Despite intensive search efforts, the man's whereabouts remained unclear for days.
Laschet urges the rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) has called for the rule of law in Turkey in talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to his own statements.
Relations between the two countries are currently "overshadowed," Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne airport.
This mainly concerns waves of arrests, freedom of the press and freedom of religion.
He has therefore "made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalise in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this."
According to his own information, Laschet also addressed the cases of Germans in prison in Turkey.
He expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
As a result, Erdogan has again stressed the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan was briefly moved to a Federal Ministry of Defence building at Cologne Airport.
Originally, it was supposed to take place in the castle of Wahn - but the owners of the castle had refused to do so out of political conviction against Erdogan.
After the discussion, Erdogan travelled on to the opening of the Ditib mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said: "The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their point of contact - not the Turkish president.
Lack of trust in the USA: North Korea calls for disarmament
While U.S. President Trump is not tired of emphasizing the successes in negotiating the denuclearization of North Korea, the East Asian regime is more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for Washington to be accommodated.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has accused the US government at the UN General Debate of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula with its continuing sanctions.
"The latest standoff comes because the U.S. is relying on coercive measures that are lethal for building trust," Ri said in New York.
In these circumstances, disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea.
"Without any trust in the USA, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances there is no way that we will be the first to disarm ourselves," said the North Korean chief diplomat.
That punitive measures could "bring North Korea to its knees" is "a dream dream of people who do not know us."
However, in order to build trust, his country has stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri stressed.
However, there were no "appropriate reactions" from the US side, the minister criticised.
Last year alone, the UN Security Council adopted sanctions against the internationally isolated country three times over North Korea's nuclear and missile programme.
Us President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have been pushing for strict compliance with the sanctions at the United Nations in recent days.
At the same time, the US government is working on a rapprochement.
In June, Trump met North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un for the first time.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US president is seeking a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is scheduled to return to Pyongyang for talks on ending North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the community
The fact that they were actually in a youth meeting was not helped by the many visitors to the HoT open house: White blankets and flower ornaments on the tables and a large buffet waited for guests after the harvest service.
The young people of the HoT had conjured up the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank with their food.
The start was not exactly easy with the new facility, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, remembers.
We had already filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were perfectly prepared for the big day.
But then, on the first day after the summer break, the bad surprise came: A power outage had knocked out the huge two-piece refrigerator, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start again: Although we received a lot of support from friends and neighbours, the children and young people wanted to do it on their own," says Westbuer.
And so everyone got on with it.
The result was impressive, the guests were delighted.
"Chefs can't do better," praised a visitor impressed, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were allowed to use quiche, liver cheese or cake.
"It is really great what the children and young people have done," stressed Pastor Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen was astonished by card tricks and other tricks.
Jürgen Sator leaves the NRW board of directors of the panel
The head of the Essen-based panel, Jörg Sartor, has resigned from his post in the national association out of frustration at criticism from his own ranks.
Sartor had become known throughout Germany because the Essen Table had introduced an admission ban for foreigners.
He had already resigned as vice-president of the NRW boards in July, said Sartor of Welt am Sonntag.
There are too many of them in my back.
The head of the NRW board association, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed to the dpa his understanding for the decision of his long-standing deputy.
Sartor took the sharp criticism with him.
"I can understand his step - it was expressed by people who didn't know exactly why the Essen table was doing this."
However, Sartor is still active for the Essen table - "six days a week, nothing changes," says Weilerswist.
In "Welt am Sonntag," Sartor again criticized colleagues from other panels.
The approach should not be taken, "without us the people in the city will starve."
It was up to the state to ensure that people did not die of starvation.
The Essen resident did not attend a conference of the panels in Berlin on Friday.
"I'm being told too much sweet shmus," he said.
There are all these social fuzzis who also criticised me at the time.
SF Lorch lose 2: 0 lead - Gmünder Tagespost
Football, Landesliga Lorch loses 2: 3 against newcomers - TV Heuchlingen wins in Kirchheim after a gap - Bettringen beats Lauchheim.
With 2: 0 Lorch was already in the lead in the home match against the TV newcomer - in the end it was 2: 3 and the disappointment among the sports fans was great.
Completely different from the TV Heuchlingen: In Kirchheim, the TVH quickly fell behind with 0: 1, but won with 2: 1 after 90 minutes. Meanwhile, at the top of the table, the SGB were able to win with a 3: 0
Gladbach squandered two-time lead - Schalke without Embolo with first win
Borussia Mönchengladbach will have to wait for an away win in Wolfsburg.
In 2: 2, the foals play a lead twice.
Schalke come to the first win of the season against Mainz (1: 0).
(SDA) Schalke manoeuvred four times in the first five league games with early goals.
Now Domenico Tedesco's team has demonstrated once again the strength with which they finished first behind Bayern last season.
Alessandro Schöpf headed home the equaliser in the eleventh minute after strong preparatory work by Evgeni Konoplyanka, and the hosts subsequently preserved the mini-cushion with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund are greeting from the top of the Bundesliga.
Lucien Favre's team had trailed 0-2 at the break against Bayer Leverkusen, but came to a 4-2 victory in the second half.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65th) and Marco Reus (69th) equalised with a double in four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63rd minute, added another double in the closing stages (86th / 94th) to crown the performance after the break.
VfB Stuttgart also came to the first victory.
Against Werder Bremen, who had already been decimated by a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic before the break, Stuttgart's fans had to be anxious in the meantime.
Borna Sosa and inattentive goalie Ron-Robert Zieler produced a curious own goal, which helped the visitors equalise in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later Gonzalo Castro led VfB to their first victory.
In Wolfsburg Michael Lang did not experience a completely successful, but also not a failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbach players, joined by the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang, twice lost a lead, ultimately played 2: 2 and have been waiting for an away win in the VW city since 2003.
Renato Steffen, with his second league goal, was responsible for Wolfsburg's 1-1 equaliser.
Yann Sommer was powerless in the flat shot from 20 metres of the Aargau, as well as in the second goal after an hour.
Nevertheless, the tendencies in Gladbach are quite promising.
Alassane Pléa turns out to be a goalgetter in the storm of foals.
Against Wolfsburg, the French record purchase from OGC Nice came for the third time in a row and for the seventh time in the seventh match.
After seven laps, Gladbach is in fourth place.
Within 40 minutes, the previously unbeaten Werder Bremen was in an uncomfortable position against VfB Stuttgart.
After 19 minutes, Florian Kohlfeldt's team was taken by surprise by a Stuttgart keeper, the ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis, who scored his first goal of the season, and after 36 minutes Milos Veljkovic continued to put his team ahead: The 23-year-old Serbian scored a yellow-card winner against Daniel Didavi.
Although Stuttgart's defenders Borna Sosa and goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Bremen players back into the game through a curious own goal (68.), a quarter of an hour before the end Gonzalo Castro shot the Stuttgart players, who were acting in abundance, back on the road to victory.
Nuremberg won the duel against Düsseldorf 3: 0.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens had already put the home team on course by means of a foulpenalty.
Macedonians vote on new name
In Macedonia today, around 1.8 million citizens are voting on whether to change their country's name in Northern Macedonia.
If the answer is yes, the nearly three-decade-long conflict with its neighbour Greece could be resolved.
Athens had insisted on a name change because of its northern province of the same name and had blocked any rapprochement between Macedonia and the West.
Voters will therefore also decide on future western integration.
The USA had announced that the country could quickly become a NATO member in the event of a positive outcome of the referendum.
Syrians in detention.
The refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian brutally beat three retirees and injured some of them.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker had rioted in the flight lane in Alsergrund at around 10pm on Friday.
When the policemen arrived, they addressed the accused, who walked up to passers-by with clenched fists and tried to attack them, to his behaviour.
As a result, the Syrian tried to beat and kick the officers.
Shortly after, it emerged that the suspect had knocked three elderly ladies (65, 67, 75) to the ground with his fists at a tram stop in Währinger Strasse a short time earlier.
He also trampled the trio on his feet.
Some of the pensioners were seriously injured.
They suffered haematomas, bruises and concussions.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured "out of an unknown cause," as the police said.
He was taken to hospital and monitored throughout the treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs has married his long-term friend Christoph Rohde.
The two met in Hamburg on Saturday.
A registered civil partnership was out of the question for her, Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper.
"If we get married, that's right." He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the budgetary spokesman for the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokesmen for the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
On 30 June 2017, Kahrs caused a stir in the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals.
For example, he had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stumbled" on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said, alluding to the accidental announcement of the opening of the GDR border by Günter Schabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their civil partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the adoption law.
Garden day: 400 metres hedge cut
There was a lot of work in front of the members of the children's association Kinderhaus and the leprosy society.
After all, around 400 metres of hedge around the gardens of the residents of the Pfründnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the residents, it went to work for around twelve supporters.
"We are doing this in order to reduce costs," declared Walter Schröer, president of the citizens' association.
And so much has accumulated.
Due to the hot summer, we're late this time, but luckily it's just a form cut.
Because the hedge had already been shaved in the spring.
Breakfast, always following the work, also has a long tradition.
"Everyone should stay with us," said Walter Schröer.
World Championship in Rio: Hannes Aigner takes gold at the Canoe Slalom World Championship
Augsburg's Hannes Aigner won the gold medal at the end of the canoe slalom world championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old made a perfect run on the Olympic track on Sunday.
Two years ago, he missed the Olympic bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well prepared, had enough rides here on the track and everything was right today, "said the London 2012 Olympic third.
At the finish, he threw his paddle away with joy and raised both arms with certainty - knowing that it would be enough for at least one medal.
After all, he had start number four.
But the six remaining starters could not topple his fabled time of 89.69 seconds.
The second was the Czech Jiri Prskavec in front of the Russian Pawel Eigel.
Gauting Police Inspectorate reports the first attempted burglary this autumn in a detached house.
Luckily, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - this is what burglars want to take advantage of.
Yesterday, the Gauting Police Inspectorate reported the first attempted burglary this autumn.
It is thanks to the alarm system that the attempt at the detached house on Königswieser Strasse has failed.
It started when the perpetrators put their hands up just before 8pm on Friday.
The burglars did suspect that the residents were not at home.
However, the alarm system apparently surprised them to such an extent that they managed to escape without loot.

Hertha bust: Caught up in reality: Bayern to face Ajax
The predicate is unbeatable: The defeat in Berlin "does not want to please" FC Bayern.
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interlude for the tenure of Niko Kovac.
The first small performance under the new coach, Niko Kovac, is by no means intended to increase the Munich team to a greater autumnal low.
"A week ago, you had the impression that we were invincible.
Now the reality has caught up with us, "said Thomas Müller after the deserved 0-2 defeat at Hertha BSC and demanded a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us knows that this really annoys us and that is why we are heading for Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year, not scoring an own goal, as at the same time in the pre-season two mandatory games in a series without victory, the league leaders in the Bundesliga for the time being lost to Borussia Dortmund.
While the overall situation is far from as dramatic as the final stage of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record-holder must be warned.
FC Augsburg at 1: 1, with its lukewarm man-against-man tactics, and the Berliners through their playful needle-sticks over the outside, have delivered two blueprints within three days, just as the most recently overpowering Bayern are to be knocked out.
"Those who know FC Bayern know that we will not let this happen to us and we will do everything we can to ensure that we are successful again," stressed Kovac.
Other than that, however, he dealt with his losers in his hometown surprisingly gently and merely blamed his first defeat as Munich coach on the once again poor handling of chances.
A win against Amsterdam and Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday, before the international break, would nevertheless make the first interlude of his tenure a positive one - otherwise the tone is likely to sharpen.
Kovac, for example, did not take any extraordinary measures before this season's second top-flight appearance after the 2-0 win over Benfica in Lisbon.
After the day off on Sunday, the short preparation for the second round match against Ajax, which AEK Athens also conquered with 3: 0, will begin as planned.
"Now it has caught us in two games, but we will also score again," announced national team captain Manuel Neuer.
As after the losing cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place, Joshua Kimmich spoke plainly.
The legal defender appeared in the role of Mahner.
"I don't think it's all bad luck, we have to work it out again, because we don't make the multitude of chances and make the mistakes at the back," the 23-year-old stressed shortly before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, Bayern were already five points behind Dortmund, which has now regained the lead with a one-point lead.
And so, with a twinkle in the eye, Kimmich at least regarded positively that the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has now come to an end.
"Yes, it's good," said the national player.
It's good for the league.
DFB boss in the firing line: Özil-Causa: Sharp attack by Erdogan on Grindel
Turkish President Erdogan denounces the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany with serious accusations.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the association line.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - On different stages, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the power of interpretation in the long-running dispute over Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish president strongly criticised the handling of the ex-world champion in Germany at the opening of the large Ditib mosque in Cologne, the DFB head defended the association line.
Early on Sunday morning, Grindel, who had been attacked by Özil personally, announced the consequences of the causa in the ZDF "sports studio" in Mainz.
"In the future - because we also have a lot of players with a migration background in the U-teams - we have to draw very precise conclusions that this kind of thing does not happen again," said the 57-year-old, who wants to win a national player without a migration background as another integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel reiterated that Erdogan does not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
He had strongly denounced racism towards Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our German born and raised Mesut Özil and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this society because they took pictures with me in England, "Erdogan said on Saturday in the cathedral city.
Frankly, as their president, I could not digest the fact that our two young men, who went on to the German national team, were marginalised.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that, in contrast to Özil, he felt "sensibly treated by the DFB" following the World Cup affair, which started with photographs of the two of them with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced his intention to face players in the future.
Someone says: If I win, I'm German, if I lose, I'm a migrant - it's not possible.
"I very much regret the fact that he has such an impression," Grindel said.
We should have defended Mesut more, as I have always said.
But he does not see a basis for Özil's return to the national team.
As a consequence, an additional integration officer will now be appointed, alongside the native Brazilian, Cacau, and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone has a clear impact on society and football without a migration background and says:" The issue is important, we have to take care of it, "it would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground, where integration must work," said Grindel.
Despite the criticism of his person following the World Cup exit and the Özil affair, he intends to run again for office as DFB president next year.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as I can," Grindel said.
Year-old builds three accidents in three hours
Coburg / Rödental - As the police report, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.
Initially, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red light in the Lauterer Höhe area.
She told the pensioner that he had driven against her car.
But there was no exchange of people, because the 75-year-old could not find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, the police received a telephone message about a motorist who had got off the road and was driving against a traffic light.
When approached, the man did not want police on the scene and then drove away.
After that, the Rödentaler drove home.
However, the pensioner proceeded in his home, where he has lived for decades, and rammed a construction vehicle when turning.
Eventually, the police were able to find him and stop him.
His car suffered significant damage in the accident.
The 75-year-old made a confused impression and could not remember much more.
The damage is around 1300 Euros.
Moor fire in Meppen: Almost 1000 emergency personnel are still on duty.
Around four weeks after the outbreak of the moor fire on a German military base in Emsland, 980 emergency personnel are still engaged in the extinguishing work.
The Bundeswehr announced this on Sunday.
According to a spokesman, as the situation continues to develop in a stable manner, 70 volunteers have recently been removed.
A further reduction in the number of emergency personnel is planned, it said.
An above-ground fire was discovered and extinguished during the night of Sunday.
Last week, the disaster was cancelled, which was declared on 21 September, just over a week earlier, because of fears that the flames were putting adjacent forests and settlements at risk due to wind and sparks.
On Thursday, it was said that the spread of the fire to adjacent communities was no longer threatened.
At times, more than 1500 emergency personnel on the ground tried to control the large-scale fire.
The Air Force continues to support the work at the German military test site near Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with Bundeswehr drones.
According to the Bundeswehr, reconnaissance flights with "tornadoes" are also planned for October 2 and 5.
The fire was caused by test missiles fired by Airbus technicians.
The smoke flag of the Moorbrand had at times been drawn up to a hundred kilometres far across northwestern Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr wants to set up a point of contact to receive reports of damage.
Initial claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Catherine in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, the politician has married his longtime friend in Hamburg.
The two have been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Nearly one year after the entry into force of marriage for all, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs has married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
The two met in Hamburg on Saturday.
A registered civil partnership was out of the question for her, Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper.
If we get married, that's right.
He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the budgetary spokesman for the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokesmen for the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
On 30 June 2017, Kahrs caused a stir in the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals.
For example, he had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stumbled" on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said, alluding to the accidental announcement of the opening of the GDR border by Günter Schabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their civil partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the adoption law.
Referendum started in Macedonia on new state name
In Macedonia, the highly anticipated referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Around 1.8 million voters are to decide whether their state should be called Northern Macedonia in the future.
Its neighbour Greece insists on this because of its northern province of the same name.
For almost three decades, Athens had blocked any rapprochement between Skopje and the EU and NATO.
If the citizens vote in favour, they will also give the starting signal for the western integration of their country.
Elie Wiesel - The Author Who Saves the Shoah from Forgetting
Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel would have turned 90 on 30 September.
The Nobel Peace Prize winner from 1986 died in the USA in 2016, leaving behind a work that conserves the horror of the Shoah for posterity.
Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register should facilitate organ donation and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can still only be removed with explicit consent, stresses Swisstransplant.
(Dpa) Switzerland will launch an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This should facilitate organ donation and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your requests will then be available from Swisstransplant if required.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may continue to be removed - as in Germany - only with explicit consent, stresses Swisstransplant.
It is assumed that 15 percent of Swiss people have a donor card, says Franz Immer, director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of cases will a card be found at the crucial moment among potential donors.
In over 60 percent of the conversations, the relatives do not know the wish of the deceased.
"They then have to decide on behalf of the deceased, which is often very burdensome," says Immer.
There is already a similar registration system in Great Britain.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information on possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokeswoman of the Federal Centre for Health Education, Marita Völker-Albert, says.
"There is no register where people can register their wishes - pro or against organ donation," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has called for a new regulation of organ donation.
Under his proposal, everyone would initially be considered an organ donor, unless he or her family disagrees.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old schoolboy is world champion in head computing
The 14-year-old schoolboy Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is the world champion in head computing.
He prevailed in Wolfsburg at the weekend against 39 fellow fighters.
This was announced on Sunday by Martina Flamme-Jasper from the Phaeno Science Museum, the venue for the competition.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany took third place.
The youngest World Cup participant was a twelve-year-old Japanese schoolboy, the oldest a 74-year-old retiree from France, said chief referee Ralf Laue.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organises the competition every two years.
For example: 14.130 214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
As spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, where attendees were competing against guests from the audience with calculators.
Wenzel Grüß from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air when calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries attempted to qualify for the competition.
Grüß was there two years ago in Bielefeld as a 14-year-old.
Organisers can do little with terms such as superbrain, genius or child prodigy.
"Head computing can be trained," he said.
Many participants practised several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, even in stadiums, there are organized computational competitions.
For example, the six-digit square root pulling is one of the disciplines.
The candidates are given surprise tasks for which they must quickly find a solution strategy.
The Germans also had good chances here, said the chief referee.
Otherwise, Asians are often in an advantage, because they learn how to calculate the head more intensively and with other, effective methods in early childhood.
Urgent appeal: Video with naked Serena Williams: Breast cancer screening
Tennis ace Serena Williams shows her emotive and sensitive side.
With this video, the 37-year-old wants to draw attention to breast cancer and push for early detection.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings on top without the song "I Touch Myself" from the group "The Divinyls" - only her hands cover her most intimate places.
Singer Chrissy Amphlett has died.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project, which is about early breast cancer detection that can save lives.
Serena Williams herself would have died almost a year ago.
There were complications in the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia.
Emergency surgery has been launched to save the baby's life.
A subsequent CT scan revealed clumps of blood in Serena's lungs.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The German government is planning a significant expansion of the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the turquoise-blue coalition will send a draft law on the so-called "symbols law" to be reviewed.
The aim is to significantly expand the number of terrorist groups or similar groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings fresh snow on the mountains in the west
Ms Holle is shaking her beds for the first time in the West next week: Polar cold air reaches Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to meteorologists from the Central Institute of Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit drops to between 1,500 and 1,200 metres at the start of the week - in narrow valleys it can snow down to around 1,000 metres at a high intensity, it said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern, above 2,000 metres, 20 to 40 centimetres of fresh snow is to be expected.
On higher-altitude mountain passes (Arlberg Pass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstrasse), the road conditions become wintry.
Farmers to start annual buckling on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers will be allowed to start their annual crackdown on Monday.
The "green walls" unique in Germany have shaped the landscape of the low-forest federal state for around 200 years.
The tree and shrub hedges, which are up to five metres wide, are a "forest substitute" and are the last retreats for many animals and plants.
As corridors, Knicks connect nearby habitats over which the exchange of organisms can still function, as Ingo Ludwichowski, the executive director of the Conservation Society of Germany (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, said.
Knicks Are Living Fences
The Knicks were created on the orders of the Danish King Christian VI in 1766, who ruled Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field boundaries and cattle fences, they also provided the farmers with firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.
His name "Knick" dates back to that time: By "bending over" the branches, the dense, intertwined delimitations were able to develop.
Today, around 45,000 kilometres of hedgerows stretch between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, giving the impression of a woodland-rich, multi-layered landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used by around 7,000 species as a substitute habitat.
Up to 1800 different species could live in one kilometre and up to 30 pairs of birds could breed.
However, the kink can only fulfil its ecologically important function if it is taken care of appropriately in winter.
Otherwise, it will wither away into a light row of trees, which, in addition to biodiversity, will also lose the windscreen effect, Ludwichowski said.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, kink care can only be carried out outside the breeding period from October to March.
After the tsunami in Sulawesi, Indonesians talk about the situation on the ground
The local Radika Pinto describes in an interview with the German Network of Editors (RND) the situation on the ground on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and tsunami:
Were you there during the tsunami?
No, I was in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes happened, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I found out about the tsunami, I immediately went back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight because the airport on Palu was closed at the time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that relief supplies can be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all completely destroyed.
Our "World Vision" office has also been destroyed, but we have provisionally set up something where we have also accommodated other people.
Where are the people living in Sulawesi now?
Many have run onto surrounding hills, where they still hang out for fear of another tsunami and earthquake, and where they have no access to water and food.
Some are staying in front of their homes, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and gas stations are completely closed, people sometimes steal food and gasoline.
The civil service is completely shut down, the national government is helping out.
A prison has also been destroyed, the inmates are in some cases running around freely and the search for them is difficult.
Many bodies are still lying around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How does the communication and information supply work on the island?
At the moment we have mobile phone reception, but before that it did not work and we only got information over the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people who they do not know if they live and where they are because people were not at home during the earthquakes, but for example on the road to work.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have any information?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many people thought "Okay, not a tsunami" - and then it came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was a misinformation that a tsunami hit the region and they ran onto the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi, which lies on the Pacific Ring of Fire, not prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how to react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.
Muscle injury to Werder: VfB must do without Aogo and Donis for a long time
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will miss VfB Stuttgart for a long time with serious muscle injuries.
Aogo suffered a muscle fiber fracture in the back of his left thigh during the 2: 1 win against Werder Bremen on Saturday, the Football League announced on Sunday.
In Donis, doctors diagnosed a muscle tear in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss games after the following international break.
VfB Stuttgart did not give a forecast for downtime.
A muscle tear usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fiber tear usually heals a little faster.
Triumph of Hyperrealism at the San Sebástian Film Festival
San Sebastián - With the San Sebastián Film Festival, the ranks of the most prestigious European festivals close every year.
Despite all the chants on the cinema, it can be summed up: 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.
After a convincing competition in Cannes, especially with strong contributions from Europe and Asia, and a Venice that attracted a lot of attention with Hollywood Oscar nominees, San Sebastian also delivered one of its best contests in recent years.
On Sunday morning, the Olching Fire Department attempted to capture an injured duck.
However, the action dragged on for some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - On Sunday morning, a white, injured duck fell to walkers on Olching Lake.
She was in the area of the water station.
To help the animal, passers-by called the police and fire service.
However, the first attempts to catch the duck went wrong.
Despite the injury, she was able to avoid the emergency services again and again.
In the end, she fled to the lake.
With a lifeboat, the fire brigade was able to circle the animal and push it back to shore, where it was then put into a transport crate after almost an hour by a firefighter with a hearty grip.
The duck, which was injured on the chest, was then taken to the LMU veterinary clinic in Oberschleißheim.
But, according to initial assessments, their chances of survival are rather slim.
Biathlete Julian Eberhard claims World Cup medal
Biathlete Julian Eberhard was in fourth place at Olympia for a long time.
Next winter, the Saalfelden wants to make up for the missing precious metal at the World Championship in Östersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old a close medal in the Pyeongchang Olympic sprint.
In the end, seven-tenths of a second was missing on bronze.
"I've consciously left myself time to process it," Eberhard said at the opening of the MYGYM gym in his hometown of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top form, but I just didn't want to be.
The Pinzgau is all the more motivated to catch up with the missing precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to get back into shape for a major event, to win something.
At some point, you have to strike.
The world championship track in Östersund (SWE) is Eberhard: "I have already closed the track to the heart," he remembers with pleasure his fourth World Cup place in the individual race in the previous year.
Immediately after the Olympic Games, he celebrated the only individual victory for Austria in the last World Cup winter in the Kontiolahti (FIN) competition.
With the relay, he finished second in Oslo (NOR).
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation at a turbo pace
Time is extremely short and the number of planned hearings is very limited.
With a turbo-charged FBI investigation, Republicans in the U.S. Senate want to secure a slim majority for controversial judge nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has been charged with coercion.
President Donald Trump has set a deadline of Friday for investigators to shed light on more than 30 years of alleged incidents.
The latest turn in the drama surrounding Kavanaugh's appeal, which was accompanied by a culture struggle, was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing by Kavanaugh and first-time prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, during which the jurist unleashed angry tirades against the opposition Democrats, the Senate Judiciary Committee should clear the way for the final confirmation of the arch-conservative judge on the U.S. Supreme Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed assured when Senator Jeff Flake suddenly declared, contrary to his original announcement, that he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who on Thursday referred to the severe allegations as "scaremongering," initially refrained from further attacking the women and instead spoke of "happiness in misfortune."
In this way, final doubts could be dispelled, he said.
Later, at an election rally, Trump harshly attacked the Democrats for rejecting Kavanaugh: "They're trying to block and destroy."
Trump orders FBI investigation into Kavanaugh case
The White House has also extremely limited the powers of the investigators.
The well-known accusations of two women will be investigated, no longer, a government official told the Wall Street Journal: "They are not going on a fishing trip."
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
The mobile radar of the municipality of Ried, installed in a "civil vehicle" to monitor the speed limit, will be stationed on Gartenstrasse from Monday 1 October, according to the municipality.
The Federal School Centre is also located there.
The municipality also operates several fixed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: You felt the fear
Coach Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first win of the season against Mainz.
The relief for Schalke after the first win of the season is great.
Nevertheless, time also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - In the meantime, it is well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches.
That was no different in the home match against Mainz 05.
"I saw every ball in it.
And there were a lot of corners and a lot of balls in our penalty area, "said Schalke 04's sporting director - and breathed.
After all, the Kings had still managed to get the narrow 1-0 win against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first win of the season under control.
In fact, things could have been different.
After the lead by Alessandro Schöpf 11 had given the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco certainty Tedesco: "Overall, the first half was good, both playfully and from the pressing point of view," with increasing playing time, obviously more and more the head played a role.
Schöpf is not really a headball monster.
"The last ten minutes felt like two hours for me," said Heidel, "If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to put it out of their hands, and so they retreated.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three points of the season.
"We have all fallen a huge stone from the heart," said Schöpf, who had no insignificant part in this with his header: "I am actually the worst head-ball player in man-making."
But in the end, only victory counts.
The relief was palpable throughout the arena, including, of course, Tedesco.
"We wanted to start at full strength in the early stages and turn it into fireworks," said Schalke's head coach.
Victory was important.
Finally, we can look forward to a few hours.
I'm very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We played intelligently, calmly and boldly, so we have to tackle games over 90 minutes.
Probably the biggest shortcoming of the afternoon: Königsblau missed it, rather to worry for clearer conditions.
The possibilities were finally there, for example through the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who hit the bar twice: 59. / 72. Or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have been a treble," said Tedesco: "You've already felt the fear a bit."
So I'm glad we won.
Thus, he was not the only switcher.
Fischbachau: Column of smoke visible for 2 km in Leitzachtal
The smoke was not to be overlooked.
A hiker from around two kilometres away observed a fire in the Leitzachtal valley at around 1.30pm on Sunday.
Now the police are investigating.
Fischbachau - Police and fire brigade soon found out the cause: An unknown man had set fire to rubbish on a two-square-metre area on Gschwendner Berg.
According to police, it appeared that he had been monitoring the fire for a long time, but then left the blaze unattended.
And that near the forest.
Thirty Fischbach firefighters were busy pulling apart and extinguishing.
Police are now investigating for arson.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion on an equal footing
In front of them is the author, Professor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has again accepted the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have made it my mission to bring interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfeld Treff" - the association that cooperates with the "Kulturpolitik" alliance in organising the evening.
El-Mafaalani gets into the reading very easily, describes the process of writing the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject in a comprehensible way.
With a lot of gestures, solid numbers and one or the other joke, he brings the listeners closer to one of the most conflicting themes: Migration and integration.
Why do conflicts arise in spite of successful integration?
The Syrian author uses a metaphor to answer the question.
At one table sits the German society, at the cat table the migrants of the first generation.
Their children are growing up in Germany and want to come to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to have a say.
This leads to conflict.
The decisive factor is therefore not whether one classifies oneself politically on the right or on the left, but rather: "Am I for or against an open society?" He stresses.
At the beginning, the discussion starts rather slowly, then more and more lively.
And there is a need for speech.
An Afghan refugee recounts from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration with pupils.
El-Mafaalani stands in front, not on stage, a symbol of the discussion: It is on an equal footing.
The sociology professor does not impose his opinion, emphasizing that he speaks of the average, not of individual destinies.
He is pleased that there is interest in the issue, because "only when we understand what the problem is can we find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
Even during the subsequent signing, he still has an open ear for the questions of the guests, and in the foyer, in the case of prepared Kurdish specialities, there was an intense discussion.
Basketball: Bonn and Gießen win inaugural games
The Giessen 46ers and Telekom Baskets Bonn have ended the first day of the Basketball Bundesliga (BBL) with a home and away victory.
Giessen prevailed in a hard-fought match in its own hall with 91: 84 (43: 46) against Central German BC.
The ambitious Bonn-based team won the BG Göttingen with 86: 79 (49: 47).
The season's first leader is Alba Berlin after Saturday's 112: 55 gala against Science City Jena.
The German champions Bayern Munich and the former series champion Brose Bamberg had much more trouble at the start of the new season.
Munich already struggled on Friday to win 83: 77 at ratiopharm Ulm, Bamberg won the Frankenderby on Saturday at 84: 80 with Oliver Würzburg.
Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The demand is obviously huge: More than 100 interested parties have applied to buy one of the land in Landsham-South.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first land in the new development area Landsham-South on the open market.
This is what Mayor Roland Frick says.
In addition, the application phase for the 20 plots of land that the municipality offers at cheaper terms and prices - similar to the former model of local residents.
According to Frick, a good 100 applications have been received.
"The documents are currently being examined," regarding the application criteria, completeness and accuracy.
According to the mayor of Plieningen, the aim is to have prepared the candidate rankings for the 20 plots by the end of the year and to submit them to the municipal council.
After that, the award could take place.
A total of 50 plots of land for single and semi-detached houses will be created on the area in the south of Landsham, as well as four areas for multi-dwelling houses, each with a probable eight dwelling units.
The development has now been almost completed, and the roads and roads will soon be paved.
A single plot as well as two of the apartment buildings belong to one private person, the rest of the community of Pliening.
It sells the majority on the open market, 20 properties in a socially responsible model.
According to Frick, the two apartment buildings in the municipality are to be built as affordable housing.
With a total of 16 income-oriented dwellings supported by the state.
Space for 200 people
Roughly estimated on the area of the new building area Landsham-South, housing for about 200 people is created.
Not only that: Now, at the beginning of October, according to Frick, the start will be made there for the construction of a new nursery school.
It will house three kindergarten and three crib groups, as well as a multi-purpose room.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, at the start of the next kindergarten year.
Schalke's Naldo "great sport" succeeds on the bench
Not in the starting line-up for the third time in a row: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues sat on the bench for the third time in a row, not in the starting line-up of Schalker, but on the interchange bench, the understanding of many people would have been great if the Brazilian, who is almost two metres tall, had really spoken of his soul with frustration.
But when the Schalker players gathered in the centre circle as usual after the 1-0 win over FSV Mainz 05 and head coach Domenico Tedesco thanked all his professionals, the 36-year-old, whom everyone calls Naldo for the sake of simplicity, turned himself in and said: "We have to thank you, coach!"
"It was very emotional, it was a great sport," Tedesco later said of the reaction of his vice-captain, who despite his new reservists existence had no resentment.
Naldo, who was hailed last season as the best switch-maker, knows that he did not actually get on the sidelines with his coach - but is given a break for good reason.
One reason is called "load control."
It was not easy to tell him that.
"It wasn't easy to tell him, I'll tell you honestly," Tedesco said of the moment he told Naldo he wasn't in the starting line-up.
He is an important player, he is an important person.
But it's always about the cause, it's about the club, "Tedesco explained the move.
Naldo played 90 minutes against Bayern and Porto.
He is 36 years old.
It is important that everyone can have a go at the moment.
And that we all stay in the boat, "Tedesco explained the rotation, which has also recently caught Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: By also proving himself an exemplary team player on the bench.
In August, the mood in Austria's industry continued its downward trajectory in comparison to the Eurozone.
The purchasing managers' index (PMI) was at a 37-month low of 46.7 points.
Nevertheless, Austria has the third-best mood in Europe behind Ireland and the Netherlands, announced the Markit Institute on Monday on its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the euro zone PMI rose 1.1 points to 45.1 points, but the index remains below the 50-count mark for the 13th month in a row, indicating growth.
Only Ireland's industry cracked the threshold in August, scoring 50.9 points.
The Greeks were in the final light (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the scoreboard fell, but at a slower pace than in the previous months.
In Spain, the index reached its highest level since March with 44.0 points.
"The slightly attenuated drop may mean that the worst is over," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
But the industry remains the number one brake on growth in the third quarter.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: Export orders in the eurozone fell as much as they had not fallen since November 2011.
The companies therefore cut jobs for the seventh month in a row.
Industrial production in China also fell more sharply in August than initially thought.
The scoreboard fell from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The purchasing managers' index bases its figures on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Among other things, the data is collected on developments in turnover, employment, warehouses and prices.
Tuchel's PSG team manage eighth win in eighth league match
29 September 2018 at 19: 45
Nice coach Thomas Tuchel continues his journey from victory to victory with Paris Saint-Germain in France's Football Championship.
At OGC Nice, the defending champion won with 3: 0 (1: 0) thanks to two goals from superstar Neymar and was thus also successful in the eighth league match.
Most recently, Olympique Lyon made such a good start to the season in France 82 years ago.
The Brazilian Neymar put PSG in the lead after 22 minutes and produced the final score in the aftermath of the game.
Christopher Nkunku (46.) provided the interim 2: 0.
Paris thus also managed to rehearse the groundbreaking second Champions League group game against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
At the start of the Champions League, Tuchel's team suffered the only defeat so far this season in the 2: 3 in Liverpool.
