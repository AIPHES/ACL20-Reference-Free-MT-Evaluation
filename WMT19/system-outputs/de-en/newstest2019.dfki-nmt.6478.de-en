In the afternoon, another surprise awaits our candidates: they will not contest the romantic candlelight shoot before the My Solaris on their own, but alongside male model Fabian!
Hvar - flirting, flirting, seducing - no easy task for our girls.
Especially when a friend is waiting in Germany.
Nevertheless, the nine "beautiful Munich" candidates deliver in the shooting with people photographer Tuan and defy wind, spray and rain like real professionals.
The romantic shooting can be seen in the video:
DFB chief Grindel sees no basis for Özil comeback
Berlin DFB president Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for Mesut Özil's return to the national team.
"this is a question that, of course, depends on the fact that you get into the conversation, that you also talk to him about why he apparently felt one thing or another as laid down in his statement," Grindel said in the football podcast "Phrasenmäher" of the "Bild-Zeitung."
Despite months of debate over Özil's photos with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of 92-time national Özil.
"I would have been delighted if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed at some point that this would be the case, "Grindel said.
The 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and also justified it on the grounds that Grindel had not defended him against racist hostility during the World Cup.
The head of the DFB reiterated his criticism of Özil that he was not prepared to speak to federal coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to build up any pressure, but he knows it from football in such a way that if "you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I think it's a shame that this conversation has not been done so far."
Linz: garden hut in Schrebergartensiedlung burned down
At 2.13pm, the Linz fire brigade was alerted to a fire in the angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line runs directly across the allotment settlement, danger was in arrears.
The fire brigade stepped out and found the hut on full fire when it arrived.
The roof had to be removed practically in its entirety and fire debris had to be removed to the extent that was absolutely necessary.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had a battery for charging at lunchtime.
This could possibly be the cause of the fire.
In any case, according to the fire brigade, the charger was in the range of the highest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire has yet to be determined, as has the cause of the fire.
However, it is likely to be considerable, because the owner had a lot of collectibles in his garden hut.
Angry mother defends herself: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on Open Street
What drove Lindsay Lohan to this very strange action?
She apparently wanted to snatch the children from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: fully Loaded") has streamed live herself, apparently trying to snatch the children from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial transcript of the stream.
Here you see "luckily kissed" with Lindsay Lohan
The clip shows Lohan getting out of a van and going to a possibly homeless family she wants to have identified as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family virtually escapes the actress, Lohan follows the parents and their children.
It accuses adults of trafficking children.
She does not provide any evidence for all of this in the clip.
"the whole world is seeing this right now," Lohan is heard in the video as she continues to follow the family down the street.
Apparently she tries to separate the children from their parents.
At some point, however, it seems to be enough for the obviously angry mother.
It looks like she's turning around and giving Lohan a slap in the face.
In tears, the actress says how shocked she is - and she keeps her cheek.
What led Lohan to this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: this task has "mascot" on the asteroid
The Hayabusa2 probe launched in Japan in December 2014.
It is supposed to approach the asteroid Ryugu so much that it can suck in material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The "mascot" lander will remain on Ryugu.
Foreign ticker: number of dead on Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the severe 7.5 magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 420 people have died.
The number of victims could increase even further.
Rescue crews have not yet penetrated the devastated areas cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla chairman
In the beginning there was a tweet.
Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk caused unrest in the stock markets in early August when he announced a withdrawal of the electric car maker.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued him for fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla chief retires from the Supervisory Board, but he is allowed to remain chairman of the board.
British Conservative Party Congress
Keenly guarded - the Tories' party congress
Birmingham is becoming the stage of a power struggle.
The Party Congress is supposed to be about foreign policy, trade issues and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and Brexit hard-liners, at the forefront of ex-foreign minister Boris Johnson.
Referendum for a new state name
The foreign ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing over these name-dopplings for years.
Now they have agreed.
The state of Macedonia is to be called North Macedonia in the future and the population will vote on this Sunday - whether it is going well?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The Not") - This is Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands took to the streets in several cities to protest right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" claims to be an anti-system candidate, leading the polls.
His fiercest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the left-wing Workers "Party.
Audi: "dieselgate" processing takes longer than planned
"the diesel Task Force still exists," Development Director Peter Mertens told the industry magazine "Automobilwoche."
In December 2017, Audi chief Rupert Stadler, who was imprisoned and on leave, announced that the task force would be dissolved soon.
"in the first quarter of 2018, all engine / transmission combinations are expected to be tested," he said at the time.
Mertens said: "at the beginning of July, we reached an important milestone in dealing with the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The Task Force was set up in September 2015 following the discovery of the diesel scandal at Audi's mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the carmaker had made "serious organisational changes" so that such a scandal would never happen again.
The VW supervisory board postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and wants to discuss it further this Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse the Head of Audi of having allowed the sale of diesel cars with incorrect exhaust values after the emission fraud became known.
In doing so, he knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
Currently, Chief Sales Officer Bram Schot heads the company as acting chief executive.
Because of the change to the new exhaust and consumption test standard WLTP, there are production losses at Audi, Schot told the "Heilbronn Voice."
In principle, he sees a falling demand for sedans such as the A6, A7 and A8 audio models, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"the segment itself is difficult," he said.
Schot relies on electric mobility.
15,000 reservations have already been made for the e-tron, the first Audi electric car.
Grindel is aiming for re-election - lame is to be elected to the DFB Executive Committee
Mainz (dpa) - despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, Reinhard Grindel wants to run for office as DFB president again next year.
"I do my job and I try to do it as well as I can," Grindel said as a guest at ZDF's "current sports studio" early Sunday morning.
You have to try again and again for re-election, I will do that.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
In his own words, the head of the association would find it "strange" if he did not "want to work on the future project" after winning the 2024 Football Championship.
Grindel has been the head of the association since April 2016, succeeding Wolfgang Niersbach, who had fallen over the summer fairytale affair.
In autumn 2016, he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will take place at the DFB Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future European Championship chief executive Philipp Lahm is to be involved in the DFB Executive Committee.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that he would continue to consult the bureau in this role and would then of course be invited to provide his experience on sporting issues," said Grindel.
He did not want to participate in speculation as to whether Lahm could succeed him as head of the DFB.
As a consequence of the affair over the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in future a national player without a migration background should become Integration Ambassador of the DFB.
Currently, Cacau and Celia Sasic, a native of Brazil, hold this office, the latter having family roots in Cameroon.
"if someone without a migrant background has a clear impact on society and football and says," the issue is important, we have to take care of it, "that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground, where integration must work," said Grindel.

Basketball Bundesliga: clear success for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - Alba Berlin has started the new season of The Basketball Bundesliga with a clear victory.
Against science city Jena, the runner-up easily won with 112: 55 (52: 31) and offered a convincing match over 40 minutes.
Newcomer ROKA Giedraitis was the top scorer of the dominant Berliner with 20 points.
The Ludwigsburg-based national player Johannes Thiemann (18 points) also showed an appealing performance in front of 9113 spectators on his mandatory game debut.
Former champion Brose Bamberg won the mandatory game debut of coach ainars Bagatskis with 84: 80 (39: 37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the best thrower among the guests with 24 points.
Würzburg professional Gabriel Olaseni came on 14 points.
Last year's playoff semi-finalist MHP giant Ludwigsburg defeated Frankfurt's Fraport Skyliners 83: 76 (41: 34).
New national Karim Jallow was the most accurate shooter on coach John Patrick's team with 24 points.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a clear success.
At the basketball Lions Braunschweig, there was a clear 100: 64 (48: 30) and the first two points.
The new playmaker will Cummings topped the Oldenburgers with 25 points.
The Brunswick, where NBA star Dennis Schröder has been majority owner since the start of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26-1 run of the baskets quickly provided clear conditions.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the DITIB mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
During his three-day state visit, Erdoğan had previously met with, among others, Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to extradite supporters of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens, wherever they live.
We will not allow sympathisers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm German-Turkish friendship, "he said.
For the opening of the DITIB mosque, Cologne's city centre was partially closed.
Several thousand policemen were on duty - including snipers.
The Islam association Ditib is under criticism for being considered an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": music against poverty: stars, buhrufe and horror seconds
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B campaigned for greater commitment to the fight against poverty and disease at a joint concert in New York's Central Park.
"get involved wherever you can," Mendes said in front of around 60,000 spectators at the festival on Sunday night.
Thank you for coming here, this is a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with fringe and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid agencies, also showed up on stage at the multi-hour spectacle.
In between, however, there was a second of horror when many spectators thought the sound of a plunging metal barrier was shooting, getting scared and trying to flee.
Panic briefly ensued, people ran into confusion.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said organiser Hugh Evans.
However, the New York Police and musician Chris Martin then calmed people off the stage.
"nobody is trying to hurt anyone," Martin said.
You are all safe.
As every year, tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge on the internet.
Anyone who wanted to catch one had to read and disseminate texts, photos and videos on the internet about the global fight against poverty and disease.
There were cheers and applause from the audience for the numerous musicians and actors - but they shouted for Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
The latter, together with his Democratic colleague Chris Coons, spoke out on the stage for greater equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had spoken out in the US Senate Judiciary Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as Supreme Court judge, injuring many women.
At least three women have made allegations of abuse, including attempted rape, against Kavanaugh, whom he dismisses.
Flake called for an FBI investigation into the allegations after two women, who said they themselves experienced sexual assault, confronted him in an elevator on their way to the committee meeting.
"you can also meet me in an elevator at any time," Flake told the crowd at the concert in New York.
Press freedom: federal Government defends expulsion of journalist
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert has defended the expulsion of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the Chancellery, the Turkish journalist, who lives in Hamburg, had covered a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "freedom for journalists" and had gone into the front row.
The T-shirt, was not the problem, Seibert told the picture on Sunday.
It was a matter of disrupting the course of the press conference.
The journalist's action has caused a great deal of disquiet, which is unacceptable.
For this reason, he said, he had arranged for personal protection officers to take the man out.
Seibert said it was not permitted to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This applies regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, many journalists are in prison.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage activities or support or membership in banned parties or the Fethullah-Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership blames the Movement for the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists face several decades in prison.
Foreign journalists are also not safe from the Turkish authorities: only at the beginning of September was the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast arrested.
Most recently, the cases of jailed journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel caused a stir.
They were released and were able to return to Germany, but trials are still ongoing in Turkey against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him as fresh and good-looking: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look twice: yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - the talk show "Inas Nacht," produced by NDR, is known for its lively conversations at the bar of Hamburg's "schellfischposten" harbour pub.
Presenter Ina Müller and her guests come across some beer, some wine or even high-percentage drinks to ease the mood and tongues.
Not a few celebs are also bracing themselves for the obligatory vocal insoles.
Another episode of the popular talk show was recorded on Friday.
This time around: actor Florian David Fitz is known from films such as "men's hearts," "terror - their verdict" or "the hottest day."
But the trip to the far north was not at all good for Munich.
On Saturday, he posted a selfie - his face is completely cracked on it, his eyes only two small slits.
The bed selfie shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he is not sick, he only has a Powerful hangover.
Addressing his fans, he posted some - probably not quite serious - insights he has now gained: "rule one: never go to INA's night.
Rule two: never drink the black pig.
And spritz.
And the round egg liqueur that Ina throws at half past three also leaves.
Alcohol consumption is truly written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans posted a few tips to combat the afterwoes.
They ranged from instant broth, fish buns or - presumably most purposefully - headache tablets.
Others simply amused themselves at the sight of the normally attractive Cinema Star.
It is not yet known how Ina Müller survived the night-time drinking spree.
But since she has been hosting the TV fun at the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more tried and tested...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to contend with vandalism and betrayal
The entrance to the 36-kilometre-long railway cycle path in rotkäppchenland in Treysa is difficult to find and tired.
Recipes against rampant vandalism are being sought, but solutions are hardly emerging.
Shards, cigarette butts, rubbish and rubbish, demolished rubbish bins and now dismantled signs - this is how the entrance with a group of seats to the bike path on the Haaße hill in Treysa has been presented for some time.
For the showpiece bahnradweg in rotkäppchenland, this is a more than inglorious sight.
Members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt have also been involved in the topic for some time, according to the city's cycling commissioner, Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem has already been raised in the cycling Advisory Board.
There is no solution so far.
The proposals ranged from moving the seating group to regularly emptying the waste bins and cleaning the areas at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the order of the day - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that he has also brought the topic to the local council.
It's not just rubbish that drives cyclists and residents around - the seating group is a regular meeting point for celebrations on weekends.
Not only is it often loud, the railings are also destroyed: posts are torn from the ground, rubbish bins are demolished, signs are bent over, seating furniture is smeared.
Volunteers have already cleaned up more often, ADFC member Susanne Klippert says.
But the actions are only the proverbial drop in the ocean.
They are annoyed that the rest area on the bike path in Treysa is a meeting point for drinking.
"along the entire cycle path, the focus is clearly on the Haaße hill," confirms the Cycling Officer, who is now also concerned about the new bike site in Ziegenhain, which is being opened today.
"if she suffers the same fate, it will be really expensive."
Another idea is video surveillance on THE MOUND: "this may set the threshold significantly higher for grabbing public property.
That would, however, require a police patrol to pass in a timely manner.
In principle, Wüstenhagen wants a development of the Haaße hill.
It must be made more attractive.
You can be very satisfied with the frequency of the cycle path so far.
Tourism marketing is still expandable.
Our bike path is very high-quality compared to others in Germany, "said the ADFC members.
ADFC member Susanne Klippert considers the situation in the Ascheröder Straße in Treysa to be an extremely critical point of danger.
There is no turning lane on the Haaße hill.
In the case of heavy traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between the two-sided traffic flow, "she explains.
This is not a problem for sporty drivers, but for the elderly and especially for children.
Music contest at the Kulturbahnhof: the "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call for the music contest was a success, creative and in cooperation.
"D A Song For Hiltrup" is the appeal of the district offensive Hiltrup, in the "Music Contest for big and small, young and experienced musicians."
A contest "with a wink in the sympathetic Hiltruper family," as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family meeting with coffee and cake from the volunteers of the Kulturbahnhof.
There were seven formations, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long-time albachtener living in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltruper sternfarben," three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and the zwarties.
This contest, said district mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We have not seen this in other parts of the city.
What was the connection between the texters?
The Hiltruper Lake and marktallee were particularly frequently mentioned in the towns.
Rolf Ihmig named the avenue "Kö von Hiltrup" in his hit song.
The Kulturbahnhof was also honoured.
Time and again, it was about experiencing togetherness in these places, especially at Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short breaks with short interviews with the interpreters or hints about their work.
Humberg was told that he had actually studied chemistry, but now also taught guitar.
Franke knew from the sound engineer Stefan schemmelmann that he recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic, meanwhile, has placed a lot on YouTube.
"it's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy.
However, there was something special for the jury's favourites - so that others can also listen to their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel untied can record a full CD with sound engineer schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup hit, which particularly impressed Franke with its musicality, and the "Lummerland pack": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone else, the children appeared again for the final - and even sounded "Really Good" without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, catchiness of the melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller of the Westfälische Schule für Musik, Andreas Klomfaß of the KVG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers OF THE Wirtschaftsverbund, as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the stadtteilooffensive.
The district offensive launched the event on the occasion of its 10th anniversary.
She considered the event to be a complete success.
Everyone was "very satisfied," and "the atmosphere was good" at the soon-to-be-packed Kulturbahnhof.
The word game: "decrypto" in the game Test
The players form two teams facing each other.
For each side, there is a screen, in which four cards with keywords, which - the old trick with the red foil - can only be deciphered once they have been inserted.
This ensures that the other side cannot read anything by mistake.
On the cards, for example, you can read from left to right: "1st renaissance.
2. Window.
3. Dice.
4. Feast. "
These are the terms to be encapsulated from now on.
Because it is not the terms that should be guessed here, but codes.
Alternately, one player per team is the coder.
He gets a code card, on which perhaps "3.4.2." is written.
In "decrypto," it is not the terms behind the secret foil that are to be guessed, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case is to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "cube," "solid" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and, if possible, the opposing team does not; because the game wins if he succeeds twice in cracking the code.
So the encoder notes and reads aloud: "throw" for the dice, "loose" as opposed to firm; here, of course, something like "party" would be possible, and "Prague" because he took care of the school and knows the fall of the window there.
So it continues round by round, Team by team.
One does not know the terms of the opposite side - but it can be better combined with any hint that the encoder gives there.
So the paraphrases should be as mysterious as possible, but not too twisted, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptic thing about "decrypto" is the rule book.
The players will probably have to study it for quite a long time until they can finally play.
The explanatory video on decrypto.info on the web makes it easier.
But once you've got started, you'll be intrigued by how much feeling there is in this unassuming game.
Overall, however, "decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as its predecessor and genre Primus "codenames," which also puts an agency theme on a game of fewer words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And if you're just talking about guessing and not winning points, you can easily invent a version for two.
Kulmbach: man shows police Hitler salute and molests guests in pub
A 48-year-old man employed the Kulmbach Police Inspectorate twice during the night from Saturday to Sunday.
First he showed the Hitler salute in the upper town of a passing police patrol, later he also noticed in the upper town in a pub when he harassed other guests.
After he was clearly alcoholic and did not comply with the assigned place reference by the police, he had to spend the night at the Kulmbach Police Inspectorate in the detention centre.
In a sober state, he will also have to face criminal charges for using the license plates of unconstitutional organizations.
The pressig plant was home to the schubloks
The railway plant in pressig has been the hub in the Frankenwald for decades.
A piece of railway history ended in 1991.
"when buffers banged on buffers, you could hear it in a hurry," recalls Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
That didn't excite anyone.
The brakes also squeaked and rattled the cars.
That was pure railways.
Statements that are emblematic of Dinkel's homeland.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so marked by the railways.
Here was the starting point of the steep-Ramp mountain route to the north, which has its apex in Steinbach am Wald after a rise of about 220 metres in altitude.
In order to cope with this, train and school blocks were used, which had their home in pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian State Parliament approved the construction of a railway workshop with 21 locomotive sheds, apprentice workshop, cableway and Railway Master's workshop.
"the centrepiece was the turntable, which had a diameter of 18 metres after a reconstruction in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, a railway historian and a professional railway worker for 47 years.
The railway works (BW) pressig, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, also operated locomotives for the secondary lines pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - North half.
On 15 July 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160; at the time, 13 steam engines and eight elloks were stationed in pressig.
The electrification of the line in 1939 already minimized the need for train and school blocks.
From 1977, they were only used on freight trains.
By 1991, at least 10,000 cars were still ranked in the month.
In 1982, parts of the plant were demolished, and the rest in 1991.
Heidrich: "it is regrettable that it has not been envisaged to make better use of the site, including in terms of freight transport."
On Pentecost 1989, the Nuremberg railway authority celebrated a pompous station Festival in pressig to mark the anniversary of "50 Years of electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld."
"there were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," recalls Georg Dinkel.
A little later, the end.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were removed, and the pressig marshalling yard was history.
"the shunders And the shooters did the most difficult work in train traffic," recalls Dinkel.
Any wrongdoing would have had fatal consequences.
Why the pressig-Rothenkirchen railway station has led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many more historical and current images can be found here in the infrankenplus article.
Kerber with a first-round success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon champion Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round at the tennis tournament in Beijing, as Julia Görges has done before.
Kerber won 6: 2, 6: 2 against French Kristina Mladenovic at the China Open.
The next opponent of the world number three is either Julia putinzewa of Kazakhstan or the Spaniard Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6: 3, 4: 2 against Darja kassatkina, when the Russian, who was placed at number 13, gave up.
The Swabian is now dealing with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
As part of the "art and enjoyment" series, a special exhibition was opened in mittelehrenbach at the weekend.
Organisers and visitors registered with great relief looked at the ideal weather when the special Vernissage "Wind play performance" was opened in the open-air area of the dahlmann- Schmidt estate, mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the umbrella of the tourism association "around Walberla" as part of the series "art and enjoyment."
It opened its doors in the 15th year.
The fascination of the exhibition was shown by a large number of visitors.
Twenty-one copies of 20 artists can now be seen in mittelehrenbach.
Host Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the vernissage.
He himself has been there since the very first hour.
Just like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist.
Somewhat surprisingly, however, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he placed his task in proven, young hands with good prospects for the future.
Both have been actively involved in the selection of artists in the past and have helped design flyers.
Once again this year, on the occasion of Art & Pleasure, there will be a special 70-cent stamp designed by you, available at every art station.
This year's poster "Betzn austanz," designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased there for eight Euros.
Hahn was delighted with the high response of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg could be won for the musical accompaniment.
As you walk through the spacious garden, it quickly becomes clear to the visitor that the title "Wind play performance" literally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it playfully.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramic, often with colour accents.
Already at the entrance of the property, the visitor is waiting on the right side of the "Lucky Tree" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, brightened in colour, playfully provided with 20 wind turbines, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminium tubes as a sound piece.
With the sun shining through the bush in the background, the object looks fairytale-like and invites you to linger.
From Eckental comes Barbara Waschneck, who prefers to dedicate 15 years of K & G to the event in three-dimensional letters.
There are many parts, moving in the wind.
Halfway through, Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "The wind the heavenly child."
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows off his colourful fantasy structure of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Wind play performance" for strolling through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited until 31 December 2018.
50 Years of MGV 68 Albachten: singers celebrate 50th birthday
1968 - that was the time of protest and the student movement.
And the albachtener also gave vent to their displeasure at the time.
At least five of them.
They did not want to resign themselves to the fact that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should be no more sangesleben in the district.
It has become a legend: at a bank in tinnenbusch, they launched the MGV 68 Albachten.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary has been celebrated in the "House of Encounter."
"it will be full today," said Chairman Jürgen holstiege, and he should be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the albachtener singers.
Especially for the anniversary, they had revived the foundation festival.
For years it was tradition, then there was a break.
Just in time for the 50th anniversary, the traditional festival was back.
It became an elegant ball, festive clothing had been asked for before.
The guests did not sit in rows of seats as usual in the "House of Encounter," but comfortably at tables.
In between, movement was called for: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln pulled on the controls and asked for the dance floor.
It is a matter of honour that the singers of the MGV 68 Albachten themselves made the voice sound.
Cheerful songs were appropriate for the occasion.
Almost stated: "such a day, as beautiful as it is today."
Matching the exquisite grape juice that many had in front of them, there was the "Rüdesheim Wine."
Alluding to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus" sounded, which is the Latin term for "hops."
Once again, the choir was sovereign by Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were in tinnenbusch at the time.
"it's just fun to sing under his direction," said holstiege, "he has such an easy way, it's a feat he does." by the way, this time not only men presented themselves as singers.
The ladies "choir" Hohe c "was also a guest, whose repertoire mainly includes evergreens from the 1920s to the 1960s.
Finally, there was poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had sat at the desk until three in the morning to create his own rhymes.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented fine-sounding poetry.
There was also a big raffle.
The proceeds will be used to fund the Children of the Albatros youth centre for a visit to the all-weather zoo.

Volleyball: 3rd League Women: USC II wins high-class derby against BW Aasee
The climber marches.
Three games, three victories - the reserve of the USC Münster under the patronage of Axel Büring is well placed in League Three.
No trace of shyness or fractures, the independents do their thing.
And that's really good with the 3-0 (25: 15, 25: 23, 26: 24) against City competitor BW Aasee.
"it was not crystal clear, but we have already made an impression," says the reasonably satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai annacker immediately agreed: "this is a defeat that we can live with very well.
We are not dissatisfied. "on the contrary.
In the evening, at a subsequent birthday party by Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game ticked off.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical illusion.
In the third set, the guests had a set ball.
"if you get it to the goal, a game like this can be tipped," Büring knows from years of experience.
Finally, the USC, with its experienced forces, made everything clear and brought the full yield to the finish.
"we are all aware of who is on the other side in such a derby.
That doesn't break our neck.
I have seen really good volleyball in phases, "annacker did not quarrel with the 0: 3 - and went straight to the agenda.
After just three days of play, it seems impossible to predict where The Independent will be heading.
"it's just too early for that," says Axel Büring.
Only in one thing does he feel confirmed: "the 3rd league has an incredibly good level.
This is not nearly comparable with Regionalliga volleyball. "they don't want to turn their gaze down to the fourth league anyway.
If the vest is not soiled in the next few weeks, you will have to look up.
However, a first balance can only be drawn after ten or eleven games.
On Saturday we head to Emlichheim.
Aasee arrives in Essen on 14 October.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
Heide Keller became a star on the "Dream Ship."
Now she talks openly that the series may have been complicit in her marriage to Hans von Borsody.
Her role as chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "Dream Ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but she went off board for good on January 1, 2018.
The series, which made her a star, could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
"that could have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, travelled around the world alone with a suitcase, and many colleagues I admired noticed me on an equal footing, "Keller says in a conversation with" Bild am Sonntag. "
At first she was only "the Wife of Hans von Borsody," but that changed with the "Dream Ship."
For now, the journalists only called Heide Keller.
"I don't know if he liked it so much."
She thinks it is possible that her husband at the time might have been envious, but "like many men, Hans was afraid of talking about problems and feelings."
Keller has always tried to be the only right person for Hans von Borsody and he did not want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
This means in good German: I have changed my mind, "she explained.
She always felt that she was "not good enough for him.
He saw me as an emancipated woman, who I never really was, even though I sometimes appeared cheeky and brave on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever. "
After a marriage to Thomas härtner that had already failed, Keller said yes again, "although I was afraid it could go wrong a second time."
The day before the civil ceremony, I sat in the dressing room crying and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to von Borsody also failed.
Why did it never work out with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
At the time, Keller imagined love "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I have approached love far too naively. "
The nachtfalter, who regularly explores the city's nightlife in the NZZ resort of Zurich, has ventured to the ZFF opening party this time.
Our Butterfly is not a moth, but a little light shy.
And the dazzling glow in which a green carpet is plunged on Sechseläutenplatz dazzles him for a fee.
But it's just a film festival, more or less famous people want to sunbathe in the spotlight.
So he scoops over the square this late Thursday evening to briefly ease himself in the "AquaClean toilet oasis."
This is the name of the public toilet facility sponsored by a large plumbing company, which is celebrating its premiere at the festival: the Need center on the ground floor of a new pavilion is making a lot of effort to exude a luxurious ambience.
That evening, however, it stinks to the sky in the men's Oasis for some reason.
So get out of here, across to the other side of the road: invited guests, who have just entertained at the best level in the cinema next door to the opening film "Green Book," celebrate the start of the festival with a party in the three-storey department store as every year.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: the works shown are known to come from all over the world.
What don't you have to think of in an article about this festival, in order not to fall into a sneak advertisement for its 190 partner companies.
The butterfly binds a ribbon around the antennae, which has given him a fairy godmother, and two bullish doormen actually wave him in generously.
Inside, the invited crowd, they dance to live music well after midnight, or let DJ dictate rhythms to which they yell at each other, and rinse down exquisite appetizers with Cüpli.
In the delicatessen shop in the basement, oysters wait for sipping mouths, next door the incomparable Culatello di Zibello ham is freshly cut and a chocolate fountain is bubbling.
And the hammer is: all the shelves full of exclusive products have not been removed for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without major losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The butterfly studies the sign at the escalator: "wear a long dress, please be careful on the escalator."
If these are two separate instructions, he has lost himself in the dresscode.
But it is more of a conditional construction, and it has certainly saved lives.
In the upstairs dinnerware section, the winged man tilts a cocktail made with espresso called "Golden Eye," matching the festival award.
The prize for the best drink is not necessarily awarded to this mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself.
And George Clooney, who has been campaigning for this brand for years, isn't here that evening either.
But a face that seems familiar to the observer passes between local celebrities, a coffee table and kitchen utensils: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His leading actor is not likely to be far away.
And really: Viggo Mortensen walks through the crowd, almost like a choir boy, at almost sixty.
He is not talked about, not understood, at most people are stealing away.
International stars love this film festival precisely for this restraint, often misunderstood as clumsiness.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with cumbia dancing
Coach and ex-football star Diego Maradona is delighted with his team's victory.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona seems to have settled well in his new home Mexico.
After a 2-0 victory by his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced to cumbia rythms with a player in the cabin, according to a video released on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in a yellow jersey, cheered by the players.
The Mexican runner-up defeated Leones Negros 2-0 on Saturday.
After the game, Maradona called into a TV camera "always with my boys, always."
The 57-year-old has been training the Mexican club since early September.
Handball: Verbandsliga 1: ASV send "devastated" after last minute bust
Swen bieletzki, coach of the Handball Association team ASV, could hardly believe it: "such a bitter defeat." his protégés were "devastated" after the unfortunate 29: 30 (12: 14) - broke - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday night at LIT Germania 2.
As in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst, they had not played badly for long periods, the Sendener.
Only the initial phase "we slept completely," the ASV coach was annoyed.
The owners quickly led with 8: 1, and even the early break that bieletzki had taken did not at first bear fruit.
"but then suddenly a jolt went through the team," bieletzki summed up the second quarter of an hour.
At the break, the gap was only two goals.
Above all, Senden's best, Marius Hintze, hit the stage one by one.
After the change, things got even better from a visitor's point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst equalised to 15: 15, after which the relay changer led almost continuously.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still seemingly reassuring three hits (29: 26).
And then?
The non-partisans intervened in the event.
Bieletzki is usually wary of trying to blame others.
But: Steffen Mühlhoff's 120-second time penalty "was a joke."
Lit had a good laugh and hit four more times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys fought Great, stood well in the back against seven men and kept throwing them on the empty goal.
Only they can buy Little for compliments.
"now a damning victory has to come," said bieletzki, who served completely.
ASV-Tore: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hüging (1).
Bayern: woman missing for 30 years - police dig for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an 18-year-old from Naila (Hof county), police are searching for the woman's mortal remains.
Emergency crews dug up a road at Marxgrün on Saturday.
For this purpose, the road surface and several layers below it were removed, police and prosecutors jointly announced.
According to new findings, the missing person may have been buried not far from their home at the time.
The woman has disappeared since November 4, 1986.
Investigators did not rule out a crime at the time.
Since last year, the Hof criminal police have been working intensively on the case together with the public prosecutor's office, according to the information.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian monument protection authority, the investigators discovered an anomaly under the road near Marxgrün by means of a ground radar.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officers limited the site to a few metres.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows the dangers lurking on the net.
However, users themselves can also provide additional security.
Instead of complicated sequences of letters, users should rather use passphrases to secure their accounts on the net.
In addition, security updates, such as for windows, should be installed quickly, and there is no harm in equipping computers with anti-virus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of electric car maker Tesla, has escaped his looming dismissal as head of the multi-billion dollar company.
He and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed out-of-court litigation over misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.
As part of the settlement, Musk and Tesla pay $20 million each, and Musk cedes the post of chairman for three years, a position comparable to the German chairman of the Supervisory Board.
He is allowed to remain chairman of the board.
In the settlement, which has yet to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla acknowledged wrongdoing.
The SEC had sued the world-renowned manager in the U.S. Federal Court of Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who also heads SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-making electric car pioneer, which is now valued at more than $50 billion on the stock market.
Musk is not aware of any guilt
Musk said he had done nothing wrong and was saddened and disappointed with the lawsuit.
He has always acted in the interests of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk had written to his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might take the company off the stock market, paying $420 per share, with funding secured.
This would have put Tesla at $72 billion in total.
Later, Musk rushed back: Tesla remains on the stock market.
Following the agreement, Tesla will now have to find an outside chairman, hire two independent board members and also set up a committee to oversee Musk's communications.

Polls: 46 percent don't want Merkel to be chancellor by 2021
After the squabbles of the past few weeks, the GroKo is collecting several poll lows.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in a survey - Angela Merkel is seen critically.
Berlin - the AfD overtook the SPD for the first time nationwide in the Emnid Sunday evening for Bild am Sonntag.
In the weekly poll of the opinion research institute, the AfD increases by one meter to 17 percent, the SPD gives a point compared to the previous week and ends up at 16 percent.
The CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only reach 27 percent.
This is the lowest value so far for the Union on Sunday night.
The Greens reach 15 percent, the left 11 percent and the FDP 10 percent.
If the Bundestag elections were to take place on Sunday, the governing parties SPD, CDU and CSU would, according to Emnid, only get 43 percent of the vote together.
With this, the grand coalition has now lost the majority in all major research institutes - with the exception of Allensbach - on the Sunday issue.
The governing parties consistently reach 43 to 45 percent of the vote (Allensbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 Bundestag election, they received a combined 53.4 percent.
Among the other parties, the range is also wide: the AfD, the second-strongest party in several polls, is 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens reach votes of 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is averaging 10 percent, the FDP is 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, according to the percentage of votes, such polls have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down.
But the popular support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has also fallen significantly since the 2017 federal election.
Currently, only 48 percent of citizens think Merkel is the right person in the Chancellery, according to the Emnid poll commissioned by the BAMs.
According to the survey, only one in two (50 per cent) currently wants the grand coalition to hold in three years until the next regular Bundestag election, with 41 per cent in favour of a new election.
A further poll published on Saturday also showed a significant drop in Merkel's popularity.
The Germans are also divided about whether Merkel should run for the CDU presidency again in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are in favour, 44 percent against.
According to this, 64 percent of union supporters want a candidacy, 35 percent do not.
Notice at Aldi: reduced PRICE for Happiness
Will Aldi become tinder 2.0?
Anyone who says that in times of Tinder there are no more romantic stories of acquaintances - should talk about turkey meat at Aldi.
Munich - in times of digital "fast food dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket, as a meeting place for the great love, radiates almost an anachronistic romance.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, Boxer Short bargains at the voles table or the favourite pudding is, in doubt, still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The Tinder app has a reputation for being a slippery Stock Exchange rather than a contact.
We took the test: how do women react, you don't talk about the hot porridge for long in the first message?
Here is the amazing result.
True Hollywood lovestory potential comes when love happiness is preceded by an out-of-sight, lost-and-found plot.
If the guy then also gets in touch with his lover at the e-mail address bio-Putenfleisch @ gmx.de, it sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and his companions - romantic comedy at it's best.
For example, the author of this advert in an Aldi branch unknown to us, wishes that she will also find her dream man, with whom she spoke briefly about the "30 percent reduced organic turkey meat."
For her belief in the magic of analogue acquaintance, she definitely deserved her happy ending à la Hollywood.
Billerbeck: 500 lids for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, ludgerischule has been involved in the "lids against polio - 500 lids for a life without polio."
Polio is the abbreviation for poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by polioviruses.
The disease, described in German as polio, leads from symptoms of paralysis to death.
In Germany, polio is considered eradicated, but there are still three countries in the world where the disease occurs.
The cause of poliomyelitis, the polioviruses, can so far only be contained by vaccinations, according to a press release.
Football: Reus and Zorc demand rest for idols
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB sports director Michael Zorc and Captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public debate on the form and fitness of Mario Götze.
"we should stop worrying about Mario.
This does not do the boy any good.
And that doesn't do us any good, "Reus, who is friends with Götze, said after the 4-2 victory in Leverkusen on TV channel Sky.
Zorc had already stressed before the game.

Football: district league: VFL Wolbeck's appearance against SC Altenrheine encourages researchers
There were moments in this still young season when Alois Fetsch went to court with his colleagues.
The coach of the football district league team VfL Wolbeck, he gave himself up with words and withdrew (inwardly) to reflect on the lack of willingness to perform on the green.
All history.
In the meantime, it is running around the brandhoveweg again.
Baptismal proof is the 1: 1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrheine, in the past season only very thinly slipped past the ascent.
Yes, I am very pleased with the performance.
"we made the Rooms Tight and put pressure on the ball.
This could be seen, "Fetsch praised his boys and visited each individual after the match to simply say" thank you "for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.
After the injury to Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - Luca Rehberg came for him - the 4-4-2 moved almost seamlessly into a 4-2-3-1, where Niklas Thewes was in the front line waiting for balls.
Wolbeck had significantly more game shares in the first section.
And opportunities.
But Frerichs before his exit (17th), the interchanged Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
That would almost have come to an end when the SCA hit the Wolbecker Kasten twice in minute 41 in the person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris naberbäumer - goalkeeper Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his trade.
After the break, the VFL took full control.
Thewes, from 18 metres, narrowly failed.
Schroer also came too late at a Thewes entry after 58 minutes.
With the replacement of Miles Geske, Fetsch missed another fresh cell treatment on the left.
When altenrheines Chris naberbäumer fell Robin Westhues in the 70th minute, there was an indirect free kick for the placeholders 18 metres in front of the guest housing.
The fouled man stepped in himself and demonstrated his dangerousness by standards.
Westhues "thing with the right flap hit down the left from the shooter's point of view - 1: 0 (71.).
20 minutes left, which should be damned long.
And then that: VFL captain Florian Quabeck unhappily flew the leather in the penalty area to his hand in the 80th minute.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79.).
Wolbeck had to get over some anxious minutes in the closing stages before Geske had the Victory goal on the net from twelve metres in the 87th minute.
Might have been too much of a good thing.
VFL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26. L. Rehberg), Westhues, vielmeyer (66. Geske) - Thewes

Eintracht Frankfurt wins 4-1 against Hannover 96
Starting position: four points after five days of play - that was not enough for coach Adi Hütter.
Against Hannover 96, Eintracht Frankfurt finally wanted to secure their first home victory.
Striker Ante Rebic, who was in the starting line for the first time after an injury, should help.

Helicopters crashed in Kottingbrunn
When landing, an accident occurred at the airfield.
The four inmates were slightly injured.
At around 2pm on Sunday, a drama took place at the airport in Kottingbrunn.
The landing of a helicopter caused turbulence, police have confirmed to OE24.
The Heli was caught by a gust of wind, crashed to the ground and came to a halt on the side.
Police, rescue and fire services were immediately notified.
The emergency crews arrived at the scene of the accident with a large contingent.
The ÖAMTC emergency medical helicopter was also called for caution.
Inmates only slightly injured
Luckily, everything turned out to be largely harmless.
There is only one damage.
The four inmates were only slightly injured and were able to return home on their own.
The exact circumstances surrounding the accident have not yet been clarified and are the subject of the investigation.
According to Fire spokesman Franz Resperger, a small fire occurred, but it could be quickly extinguished.
AllBright Foundation report: women remain a rarity on company boards
As a result, only 8 percent of the board members were female as of 1 September, according to the report "The Power of monoculture," which will be officially presented by the AllBright Foundation this Monday and was presented to the German press agency in advance.
"the companies will have to set themselves up differently, otherwise the international competitors will pass them by," said the managing director of the Foundation, Wiebke Ankersen.
In the USA, Great Britain or Sweden, male-only management teams - with a few exceptions - are no longer conceivable.
In comparison, the backlog makes German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and forward-looking.
It's a different corporate culture.
The slight increase in the proportion of women among German stock exchange companies is also due solely to positive impulses among companies in the index of medium-sized stocks (MDAX).
According to AllBright, only 6.8 percent of board members are female.
In the previous year, however, the figure was 3.8 percent.
Among the 30 DAX companies - trailblazers in recent years - the proportion of women has stagnated.
Most recently, 26 women worked on the boards.
"I am sure that the DAX companies will recruit more consistent women next year - in their own interest," said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have signalled that they would continue to make no commitment to increase the proportion of "zero percent" to date.
A different picture emerges for the supervisory boards: as of 1 September, the proportion of women there was 30.5 percent - 45 more women and 68 fewer men than a year ago.
"if just as many women were recruited to the board each year, the proportion would have reached 40 percent by 2023," the report says.
Some even make mischief: luxury Car bodies: which manufacturer earns the most per car?
Ferrari deserve the best.
The Italians take 280,000 euros with each Ferrari sold and make 69,000 euros in operating profit.
Big cars, big profits: this slogan still applies today - in most cases.
Who makes the most profit per car among the noble suppliers.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: how much do luxury manufacturers charge per car they sell?
"autopapst" and professor of economics Ferdinand Dudenhöffer dealt with this question.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
Ferrari made 69,000 euros in operating profit with every car sold in the first half of the Year - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only comes to around 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley even make a big difference with every car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the running with prices ranging from an average of 33,000 to 38,000 Euros per car and around 3,000 euros in earnings before interest and taxes EBIT.

At the start of the anniversary, the people in charge moved through the town to the festival area under the sounds of the Spielmannszug from Wiesenbronn.
The chairman of the Tourist Association, Wolfgang Starz, Mayor Jürgen Schulz and Wine Princess Lisa Kursawe welcomed the guests in the already crowded Marquee. "60 Years of organising something like this is an incredible achievement for a small town with 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of that, "Starz thanked all the helpers.
Wine princess Lisa II later struck symbolically with the guests from the stage.
"it's nice that so many have found their way back to us after Abtswind." later, "the troglauers" provided the atmosphere.
On Sunday, when the abtswinder Kirchweih was also celebrated, the association had set the drinks prices as they were 60 years ago on the occasion of the anniversary in the afternoon.
A festive evening for the 60th Wine Festival will take place on Friday, October 5, at the guest's house, before heading into the second round in the marquee a day later.
In Bonn: emergency doctor's car crashes into taxi
An emergency ambulance stands badly damaged next to a road.
A 27-year-old passer-by was fatally injured in the collision of the emergency vehicle with a taxi.
When emergency doctors are called, they should help - preferably save lives.
Such a rescue drive came to a fatal end for a 26-year-old in Bonn.
Bonn - A 26-year-old pedestrian was fatally injured in the collision of an emergency medical van with a taxi in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and their drivers were seriously injured, police said.
The 46-year-old driver of the emergency room had crossed a red light on Saturday afternoon with blue light and Martinshorn.
He then collided at an intersection with the taxi, which was driving at Green.
The Doctor's Car hurled against a traffic light pole and a tree after the collision.
He caught the passer-by, who died at the scene of the accident.
Driver of the ambulance and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the ambulance were locked in their vehicles seriously injured and had to be freed by emergency personnel.
The 29-year-old emergency doctor, who was also seriously injured, was able to free herself, but the pedestrian was no longer able to help her.
Another emergency doctor called In tried this - but without success.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
The police, in close consultation with the Bonn Public Prosecutor's Office, determine who is to blame for the accident.
Manchester United lose again, for Mourinho we feel uncomfortable
Manchester United are now also losing in the seventh round of the Premier League, following the blameless finish in the ligacup.
Against West Ham United, Manu is subject to 1: 3. The way of defeat is likely to be talked about.
The scene was emblematic in the 74th minute, when the recovered Marko Arnautovic shot the 3-1 for West Ham; just three minutes after Marcus Rashford allegedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
As they suspected an offside at Mark Nobel's pass, all Manchester's defenders stopped, leaving Arnautovic all the time in the world to pass the ball past the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative culmination of a performance that had already been insufficient for a long time.
The mood at Uniteds city rival Manchester City is very different at the moment.
Citizens trained by Mourinho's big competitor Pep Guardiola came to an unthreatened 2-0 win against Brighton & Hove Albion.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke through the outsider's defensive bar for the home team for the first time.
After a good hour and a double pass with the former goalscorer, Sergio Agüero ensured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer leader of the standings
Three days after the 1-2 ligacup defeat, Xherdan Shaqiri fought Chelsea 1-1 with Liverpool in the Premier League.
As with the cup-out, Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man at the Londoners.
The 27-year-old's hit in the 25th minute remained the game's only hit until the closing stages.
Shaqiri, who came on the field for Mohamed Salah in the 66th minute, narrowly missed the equaliser after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge did better in the 89th minute with his Schlenzer.
So, after the Reds started the week with a flawless record, Chelsea could not be beaten for the second time.
First, the Londoners eliminated the team of Jurgen Klopp in the cup, with the draw in the league, the Blues now also knocked Liverpool off the top of the table.
Like City, London City Clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) celebrated 2-0 victories.
However, the fans of the Gunners, where Granit Xhaka played through, had to wait until the 81st minute for a success message against the surprise team from Hertfordshire.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart unhappily busted Alex Iwobi into his own goal, only two minutes later Mesut Özil made the decision with his third goal of the season.
Arsenal moved past Watford thanks to their fifth consecutive victory and are now in fifth place behind their big rival Tottenham. Wolverhampton continues to make a strong impression under his Portuguese coach, Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained unbeaten in the 2-0 against Southampton in the league for the fifth time in a row, finishing 8th.
VW's core brand is missing: Paris Motor Show in the wake of the diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years alternating with the Frankfurt Motor Show.
Paris - officially not an issue and yet ubiquitous: the diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofits should not let go of the German car companies even at the industry meeting in Paris.
From next week, they will be showcasing their innovations in the French capital together with competitors from all over the world at the 2018 motor show.
The diesel does not really play a major role any more.
However, the possible exchange and retrofitting offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are still to be negotiated with the government in Berlin until then, are likely to be an important topic, at least behind the shiny backdrop of the exhibition stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: the Volkswagen Group is involved with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are here and have their first pure electric models among others: the Ingolstadt-based e-tron is due to be launched at the end of the year, the Stuttgart-based EQC in 2019.
But both have already been officially presented.
The iNext of BMW is not scheduled to start until 2021.
The focus in Paris is on the new 3-series.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors will be represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle manufacturers as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are also present in their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years alternately with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, a good one million visitors came.
At least 380 people have died in the severe earthquake and tsunami that followed on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
There are also more than 500 people injured.
The island was shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had a magnitude of 5.9, the second a magnitude of 7.4.
Communications and transport links have been damaged, and there has been enormous damage to property.
After the quake, the tsunami hit the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds had gathered on the beach for a party.
It is feared that the number of victims will increase significantly.
So far, the figures have only come from Palu.
However, many other communities are also affected - along Sulawesi's west coast.
About 150 bikers celebrate church service in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final service for motorcyclists in the Peace Church in eveking with a team of helpers on Sunday.
Werdohl - the square in front of the Peace Church in eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final service for the bikers was on the agenda.
Frank Schröder is the motor Pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and is therefore responsible for the Pastoral Care of the PS-strong two-cyclist.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle service (Mogo) takes place on the last Sunday of each month at Haus Nordhelle.
The bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season at the Peace Church in eveking.
Around 150 bikers gathered there on Sunday to conduct a service that was anything but ordinary.
The race cars were already lined up in front of the entrance gate of the Church from 10am.
At first, the biker-Frühschoppen was on the programme and it was possible to fortify itself with coffee and cake or even with a hearty currywurst.
In addition to the Mogo team, there were also the holy riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach.
The sermon was given during the biker service by Reverend Dirk Grzegorek.
The musical accompaniment was provided by singer-songwriter Valerie Lill.
"although the bikers prefer blues rock, Valerie Lill is more poetic and calm," says Rev. Frank Schröder.
This, too, was certainly a novelty in the history of the motorcycle service yesterday.
Füchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates a big festival: after the Apple comes the milk
And borisch was also active on the actual day of action.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-niemerg also aroused great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated to his astonished spectators step by step the process from ripe apple to apple juice.
Then and then Hartmann-niemerg left the field to the children and let them fill the apples in the big funnel.
With a little muscle power, the apples became a finely crushed mass.
Not many of the children could imagine how this would turn into a tasty drink.
But they were also able to look at this important step on this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in shapes and surrounded by nets, Georg Hartmann-niemerg stacked the apple pieces, which look a little like chunks, on top of each other layer by layer.
Thanks to a certain amount of technical support, the last step was not so difficult.
The freshly squeezed juice gradually ran into a large vessel.
But the farmer from füchtorfer also had ready-filled specialities with him.
So he opened his "treasure chest" and presented the latest feather whites to the older visitors.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was correspondingly high.
The parents got into conversation in a cosy atmosphere, while the children were not only able to follow the process of pressing apples, but also discovered the bouncy castle built up for themselves.
Active members of the füchtorfer camaraderie of former soldiers also took part in the festival and invited to entertaining games at some stations.
The Heimatverein will also be offering a day of action next year.
But then, as Gregor krützkamp pointed out, the home in the heart of the asparagus village will not be the place of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the topic: after all, it will be all about milk.
1: 4 against Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth season bust: "shitty situation"
Frankfurt / Main after the fourth successive Bundesliga defeat, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed Hanover 96 professionals around him and encouraged them.
However, there was not much positive to be seen before in the 1: 4 (0: 2) of the last in the standings at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"it's a shitty situation, but you have to get out of it as a team," 96 football professional Pirmin Schwegler said, pushing: "that's disappointing, of course, because you always plan a lot."
Lower Saxony, for which Florent Muslija (86.) was the only one to succeed, is at the bottom with two counts and is a candidate for relegation in its current constitution.
Led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt, on the other hand, celebrated its first home win of the season.
Evan obite ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45th + 1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59th) and Luka Jovic (89th) scored in front of 46,300 spectators for the DFB Cup winner, who, after the successful rehearsal for the Europa League match against Lazio Rome, advanced to the centre of the table with seven points.
Croatia's Vice-World Champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive action by Hesse on his debut, and was never able to get a grip on Hanover's defence.
The striker, long battered after the World Cup, showed with his pace and assertiveness why he is so valuable for harmony.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, who was borrowed from Liverpool FC, was for the first time in the initial formation of the people of Frankfurt, who started with enthusiasm.
A header from Lucas Torró (17th), which was misled onto the goal net, brought danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller, in a promising position, was stopped at the last moment by the 96 defence around Brazilian Felipe, who replaced short-term Kevin Wimmer (back).
The leadership for the owners of the house fell almost inevitably and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penalty area after a fenced-off corner, Haller extended his head in front of the goal, where ndicka only needed to hold his foot.
It was the first Bundesliga hit for the defender, who came in the summer from the French second league player AJ Auxerre.
And Frankfurt followed up before the break.
This time, Haller matched his Storm Partner Rebic, who skillfully duped and left 96 goalie Michael Esser with no chance.
At half-time, Hannover coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak performance of his eleven and brought two new offensive forces to Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxony now played a little bolder forward, but igniting ideas remained until shortly before the end, when the connection hit was still successful.
The Hessians were much more efficient.
After about an hour, Rebic started a solo and then put it across de Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was just a show run for the Frankfurt team against overtaxed guests, and Jovic also hit a minute before the end.
Morlaix square turns into a party mile
Würselen despite cool temperatures, there was a good mood at the Oktoberfest in the city centre.
The Mayor of Munich, Dieter Reiter, made it to the millions at the opening of the 185.
Munich dismissed 'N with two blows last week.
Geisingen: Geising Christians celebrate Holy Cross festival
Geising Catholics celebrate the Feast of the Holy Cross on 14 September or on Sunday afterward.
The festive service takes place in the city church, followed by a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the final blessing.
The Church of the Holy Cross is home to the shocked Christ, who came from the 30-year war and is believed to have been shot by a Swedish soldier.
Blood then flowed from the gunshot wound.
This resulted in a large pilgrimage to the shocked Christ, which then led to the construction of the Church of the Holy Cross.
This is still not finished, only the Altar Room is standing, the missing nave is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, father Adolf Buhl recalls that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
The service was poorly attended despite its significance for the Geisinger Parish.
After the service, the procession to the Church of the Holy Cross took place and with the final blessing the ecclesiastical part of the feast of the Cross ended.
For many years, the Catholic Church Choir has been inviting people to the Catholic parish hall for the secular part of the festival.
The choir members provided the visitors with hearty food as well as a wide selection of cakes and adapted to the weather, bauernhofeis.
In the afternoon, the parish still offered guided tours around the town church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed the visitors on behalf of the parish community about the damage to the facade, roof, sandstone works and windows, as well as the upcoming construction work, which will continue into the next year.
After the scaffolding has been in place for some time, the damage could be determined more precisely and the individual tenders could be prepared more concretely.
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage that already existed a few years ago has increased, but more has also been found, which was only made possible by the inspection using scaffolding.
The pedestal plastering work has been completed, the natural stone work is to be started before winter and it is hoped that more than half of this work will be completed this year.
Inauguration: new residential home in Neu-Ulm münsterblickstraße
The Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller is opening a new residential home in münsterblickstraße for people with disabilities.
The fact that "a very special house" will now be handed over to its destination in münsterblickstraße - all those present agreed on the inauguration date.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the living quarters of the Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller for some time now rely on the special architecture of the new building.
In his concept, architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account wider corridors, hallways and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas.
The first plans began around eight years ago, when the former US Army officer's building was put to the test for residents with a handycap: "the house had come in years and was no longer up-to-date in terms of equipment," Bader explained in retrospect.
In 2016, the excavators moved in to demolish the house.
The new building should be designed as friendly and bright as possible so that the residents can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller Opens New Residential Home
Life support invested around 4.6 million euros in the new building.
The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros, the district of Swabia 450,000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction work has remained within the planned framework - both in terms of time and money.
The managing director of Lebenshilfe, Jürgen Heinz, also thanked him for this.
The balancing act between a barrier-free and at the same time fire-proof construction method was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had set up a home with the many requirements, allowing residents to experience the freedom to move around without the help of others.
Gertrud kreutmayer, the head of the social administration of the district of Swabia, said similarly: "the house is oriented towards the special needs of its inhabitants, who need tools to be mobile."
In the process, the comfort and functionality were combined well, kreutmayer said.
And further: "the property in this location is a real stroke of luck, because it can no longer be purchased in the current situation."
In total, the new residential home in münsterblickstraße offers space for 30 people with disabilities on almost 1500 square metres, divided into three residential groups.
Heinz, Managing Director of Lebenshilfe, is proud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed according to tariff.
Germany: Schwesig complains of differences between East and West
Berlin - before the Day of Unity, the deputy leader of the SPD, Manuela Schwesig, appealed to all compatriots not to resign themselves to discrimination against East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after nearly 30 years of unity.
We must not be satisfied with these differences, "the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern told the" Tagesspiegel am Sonntag. "
The goal must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans worked longer on average than the people of West Germany, but were paid 15 percent less.
"I can't explain this to anyone almost 30 years after German unification," Schwesig said.
North Korea: does this cute dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan hunting dog is said to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to ease ties with Seoul, Pyongyang has given South Korean President Moon Jae A gift in two North Korean Pungsan hounds.
As Moon's office announced on Sunday, the two approximately one-year-old dogs reached their receiver as early as Thursday.
They passed the border town of Panmunjom along with three kilograms of dog food to "make it easier for the animals to get used to it."
The dogs with thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They are part of the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The North announced the friendship at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in mid-September.
The two countries also agreed to compete jointly in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to apply jointly for the Olympic Games in 2032.
In the course of the mutual rapprochement, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang ri test facility for rocket engines.
Austria's eventful history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months in this year of commemoration, numerous new books have been published, most of which answer this question in retrospect over the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director-general of the Austrian State Archives, puts it quite differently in the magnificent "picture book" Austria, which will be published on 1 October.
New week, new opportunity for the government
Back to work in kind - this is the unofficial motto for the grand coalition's week of work, which begins today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the chancellor and her ministers from the CDU, the SPD and also from the CSU have not recently invoked mantra for the "return to work in kind."
This may have led some tradesmen, doctors, cashiers and other working citizens in this country to ask what the real difference is between work and non-work, but be that as it may.
If the federal government is now ready to return to its mission - to govern - it should not be stopped now by discussing terms.
Whether the Union and the SPD can actually achieve something together after the provocations and blamages of the last few weeks will probably be shown by Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the governing parties meet for the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to call this round regularly to defuse conflicts early on; a lesson from all the dispute.
First of all, however, the diesel retrofits and the immigration of skilled workers act are once again on the agenda of controversial issues.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to get the car companies off lightly with Exchange premiums, SPD and CDU See the manufacturers in the duty for the technical retrofitting of older diesels.
While there has been a rapprochement in the diesel crisis over the weekend, the Union and the SPD are still far apart in the planned immigration of skilled workers act.
The SPD is calling for a stay perspective for rejected asylum seekers who are working or training.
The Union is strongly opposed to the "change of track" from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be disputes among coalition partners again - and how else?
Not immediately and immediately did the GroKo come together, but three partners, some with very different views of society and priorities.
Dispute is good.
Without controversy, a society marked by so many, sometimes contradictory, interests does not progress.
However, in order to be constructive, disputes must not be raised again for partisan reasons on the question of being or not being.
It is still about politics, not theatre.
The Union and the SPD are to argue - but always keep an eye on the reality of people's lives.
What is feasible and useful for many?
With this key question, both the diesel and the lane change question can be clarified pragmatically - and thus confidence can be regained.
Above all, that is what the people's parties must fight for now.
Mushroom checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in the sights
Does the Minister of Labour of all people violate the current right to serve?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"really day and night" had their legions worked on the social security reform, an exuberant social security minister reported at the presentation of the same two weeks ago.
In the case of List mushroom mandatarin Daniela Holzinger, the statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) is met with surprise - she is now bringing the matter to Parliament via a request.
She believes that "the minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm for the deployment of her team and not to announce violations of the current right to serve in front of cameras."
Nevertheless, she now has questions to "absolve har ­ Tinger of any suspicion."
Police tear up a street in search of woman's corpse
Marxgrün - the police did not want to comment for a long time.
Now there is a confirmation.
Steben has been dug on the state road between Naila And Bad Steben since early Saturday morning.
The track is closed in the Marxgrün area until Monday.
It was preceded by the fact that the investigators had previously set up an archaeological site.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, together with his guide, was able to limit the relevant area to a few metres in repeated use.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered in the area of the street in question, together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the top bavarian monument protection authority.
For more than a year, the district attorney's office and the Hof criminal police have been handling the missing case.
Again and again, a cycle path was blocked at Marxgrün and examined with sonar devices, because investigators suspect that here, in the course of the new construction of the state road 30 years ago, healthy bodies may have been buried.
Colour Powder and eggs: riots in Barcelona ahead of Catalonia anniversary
Monday marks the first anniversary of the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia.
But there are riots before that.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - on the eve of the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of 1 October 2017, clashes between separatists and the police have taken place in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by pro-independence activists with paint powder, among other things, as they tried to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Around 3000 officers from the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil police units wanted to pay tribute to their colleagues who were in action in the polling stations last year in what was considered an illegal referendum.
There was also violence at the time in an attempt to prevent citizens from voting.
Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and the central state security forces separate, Spanish media reported.
However, some of the 6,000 or so separatists would then have used force to try to break through the police chain, throwing paint bags and eggs at the officers, among other things.
Six people were arrested and 24 others were slightly injured, the authorities said.
Monday marks the first anniversary of the independence referendum.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to secede the wealthy region of Spain, the central government in Madrid had placed Catalonia under compulsory administration in the autumn of 2017.
The then regional president, Carles Puigdemont, fled into exile in Belgium.
Other politicians also took refuge abroad.
On the other hand, several ministers of the then Regional Government and other activists of the separatist movement remain in custody.
New elections were held in the region in December.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, the compulsory administration was terminated.
But the new regional president, Quim Torra, also insists on the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: clueless: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen split scoreless
Red-and-white Ahlen continues on the spot.
Even at FC Gütersloh, it was only enough to score a 0-0 draw.
In front of 438 spectators at the Heidewaldstadion, the closing light and the third last one turned out to be a gathering of perplexity.
The first half was manageable by the entertainment factor ARG.
Anyone who wanted to get a beer or a sausage could do so without any worries.
There was no risk of missing a goal chance, because there were virtually none.
First shot after half an hour
Gütersloh's Nick flock was responsible for the first (innocuous) goal shot of the entire match in the 28th minute.
The ahleners had the best - and in principle the only real - Option when Cihan Yilmaz forced FCG goalie Frederic westergerling to a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty area.
The hosts were even more harmless.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Striker Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, Sinan Aygün came for him.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the growing boredom.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mützel was just above the casing from 18 metres and after an hour, the Gütersloh team also made an offensive appearance for the first time.
After a shooting of Matthäus wieckowicz it was fixed.
Nick flock (62nd) "crowned" the quick-Handed Conter over Sinan Aygün with a slack shot into the arms of RWA goalie Bernd schipmann.
They also followed up with a header from wieckowicz (66th) after a corner ball from ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut responded, initially bringing Marko onucka for Martin fuhsy (60) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70).
It did - nothing.
The Ahlener did not achieve more than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative.
It wasn't until the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but neither did it.
Angelo Daut then tried to highlight the positive: "I like the fact that we played to zero," but unfortunately the zero was also at the front.
"this time we were not as dangerous to the goal as we were against Holzwickede, even though our opponent had no desire to play here," stated RW Ahlen's interim coach.
Offensively, Everything "splashed a bit" against a team that only wanted to defend.
At any rate, I didn't feel we could get a counter, "Daut said.
To his chagrin, however, viewers did not feel like his team could score a goal.
For that, the idea was too meager.
Reckenfeld Thanksgiving market: luckily there are enough kreimers
Brigitte ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler FROM THE reckenfelder tafelausstelle, for whom these donations are intended, are delighted.
The volunteers assure: "these donations also remain in Reckenfeld."
At the opening, the sky was bright blue, while the square was still a little empty, but that was to change during the day.
Because: "it's so nice to be sociable here, that's why we're here today," said one visitor.
Organizer of the Festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a good dose of humour.
For the Brockmann couple, who were supposed to be weighed up against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in at short notice.
Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has fallen ill.
But there are enough kreimers.
And the "substitute" did not allow himself to entertain the increasing number of visitors musically in between.
This was so well received that some folk songs were sung along at a late hour.
"just great," said Marcel Kreimer.
Mayor Peter vennemeyer was able to place the opening date in his schedule this time.
He is happy about the many active people with their stands, among them mostly clubs.
"actually, there should be no such thing as a blackboard," he nevertheless thanked for the action of the male choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the efforts of all those who were in action at the stands and also included the other festivals and the "Clean Up" campaign that took place in September.
Our garden town has a colourful coat of paint - there's something going on here.
The May wreath was then taken down by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire brigade and taken to the winter quarters.
Many stalls have been working for the physical well-being.
Everything was to be had from sweet to savoury.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only been living in Reckenfeld for a year, got creative on his scroll saw.
He offered veneers, beer covers with Reckenfeld motifs and much more.
Three beekeepers from Reckenfeld offered a speciality: "reckenfelder Honig," brought along by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian wedershoven and Helen Roth-buschschlüter.
The latter has a specialty.
Honey cake in a glass, of course with honey from my own production.
Little Elsa had to access it again and again, the cake tasted so good.
It is the conviviality that made the visitors linger long into the evening hours, even without a stage programme that does not exist at the Autumn Festival.
Smears with local political message: no successful advertisement for skate plant
In Lengerich, unknown people have promoted the construction of a skate facility in a hardly conducive manner.
According to Jürgen Kohne of the City Council, there are several lubricants in several places, at the request of wn.
In at least one case, a criminal complaint has been filed with the police for damage to property.
The three words "skatepark for Lengerich!" are emblazoned in large letters on signs at the gempt Hall and the Old Town Hall, among others.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that after the trade fair on 19 September, a corresponding lettering had already been discovered on the advertising poster at the stairway to the gempt bistro.
Since the short message was apparently "only" left with an Edding at the time, it could easily be removed.
"a few days later, however, this was back, this time sprayed on," says Rottmann.
He assumes that the corresponding advertising image must be replaced.
The fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the panel gives this particular case a special touch.
If the skate facility is built, its realization will also be made possible by sponsors.
There are already promises, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the municipal department of school, sport and culture, without naming names.
It is possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the plaque.
For years, local politics and administration have been dealing with the subject of skateboarding.
After the old one had been dismantled at the LWL Clinic, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
Finally, the majority of the council voted in favour of the fire service car park.
However, this request was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against a building at this point.
A U-turn followed at the end of June.
The members of the main and Financial Committee now voted unanimously for the area of the Gutenberg School.
As things stand, Jürgen Kohne says that the administration is currently in the midst of concrete planning.
The city council then has the final say.
He expects a decision to be made this year, so that a positive vote could be taken in 2019.
Air traffic control bottleneck gets worse
Frankfurt / Hamburg after the European air traffic chaos in the summer, German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement in the coming year.
"this year we had wind, in 2019 we will have strong winds and then the storm comes," Matthias Maas, Head of the Air Traffic Control Union, told the German press agency ahead of the aviation summit on 5 October in Hamburg.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight cancellations is the long-known shortage of staff at European air traffic control, for which there is no quick solution.
"airlines and airports can make rapid improvements for the coming year, but training new pilots takes four to five years," said the trade unionist.
Europe-wide, the market for fully trained pilots is vacant.
Around a hundred people were missing in the centre of Karlsruhe alone to monitor the Upper German airspace.
Maas again criticised the fact that various air transport unions were not invited to the summit.
Representatives of the federal, state, air traffic control, airlines and airports will meet in the Hanseatic city on Friday to address the causes of the delays.
"if you want to talk about additional work densification and overtime, it won't work without us," explained the head of the GDF, which has many members at the German air traffic control.
Maas once again blamed the EU commission for the lousy of pilots.
Traffic forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 have been far too low.
The resulting cost targets and personnel savings for national air traffic control systems are now fully reflected in the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to lobby in Brussels for regulations that "do not tie up the air" for air traffic control.
At the moment, the EU requirements are being agreed by 2024 and further tightening is to be feared.
The EU is under constant pressure from the airlines to lobby.
"Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown themselves in recent years," Maas said.
He hopes that the high cost of delays in airlines will lead to a rethink.
The GDF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if the German Air Traffic Control (DFS) offers a "coherent training and future Pact," Maas said.
The previously announced admission of 120 pilot pupils per year over the next five years is just enough to compensate for the age-related departures.
The necessary personnel development is not yet connected with this.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board votes in favour of group restructuring
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously in favour of the plans to rebuild the group.
According to the will of ThyssenKrupp Interim Chief Executive Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed chairman of the board at the meeting on Sunday, the kriselnde Group is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies are said to be based in Essen and listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional staff cuts beyond the already known administrative cuts.
After two resignations, the controlling body on the capital side has only eight heads.
This is opposed by ten representatives of the employees.
However, the final decision is expected to be taken by a general meeting in 2020.
The new ThyssenKrupp Materials AG is to include, among other things, the 50 percent share from the merged steel business with Indian partner Tata.
In the second company ThyssenKrupp industrials AG, the business of elevators and supplies is to be bundled.
Barcelona: violence in demonstrations by policemen and Catalan pro-independence activists.
Two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish policemen and Catalan pro-independence activists in Barcelona have seen violent clashes with numerous injured.
According to the city administration, about 3000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as about 6000 pro-independence demonstrators.
The Catalan police have tried with a large contingent to keep the two protest trains away from each other.
However, according to the volunteers, pro-independence activists repeatedly tried to break the security barrier.
They attacked the officers with paint and gunshots.
According to the information, there were also skirmishes between the participants of the various protest movements.
According to rescue workers, 24 people were injured.
Police said there were six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
With their demonstration, the police wanted to pay tribute to the colleagues who, almost exactly a year ago, had opposed the independence referendum in Catalonia, which was banned by the Spanish central government.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and Civil Guard find it unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn significantly more than they do.
The demonstrators felt it was a provocation that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona, of all places.
"why did you come here to protest?" asked 55-year-old Catalan demonstrator Manel Perez of the AFP news agency.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they spooked US a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to give his name to Daniel, dismissed the accusation.
"of course, we want to support our comrades, who only did their duty last year: to defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona because it is a big European city and there is more echo here.
However, he and his colleagues "did not come to provoke," the policeman assured.
Breakdown allowed access to personal data of UK ministers
A security loophole in a mobile phone app has meant that the personal data of ministers and Tory Tory Conservative MPs was temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unidentified people after the breakdown became known a day before the Tory party congress in Birmingham.
Two people clamped down on B217
The Hanover police report a serious traffic accident on Sunday morning on the main road 217, Hamelner Chaussee, at the exit of Wettbergen in the direction of Ronnenberg.
Two people died when they drove their car against a tree.
The car is currently in flames.
The volunteers are on site.

Football: Juve coach praises after top match: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese star striker "played the best match this evening along with half an hour of Valencia," praised Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri after the record-breaking champion's 3-1 (1-1) victory against the SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensive bought-in star was the decisive man in the important match against the pursuer, even without a goal of his own.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and is doing well," Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical errors, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from that moment on we have grown.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three goals, Juve turned the game through Dries Mertens' goal (10th minute) after the early layoff and for the time being suspended the worst pursuer.
The Real Madrid goalscorer first put on former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who provided the lead with a double pack (26th / 49th).
And Ronaldo, after a corner with a header, also did the preliminary work for the goal of defence boss Leonardo Bonucci (76.), who just had to push in just before the goal line.
"he gives a lot of templates," the coach praised.
But Allegri, of course, also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the record scorer in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
"we have to get even better at serving him," the coach demanded.
Best Juve goalscorer is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on his account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, the superiority of Juventus seems to become even more oppressive.
Seven victories in seven games is the flawless series in Serie A. At 21 points, the champion of the past seven years already has six points ahead of Naples.
The former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti coached the second place in the standings against Turin, although he was not without chances.
But at the latest after the relegation of the already warned Mario Rui (58.), the top game was decided.
The Portuguese had to step in too hard against Paulo Dybala with yellow-red off the pitch.
"we played well against a good Naples," commented the Turin coach.
Emre Can was also allowed to feel addressed.
The German National has prevailed at Juve.
The professional, who came from Liverpool FC, was involved in all seven league games.
The midfielder also played in the Championship League match against Valencia, which Allegri said was "half an hour": Ronaldo flew off the pitch in the Turin 2-0 win and is closed for Tuesday's home match against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes his name
With a particularly quirky appearance, rapper Kanye West has garnered attention at the weekend's US TV show "Saturday Night Live."
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume caused frowns and question marks among viewers.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a name change just in time for the release of his new album.
From now on, let him be called "Ye," according to the musician.
"the creature that used to be known as Kanye West," he tweeted, echoing the late singer Prince, when he dropped his stage name.
However, the pseudonym is not news.
The tenth album was released under this name.
In an interview with radio station krrl, the artist said that "Ye" had a religious meaning for him.
"I think" ye "is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means" you, "" according to the rapper.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: finally!
Done!
Hoetmar's coach averhage made no secret of his disappointment.
This was a weak game of ours today.
The opponent was simply more catchy, we almost never confronted him with any problems. "the list of Hoetmar's bullet options reads correspondingly thin.
Just two chances of scoring in 90 minutes, so it is rarely possible to make games positive.
A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0: 2 (0: 1) Photo: Heinz schwackenberg
The SG also had only two options in the first round, but Maik Krause took advantage of the early lead from a sharp angle (7th).
In the 43rd minute, Steffen uphus could have raised, but after a great preliminary work by Krause, he dangled free-standing.
The hosts only had a double chance when Moritz Höne failed to play goalkeeper Jos Schuhmacher and Jan Blome also found his champion in the sendenhorster keeper.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But uphus (49.), Julian Turl (61.) and Heinz Linnemann (69.) All gave away.
A trading Meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved with his hand on the goal line and saw red for it - Niklas EILMANN was also unable to use for the guests (75.).
It was only when Nils Berheide pushed the ball over the line that the match was decided (81.).
"we had previously criticised ourselves harshly, which was different today than in the last few weeks," was Florian Kraus's conclusion.
Sendenhorst: J. schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, EILMANN, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77th Berheide), L. Hartleif, uphus, Abu Dalal (90th Leibig), Turl.
Goals: 0: 1 Krause (7th), 0: 2 Berheide (81st).
Red CARD: Kortenjann (75. / Hoetmar).
Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: spectacular football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3: 4
"I don't know what to think of it," he said.
"we didn't get access to them at all." he probably meant the wingtongs with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also all the other green-whites who came up with a collective offensive drive.
He was still able to laugh: "a dirty victory," he said, cheekily, and moved from there to his players, on the other hand, the relief was to note that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Mind you, after a duel between two teams, one of which, Albachten, is playing for the Championship and the other, Albersloh, is fighting to maintain the class.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes behind him.
"this was by far our best performance of the season," he says.
"how we come back after 0-2, how we oppose one of the league's top teams over the entire season, that was really phenomenal."
This makes it all the more bitter that you now have to go home empty-handed.
Top goalscorer Lars Zymner put the hosts in the lead with his 12th goal of the season (24th).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for that goal.
He set the 2-0 over the left side to Fabian Fröhning (39.).
We knew that, but you can't take such a player out completely.
"that was madness, what he did," Lewandowski acknowledged the quality of the opponent without envy.
Shortly before the side change, his own eleven equalised: McGill's free-kick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper hinkerohe into the long toreck (45th).
After the side change, it was McGill again who scored the equaliser (59th).
Then it went back and forth.
It was a crisp, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64th), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann equalised (69th).
Despite an overcount, Albersloh failed to counter the last Concordia hit (80.) again.
We must now focus our full attention on Wednesday.
"the game against schapdetten, that's what we have to win now," Lewandowski said.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87. Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87. Bareksai).
Goals: 1: 0 Zymner (24.), 2: 0 Fröhning (39.), 2: 1 McGill (45.), 2: 2 McGill (59.), 3: 2 Nübel (64.), 3: 3 p. Horstmann (69.), 4: 3 jülkenbeck (80.).
Yellow-red: Atalan (74th / Albachten).
Football: TSV Straßberg wins point against Primus
There was no winner in the Regional League duel between TSV Strassberg and FV Biberach.
The leader of the table had actually come for three points, but the team of coach Oliver Pfaff was very good and the game ended 0-0.
Media: entire board of Dynamo Dresden resigned
According to media reports, the entire Presidium of Football Second League player Dynamo Dresden has resigned.
Several media outlets agreed in the evening to a joint letter from the Committee of the Saxons.
At first, there was no confirmation of the association.
The reason for the withdrawal is supposed to be internal power struggles with the former Federal League leader.
Erdogan in Germany: politics instead of pomp
It's good that he's gone again.
There are few state guests whose departure in Germany brings as much relief as that of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The Turkish president visited Berlin and Cologne for three days, and many had said that he should not have been invited at all.
Evangelical Academy Tutzing: prominent guests and new offers
The Protestant Academy in Tutzing is offering about 80 conferences by the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, France's president, Emmanuel Macron, has signaled that he wants to pick up the price of tolerance in person in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: as Federal President, he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was a guest there.
Udo Hahn, Director of the academy, credited him with saying proudly: "all federal presidents and federal chancellors have already been with us." however, the fact that celebrities repeatedly appear at the Academy in Tutzing Castle was also a topic of discussion during the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October, singer-songwriter Konstantin Wecker will take part in a conference on spiritual experience from a philosophical perspective; on 29 September, writer Frido Mann will attend a conference on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, France's president, Emmanuel Macron, has also pledged that he will personally receive the "Tolerance Prize" awarded to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which, in another category, will also be awarded to television presenter Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The roughly 80 meetings until mid-2019 have it all.
"the pension is not safe!" is written in a conference title.
"SOS on Europe's borders" - this is how the academy describes the "risky and deadly route across the Mediterranean."
"and to a meeting on Syria:" barbarity without limit. "
Arms deals, destruction, torture, death - war taunts any humane idea. "
The spectrum ranges from structural racism in society to the gap between rich and poor to radical changes in work through digitalisation.
Academy director Hahn said: "a free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to look for solutions or at least partial solutions."
At a meeting on the 200.
Karl Marx's birthday is soon to be expected by some more visitors to the direction of capitalism criticism, while others are more likely to have a tendency "from the left to the centre."
What about neutrality?
"we are 100 percent a daughter of the Protestant Regional Church," said study leader Dr. Ulrike haerendel, "so we are not 100 percent neutral."
Music cabaret: gender understanding with Hearts - Wolbeck - Westphalian News
"suitable for both adults and Men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christuskirche in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret star, Teubner imagined gender understanding, not only with humour and warmth of heart for the (felt) woman and the (felt) man and what else there might be, but also with music.
She used the mini-guitar and also mastered her violin.
Ben Süverkrüp sat at the wing.
On the one hand, he is the male sparring partner, who sometimes comes to the end of the sentence, and on the other hand he is a true pianist: Süverkrüp Teubner is so congenially harmonious that some may have wished for a solo.
This was also the case, with Beethoven and Chopin, but it was different, namely the way it suited the theme of the evening.
Teubner had brought a paradox into play: the satisfaction of the man comes when he has a partner, but she does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, does not bring any benefit.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same thing: what would have emerged from Mozart's composing if "Das Nannerl" had unexpectedly opened the door?
Thus, Süverkrüp glides over in improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt voll Blut und unde" to the "song of death," and from Mozart's Symphony in G minor to a playful dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the Association, presented flowers to the Chansonette.
But the chairman, Heidemarie markenbeck, did not let himself be taken away with an additional thank you.
She had the idea of giving the duo one in Wolbeck in addition to appearances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt.

Controversial tech billionaire Elon Musk is allowed to remain chief executive at electric car maker Tesla, but has to chair the board of directors.
Musk also agreed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to pay a double-digit million fine, the SEC said.
The background is Musk's surprise announcement in August that he plans to take Tesla off the stock market.
In its lawsuit, the SEC accused Musk of providing false and misleading information.

After a bus crash on the A5 in Baden-Württemberg, the police have slightly revised the number of victims down.
10 passengers were slightly injured instead of 15.
All have since been discharged from the hospital.
The French bus driver had stayed in hospital for one night for observation.
He will be released during the day, a spokesman for the police said.
The cause of the bus accident at Bruchsal is still unclear.
The long-distance bus crashed head-on against a guardrail on Saturday morning.
Handball: women's national league: Ahlener SG narrowly retains the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The ahlenerinnen had problems especially with third-league player Carolin Stallmann, who alone marked ten hits.
"actually, I was happy with the defence, only one player scored too many goals.
We didn't get a grip on them, "said ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more annoyed by the many missed opportunities.
His team missed the concentration in the end this time.
As a result, the ASG almost ran behind until the end, at 11: 12 at the break and later at 15: 18 (45th) at the back.
Only towards the end did the broader bank of the hosts make a decisive impact.
In addition, Aydogdu placed back room Merle Klement on the left, who then "extremely clever scored the decisive goals" (Aydogdu).
ASG: buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), pump, Exner, Klement (5), colbatzky (5 / 3), Drewes (1), schclammann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3rd League Women: top performance of BSV Ostbevern in the top match at VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyball players of BSV Ostbevern have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd League West.
The blue-and-white won 3-1 at the second-league relegation VC Allbau Essen.
"this was a huge step for a cool season.
Lenz is playing in the top third of the league.
We have now come up with this, "said head coach Dominik Münch, looking forward to an almost impeccable performance by his team in the toppled championship leader.
The first round was dominated by the guests almost at will.
About 4: 1, 16: 10 and 22: 12 he went to the runner-up of the previous year at 25: 15.
Essen has taken over in the two bars, but has not come into play.
We have kept them busy.
Our opponent has hit out at high risk, but has also produced a number of tickets.
In the second set, the BSV already led with 12: 8. "Essen switched the assumption to three bars.
We could not keep the impact pressure.
Food has sucked in, and we have let ourselves be lulled a bit, "Münch continued.
At 18: 17, the volleyball players from the Ruhr region had their nose in front for the first time.
Ostbevern fought off four set balls at 19: 24, but the fifth attempt found its goal.
"the game was now a class better," said the head of the practice at the rising level.
Maike rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed significantly to the BSV turning the sheet from 14: 16 to 25: 21 In the third section.
Münch: "we played consistently and calmly."
Over 7: 3 and 15: 13, the blue-and-white passageway brought four to their side with 25: 22.
Vera Horstmann was chosen as the most valuable player, but Maren flachmeier also had an excellent day.
BSV women: eggenhaus, rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish community: mosque opening as Missed Opportunity
The Turkish Community in Germany (TGD) has criticised the way in which Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan inaugurated the great DITIB mosque in Cologne.
"the opening of the mosque in Cologne has left a pile of shards in German-Turkish relations, which can only be painstakingly swept together," said the chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, the editorial network Germany.
Both the Turkish and German sides had missed the chance to make a joint, conciliatory appearance.
"instead of side by side with German leaders underlining Muslims" affiliation with Germany, Erdogan used the date for his purposes, "Sofuoglu lamented.
The extensive exclusion of the German public has "reinforced many reservations."
Home Association Nottuln: offer has already been established
After the long summer break, folktreff time is finally back.
On 18 October (Thursday) at 7.30 pm, the Nottuln local association is already holding its fifth nottulner folktreff in the Fireplace Room of the old officialdom.
Almost to the day, it's been a year since we first held a folktreff.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln, "says Hanns Moormann, chairman of the nottulner Heimatverein.
I would not have thought that our folk meeting would take place so quickly in Nottuln.
Regardless of whether storm-deep Friederike in January or heatwave in July, the fireside room of the officialdom was always fully occupied.
"the programme at the next folktreff is, as always, a colourful mix of German folk, wandering and sailor songs, folk songs, evergreens and old hits," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who keeps inviting friendly musicians to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer has promised to play his accordion for the first "birthday" of folk music.
For many years he was a member of "gaitling," a group from the neighbouring district of Steinfurt that played music with low German lyrics.
Now he's out with an Irish folk band.
The organisers of the folktreff are happy to recall the last event in the summer, when Christoph Schulz from the folktreff Emsdetten enthused the audience with his international version of the song "frogs at Night" and sent them home with an earworm.
"we expect a lot of cheerful guests to spend a convivial and humorous evening once again," the Home Association's invitation states.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to play an active role is invited to join in.
Since the sought-after seats are always quickly occupied, it is recommended to be there early enough.
The folktreff starts at 7.30pm, but the entrance is already at 7pm.
China approves proposed merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October.
Frankfurtlinde and Praxair are taking another step forward on their way to becoming the world's largest industrial gas company.
The Chinese Competition Authority has approved the proposed merger, Linde announced on Sunday.
This means that the multi-billion-dollar merger will still face approvals in South Korea and - as the biggest hurdle - in the USA.
Most recently, according to an insider, the chances of obtaining approval there had improved because Linde had promised to sell additional parts of the company.
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October in order for the merger to succeed.
From pure fruit production to ecology
A gala in the dr.-stammberger-Halle marked the 125th anniversary of the district association for horticulture and landscaping.
On 29 September 1893, a fruit show in the Kulmbach Club House provided the last impetus for the foundation of the district association for horticulture and state care Kulmbach, and exactly 125 years later, on Saturday evening, he celebrated a big anniversary in the Kulmbach Town Hall.
At the time, however, he was still called differently: as the "district building association Kulmbach Stadt und Land," he was christened by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit-growing association also differed from today's work - it was actually purely about fruit-growing, at the time nobody thought about flowers and horticulture.
"at that time, in the Age of Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favourite child of the elites," explained district healer Günter Dippold in his keynote speech.
Fruit trees were to line long-distance roads, and so-called industrial gardens were created in schools.
Fruit-growing is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7000 members.
But the spectrum is far from exhausted.
Horticulture close to nature, biological plant protection, village beautification and nutrition play an equally important role as conveying knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The members of the hutschdorf youth group "moles" showed on stage how versatile the tasks of a horticultural association are.
"youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said District Chairman Günter Reif, and also whether Henry Schramm stressed how important experiences in nature are for life.
Collecting chestnuts was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that smartphone & Co. can be used to collect a similar amount of joy.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with district administrator Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"the district association decides where they should stand," added District Administrator Söllner, highlighting the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.
The district association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green spaces in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district also left District Manager and Consultant Friedhelm Haun no doubt about it.
He led the many visitors through the long history of the district association with a lecture and reported among other things on the necessity of self-sufficiency after the war.
Everything used to come out of the garden, for the winter it was dosed.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the commercial garden turned into an ornamental and residential garden.
"nature has endured, it was there before us and we have to follow it," the expert for fruit and nut trees pleaded.
That is why there is an incentive for the horticultural associations not to let up, so that our homeland remains beautiful and worth living.
This includes welcoming the new citizens to our clubs, added Wolfram Vaitl, president of the Bavarian State Association.
"we have to stop the flagrant decline in insects, we owe it to our children and grandchildren," concluded Günter Reif, who was ceremonially framed by the turmbläsern OF THE Thurnau Music Club.

Priority on NAFTA talks: Canada's foreign minister resigns UN speech
Mexico's government wants clarity on NAFTA: they are giving both trading partners an ultimatum to reach an agreement.
Canada's foreign minister is now giving absolute priority to the trade agreement - postponing her speech to the United Nations.
Because of the time pressure in the struggle for a new version of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the USA and Mexico, the Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of this Saturday, the minister will not speak before the General Assembly of the United Nations until Monday, her spokesman Adam Austen announced.
In the meantime, it is focusing on the renegotiation of NAFTA.
Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Friday that negotiators from Canada and the United States would have 48 hours to agree if Canada actually wanted to join the trade agreement already struck between its country and the United States.
The U.S. and Mexico agreed in August to rewrite the regional Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
U.S. President Donald Trump hinted that Canada could be barred from NAFTA in the future.
Talks on a new edition have been going on for over a year.
They are due to be completed by Sunday evening (local time), with Trump's administration planning to submit the agreement to the U.S. Senate before October 1.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico's president-elect Andres Manuel López Obrador announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidate Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, injured in a knife attack, has left the hospital.
The far-right ex-military wanted to fly to Rio de Janeiro, where he lives, according to a report by the daily newspaper "O Globo."
After his dismissal, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will make public appearances in the South American country last week before the presidential election.
The politician was attacked on the street in early September during a campaign event in southern Brazil.
Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele Not" (in German: "der nicht"), women's associations in particular had called for protests against the ex-military.
On social networks, too, the associations mobilized against Bolsonaro's racist and misogynistic statements.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In the capital, Brasilia, the protests were mixed with a rally by Fernando Haddad, the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers "Party (PT).
He replaced ex-President Inácio Lula da Silva, who was sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and is therefore not allowed to run.
The presidential election in Brazil is on October 7.
As the ex-mayor of the city of São Paulo, Haddad has been far behind the far-right candidate Bolsonaro in polls so far.
The "Trump of Brazil" has been involved in politics for a long time, but now presents itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates reach an absolute majority in the first round of voting, there will be a runoff on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge from it successfully - no matter who he competes against.
Bolsonaro is known for inciting against homosexuals and blacks and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Again and again, he is shocked by verbal derailments.
Another time, he said the supporters of Lula's left-wing Workers "Party should be shot.
Europe reclaims Ryder Cup title
Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines - just an hour from Disneyland, European golfers have written another Ryder Cup fairytale just outside Paris.

After a long illness: Danish rock legend has died
Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen announced on Larsen's website.
At the deathbed, Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician had been in treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become known with the band Gasolin, which was enormously successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Her songs were influenced by international music greats such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and The Beatles.
After the dissolution of the band in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold around three million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album "Midt om natten" is still the best-selling album in Denmark.
Danish Prime Minister Lars lökke Rasmussen paid tribute to Larsen in a statement on Sunday as a "street boy" who was "against everything but in all hearts."
The head of the government also recalled that in 2010, the opponent of the monarchy, Larsen, appeared on the occasion of the 70th birthday of the Danish Queen Margrethe II.
Rock night at the shoe factory: volume at compressed air hammer level
"here we stand, take the bone saw and light a concert evening with the power of a tiger." the band names of "here we stand," "Tiger Bonesaw" and "the ignition" alone suggest such a paraphrase of the rocking live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Citizens "Centre Schuhfabrik: Hardrock PUR from three other friendly bands.
After the sound check and shortly before the start of the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There is no trace of stage fright.
After that, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in conjunction with the booking agency "mosquito" from Oelde - and their bands will clearly delight the 120 or so visitors to the "MINT mosquito" Rock Night.
The quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis hadrika already knows how to convince at the start of the concert evening with the latest, unknown pieces from his own pen and the forthcoming CD.
In front of the stage, the performance is accompanied by a harmonious and powerful interplay of the band.
Although "Encore" shouts cannot be overheard, "Tiger Bonesaw" will then leave the stage to the trio "here we stand."
Guitarist Sascha bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher demonstrate that Hardrock is not the same as Hardrock with their alternative sounds, sometimes reminiscent of classic rock from the 1970s.
After the "high energy rock" of the "tigers," "here we stand" also uses a synthesizer in addition to the guitar rock.
It's not just the yearning, almost ballad-like "Take Me Home" that impresses with the change from melodic passages to the guitar-heavy rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" from tönnishäuschen has, however, gained a special reputation since its founding in 2005.
Full of agility, the band will present their Hard Rock on Saturday.
The fact that "the ignition" has special stage experience with its performances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the 2017 Tour in China - is obvious and unmistakable.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann, in collaboration with the band, also sets his own accents for the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by cameo from the 80 "s.
In the meantime, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a highly acclaimed solo to the sound that feels even higher than before, running through the audience.
A certain volume is a natural part of this kind of hard rock concert: at the "MINT mosquito" rock night, according to the mixing desk team, the three-piece concert of "here we stand," "Tiger Bonesaw" and "the ignition" is about 98 decibels.
This is, for example, at the level of compressed air, but is still significantly below the controls of the "Wacken festival," which "the ignition" points to on its website.
Deafening 120 decibels in jet-rib volume, as is common with the annual Metal Rendezvous in the north of the Republic, the Ahlen audience does not need it on this rock night.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocking style have long since convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso playing and their own compositions.
"here we stand, have taken the bone saw and ignited a concert evening with the power of a tiger," all three groups, admittedly figuratively, can say at the end.
And above all, enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

A dead man in glider accident at Essen / Mülheim airport
There has been a fatal accident at Mülheim / Essen airport.
A glider crashed in a car park at Mülheim / Essen airport on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
A fatal accident occurred on Sunday near Mülheim / Essen airport.
As reported by the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung," a glider had crashed on the exhibition space at the airport.
The pilot was killed.
As the "WAZ" continues to report, the flight student was on board alone - the plane is said to be a one-seater.
The plane was already landing at the time of the accident.
The crash site is only a short distance from a marquee on the airport grounds.
But an Oktoberfest has been taking place since this weekend.
Mülheim / Essen airport is located on the city limits of the two cities in the Ruhr area and directly at the entrance to the motorway 52.
From the parking lot there is a Park & Ride offer at major events at the Essen Fair or the GRUGA hall in Essen.
Trump heaves Kim: "and then we fell in love"
It is no secret that the US president of North Korea, Kim, is well-disposed despite the nuclear crisis.
But now Trump has made a real declaration of love to his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters."
At the tender age of 72, the married US President has committed himself to a new flame.
The tragedy: it's a long-distance relationship.
In public, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday.
In front of supporters in the US state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the Pyongyang ruling dynasty's half-old offspring, although it is proving to be a rather tenuous chunk in the struggle for North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
"I was tough, he too, and between us it went back and forth," Trump reported.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And it's not just the talks with Kim that have made his heart melt.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection has also borne political fruit: Trump referred to the halt of all nuclear and missile tests announced by Kim, even if critics see little more than lip service.
The US president seemed well aware that the affection for the infamous "Rocket Man" - Trump's nickname for Kim - is not likely to be for everyone.
In any case, he immediately anticipated the expected criticism of his appearance in a large sports hall in the town of wheeling: "Donald Trump says they fell in love."
How terrible, how terrible is it?
This is so unpresidential.
But he doesn't care much, Trump explained, and then pointed his finger at the crowd: "I've always told you it's so easy to be presidential."
But then there wouldn't be 10,000 people out there pushing into this jam-packed arena, we'd only have 200 people out there.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler is well-attended, atmospheric and, on top of that, spoiled by the Sun: Baesweiler's city centre was plastered on Sunday with a very varied and good dose of Oktoberfest flair.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest did not just take place in the marquee at the fire station, but was extended to the city by the Trade Association on Sunday.
Refugees rescued from Libyan prison thanks to video
Nigerian refugees have pointed out their catastrophic conditions of detention in Libya with the help of a mobile phone video, thus enabling their rescue.
The group filmed the recording in their cell in the coastal town of sawija in July at risk of life and spread it online.
"they refuse to send us back," one man said in the video message.
We are suffering here, we are dying here.
The recording was sent to the France 24 Observers website, whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were eventually flown out to Nigeria at the end of August.
"without the video, we would not have been able to return to Nigeria," EFE Onyeka, who recorded the video, told AFP news agency.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya in an attempt to cross the Mediterranean into Europe.
According to his own statement, he put himself at risk of life with the video.
One of his colleagues was almost beaten to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
In general, the conditions of detention were catastrophic: "they beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They didn't give us anything to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organises the voluntary repatriation of refugees stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria have been sent back to their homes this year through the program, said IOM spokesman in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the Nigerians who have now been rescued is not exceptional in view of the poor conditions of detention in Libya.
However, he has not heard of a call for help via mobile phone video.
International organizations have long criticized the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps as inhumane.
The North African state, which is largely dominated by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on their way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the local elementary school on Sunday afternoon to prepare her lessons for Monday, she surprised a burglar.
Around 4: 50 p.m., the teacher entered the building via the main entrance.
In the 1st floor porch, she saw a man fleeing immediately.
First through a door, then via the roof terrace and from there via a staircase to the ground floor or forecourt.
The teacher informed the police who started the investigation.
It is not yet possible to say whether things or money have been stolen.
Description of the perpetrator: about 16 years old, black, very short hair, slightly darker appearance, dark trousers, dark T-shirt.
Please contact the Obernberg Police Department at the Inn, phone number 059 133 4244.
German was trapped in his own car for days
A 75-year-old has had to endure several days and nights in his car in a wooded area in central Franconia after he stuck the car off all the forest tracks and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescue workers accidentally spotted the car near a pasture on Saturday afternoon and freed the man who had been missing since Tuesday evening, police announced on Sunday.
According to the information, the 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was in good health despite the cold nights and the long period of absence of care.
He said he was now looking forward to his home.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after he failed to return from a ride on his off-road vehicle across local meadows and fields on Tuesday.
Despite intensive search, the whereabouts of the man remained unclear for days.
Laschet urges rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU), speaking with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has called for the rule of law in Turkey, according to his own statement.
The two countries "relations are currently" overshadowed, "Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne airport.
This applies above all to waves of arrests, freedom of the press and freedom of religion.
He has therefore "made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalise in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this."
According to Laschet, he also referred to the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey.
He expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
As a result, Erdogan once again stressed the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been moved at short notice to a building of the Federal Ministry of Defence's willingness to fly at Cologne airport.
Originally, it was supposed to take place at Schloss Wahn - but the castle owners had rejected it out of political conviction against Erdogan.
After the conversation, Erdogan travelled on to the opening of the DITIB mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said: "the Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their point of contact - and not the Turkish president.
Lack of confidence in the US: North Korea calls for disarmament
While US President Trump does not tire of emphasizing the success of North Korea's denuclearization negotiations, the East Asian regime is more sober.
Secretary of State Ri is calling for Washington to come forward.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, has accused the US government at the UN General Debate of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula with its continuing sanctions.
"the latest stalemate is because the US is relying on coercive measures that are deadly to confidence-building," Ri said in New York.
In these circumstances, disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea.
"without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in such circumstances, there is no way that we are the first to disarm ourselves," the North Korean chief diplomat said.
That punitive measures could "bring North Korea to its knees" is "a dream of people who don't know us."
However, to build confidence, his country stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, RI pointed out.
However, there had been no "corresponding reactions" from the US side, the minister criticised.
Because of North Korea's nuclear and missile program, the U.N. Security Council decided three times last year alone to impose sanctions on the internationally isolated country.
Us President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have pushed for strict compliance with the sanctions at the United Nations in recent days.
At the same time, the US government is working towards rapprochement.
In June, Trump first met North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US president is aiming for a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is scheduled to return to Pyongyang for talks on ending North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
Hot served: new kitchen with donations from the community
The many visitors to the open house hot didn't notice that they were actually in a youth meeting: white blankets and floral decorations on the tables and a large buffet were waiting for the guests after the Thanksgiving service.
The young people of the hot had conjured up the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank with the food.
The launch of the new facility was not easy, as Henriette westbuer, the head of the hot, recalls.
We had already filled our fridges with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then, on the first day after the summer break, the bad surprise came: a power outage had put the huge, two-piece fridge out of service, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"now we had to start from scratch: we got a lot of support from friends and neighbours, but the children and young people wanted to make it on their own," said westbuer.
And so they all took part.
The result was impressive, the guests were delighted.
"cooks can't do better either," one visitor praised impressed, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were allowed to use quiche, liver cheese or cake.
"it's really great what the children and young people have put on their feet," said Parish priest Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan lammen caused amazement with card Ricks and other tricks.
Jürgen Sator leaves the NRW State Board of the blackboard
The head of the Essener Tafel, Jörg Sartor, has left his post in the Regional Association out of frustration with criticism from his own ranks.
Sartor had become well-known nationwide because the Essener Tafel had introduced a reception stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned as deputy head of the NRW boards in July, Sartor told the "Welt am Sonntag."
There are too many of them in my back.
Wolfgang Weilerswist, head of the Tafeln Regional Association of North Rhine-Westphalia, expressed his understanding of the decision of his long-standing deputy to the DPA.
Sartor took the sharp criticism with him.
"I can understand his move - people have spoken out who didn't know exactly why the Essen table does it."
However, Sartor is still active for the Essen panel - "six days a week, nothing changes," says Weilerswist.
In the "Welt am Sonntag," Sartor again criticised colleagues from other panels.
One should not take the approach, "without us, the people in the city are starving."
It is the responsibility of the state to ensure that people do not starve.
The Essener did not attend a conference of the panels on Friday in Berlin.
"I'm told too much sweet smack," he said.
There are all the social fuzzis that criticised me so much at the time.
SF Lorch miss 2-0 lead - Gmünder Tagespost
Football, district league Lorch loses 2: 3 against Neuler - TV hypocrites win in Kirchheim after arrears - Bettringen beat Lauchheim clear.
With 2: 0 Lorch was already in the lead in the home game against TV Neuler - in the end it was 2: 3 And the disappointment with the sports friends was great.
The TV hypocrites are very different: in Kirchheim, the TVH quickly fell behind with 0: 1, but after 90 minutes it won with 2: 1. In the meantime, the SGB was able to top the table with a 3: 0
Gladbach squandered two-time lead - Schalke without Embolo with first win
Borussia Mönchengladbach has to wait for an away win in Wolfsburg.
At 2: 2, the foals miss a lead twice.
Schalke wins the first victory of the season against Mainz (1: 0).
(SDA) four times in the first five league games, Schalke has outmaneuvered himself with early goals.
Now the team of Domenico Tedesco has once again demonstrated the strength with which it took the first place behind the Bavarians last season.
Alessandro Schöpf led the home team in the eleventh minute after a strong preparatory work by Yevgeny konopljanka, and the hosts subsequently preserved the mini-pole with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund is now greeting from the top of the Bundesliga.
Lucien Favre's team trailed a 0-2 gap against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but came to a 4-2 victory in the second half.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65.) and Marco Reus (69.) equalised with a doublet within four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was substituted by Favre in the 63rd minute, provided with another doublet in the closing phase (86. / 94.) for the crowning conclusion of the performance increase after the break.
VfB Stuttgart also came to the first victory.
Against Werder Bremen, which had already been decimated before the break because of a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic, the Stuttgart team had to fear in the meantime.
Borna Sosa and inattentive goalie Ron-Robert Zieler fabricated a curious throw-in own goal that helped the guests equalise in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a completely successful, but also a failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbach players with the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang gave twice a lead, ultimately played 2: 2 and have been waiting for an away victory in the VW city since 2003.
Renato Steffen and his second Federal Ligator were responsible for Wolfsburg's equalisation to 1: 1.
In the flat shot from 20 metres of the Aargauer, Yann Sommer was powerless, as was the second goal after an hour.
Nevertheless, the trends at Gladbach are promising.
Alassane Pléa is increasingly proving to be a goalkeeper in the storm of foals.
Against Wolfsburg, the French record-breaking purchase from OGC Nice hit for the third time in a row and for the seventh time in the seventh mandatory match.
After seven laps, Gladbach finished in 4th place.
Within 40 minutes, the previously unbeaten Werder Bremen manoeuvred against VfB Stuttgart in an uncomfortable position.
After 19 minutes, the team of Florian kohlfeldt was surprised by a Stuttgart counter, which the ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis completed with his first goal of the season. After 36 minutes, Milos Veljkovic continued to join his team: the 23-year-old Serb took yellow-red after a Jersey win against Daniel didacvi.
Admittedly, Stuttgart's defenders Borna Sosa and goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Bremen team back into the game through a curious throw-in owner (68th), and a quarter of an hour before the end, Gonzalo Castro shot the numerous Stuttgart players back onto the road to victory.
Nuremberg won the duel against Düsseldorf 3-0 confidently.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens brought the home team on course by means of a Foulpenalty.
Macedonians vote on new state names
In Macedonia today, around 1.8 million citizens are voting on whether to change the name of their country in northern Macedonia.
A Yes vote could resolve the nearly three-decade-long conflict with neighbouring Greece.
Athens had insisted on a change of name because of its northern province of the same name and blocked any rapprochement between Macedonia and the West.
Voters are therefore also deciding on the future of Western integration.
The USA had announced that the country could quickly become a member of NATO if the referendum had a positive outcome.
Syrians in custody.
Refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian brutally beat three retirees, causing them some serious injuries.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker had randaged in The Escape Lane in Alsergrund at around 10pm on Friday.
When the policemen arrived, they spoke to the accused, who started with clenched fists on passers-by and tried to attack them, about his behaviour.
The Syrian then tried to beat and kick the officers.
A short time later, it emerged that the suspect had knocked three elderly ladies (65, 67, 75) to the ground with his fists at a tram stop just a short while earlier in the street.
In addition, he had kicked the trio with his feet.
Some of the retirees were seriously injured.
They suffered hematoma, bruises and concussions.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured "for unknown reasons," as the police said.
He was taken to hospital and monitored throughout the treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly one year after the marriage for all came into force, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave themselves the "yes" vote in Hamburg on Saturday.
A registered partnership was out of the question for her, Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper.
"when we get married, it's right." he has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budget spokesman for the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokespersons for the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
Kahrs caused a stir in the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals on 30 June 2017 with a speech of rage.
He had accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of "stumbling" on the subject.
"that was her Schabowski moment," he said, alluding to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples have been able to marry just like heterosexuals.
Before that, they had been able to register their civil partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example with the right of adoption.
Garden day: 400 metres of hedge cut
There was a lot of work in front of the members of the Kinderhaus civic association and the leprosy society.
Around 400 metres of hedges around the gardens of the residents of the Pfründnerhaus were to be cut.
Supported by the residents, around twelve supporters went to work.
"we are doing this in order to reduce costs," explained the Chairman of the citizens "association, Walter Schröer.
And there have been a lot of things that have accumulated.
Due to the hot summer, we are late this time, but thankfully it is now just a form cut.
This is because the hedge has already been shaved in the spring.
The breakfast that follows the work has also been a long tradition.
"everyone should stay with their strength," said Walter Schröer.
World Cup in Rio: Hannes Aigner wins gold at the World Cup in canoe slalom
Hannes Aigner from Augsburg has won the gold medal at the end of the World Cup in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old made a perfect run on the Olympic track on Sunday.
Two years ago, he had missed Olympic bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well prepared, I already had enough rides here at the facility and everything was fine today, "said the London Olympic third in 2012.
At the finish, he threw his paddle away with joy and raised both arms to victory - knowing full well that it would be enough for at least one medal.
After all, he had start number four.
But the six remaining starters could not top his fabulous time of 89.69 seconds.
The Czech Jiri prskavec finished second in front of the Russian Pawel Eigel.
The Gauting Police Inspectorate reports the first attempt to break into a single-family home this autumn.
Thankfully, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - burglars want to take advantage of that again.
The Gauting Police Inspectorate yesterday reported the first attempt at burglary this autumn.
The alarm system is to thank for the fact that it remained at the single-family house on Königswieser Straße during the trial.
It kicked off when the perpetrators laid hands shortly before 8pm on Friday.
The burglars suspected that the residents were not at home.
The alarm system, however, apparently surprised them to such an extent that they fled without loot.

Bankruptcy at Hertha: caught up in reality: Bayern challenged against Ajax
The predicate is unbeatable: the defeat in Berlin is something FC Bayern "don't want to let go."
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim result for the tenure of Niko Kovac.
The first small performance model under the new coach Niko Kovac is not intended to increase to the greater autumn depth for the Munich team.
"a week ago, we still had the impression that we were invincible.
Now reality has caught up with us a bit, "Thomas Müller noted after the deserved 0-2 defeat at Hertha BSC and called for a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us knows that this really annoys us and that is why we are heading for Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year away, no goal of their own was scored, as at the same time of the pre-season two mandatory matches in series without a victory, the championship lead in the Bundesliga for the time being lost to Borussia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation is far from as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record holder must be warned.
The FC Augsburg at 1: 1 with its laugh-intensive man-against-man tactics and the Berliners through their playful needles over the outside have delivered two blueprints within three days, as the last seemingly overpowering Bayern are to be cracked.
"those who know FC Bayern know that we will not let this happen and we will do everything we can to ensure that we are successful again," Kovac stressed.
Apart from that, however, he dealt surprisingly gently with his losers in his native city and only pushed his first defeat as a Munich coach to the once again inadequate handling of chances.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless leave the first interim result of his term in office positive before the national break - otherwise the tone is likely to get worse.
For example, Kovac did not take any exceptional measures before the second premier class appearance of this season after the 2-0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the free day on Sunday, the short preparation for the second preliminary round match against Ajax begins as planned, which at the start AEK had also defeated Athens with 3: 0.
"now it has caught us in two games, but we will also score our goals again," announced national team captain Manuel Neuer.
As after the lost Cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place, Joshua Kimmich in particular spoke plainly.
The right-hander appeared in the role as a Mahner.
"I don't think it's all bad luck, we have to work it out again because we don't make the variety of chances and make the mistakes behind," the 23-year-old insisted shortly before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, the Bavarians were already five points behind Dortmund, which has now taken the lead with one point advantage.
And so, with a twinkle in his eye, Kimmich was at least positive that the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bayern has now come to an end.
"yes, that's a good thing," said The National.
It's already good for the league.
DFB boss in firing line: Özil-causa: Erdogan's sharp attack on Grindel
With serious allegations, Turkish President Erdogan denounces the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the line of the association.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - on different stages, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the sovereignty of interpretation in the long-term dispute of Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish president strongly criticised the handling of the ex-world champion in Germany at the opening of the great DITIB mosque in Cologne, the DFB head defended the association line.
Early on Sunday morning, the Grindel IN THE ZDF- "sportstudio" in Mainz, who was personally attacked by Özil, announced consequences from the causa.
"in the future - because we also have a lot of immigrant players in the U-teams - we must draw very precise conclusions that this is not happening again," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migration background as another integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel reiterated that Erdogan did not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
He had strongly denounced racism towards Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Mesut Özil, born and raised in Germany, and our Ilkay.
They have excluded them from this society because they have been photographed with me in England, "Erdogan said in the cathedral city on Saturday.
To be honest, as your President, I could not digest the fact that our two young men, who have joined the German national team, were excluded.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that, unlike Özil, he felt "sensibly treated by the DFB" after the World Cup affair, which began with photos of the two of them with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced that he would face players in the future.
That someone says: if I win, I'm German, if I lose, I'm a migrant - that's not possible.
"I am very sorry that he has such an impression," Grindel said.
We should have defended Mesut more, I have always said.
However, he does not see any basis for Özil's return to the national team.
As a consequence, an additional integration officer will be appointed alongside the Brazilian-born Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon.
"if someone without a migrant background has a clear impact on society and football and says," the issue is important, we have to take care of it, "that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground, where integration must work," said Grindel.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, he plans to run for office as DFB president again next year.
"I do my job and I try to do it as well as I can," Grindel said.
Year-old builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg / Rödental - police report that the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10am and 1pm.
At first, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red light in the area of louder altitude.
She told the pensioner that he had been driving against her car.
However, there was no exchange of personnel, as the 75-year-old was unable to find the lady in the car park.
A short time later, police received a telephone message about a motorist who had come off the road and driven against a control post.
When asked about this, the man did not want police on the ground and then drove off.
After that, the rödentaler drove home.
However, the pensioner has gone through procedures in his place of residence, where he has lived for decades, and has rammed a construction vehicle when turning.
Finally, the police were able to find and stop him.
His car suffered significant accident damage.
The 75-year-old made a confused impression and couldn't remember much.
The damage is around 1300 euros.
Moorbrand in Meppen: almost 1000 volunteers are still in use.
Around four weeks after the outbreak of the moor fire on a federal Defence site in Emsland, 980 emergency personnel are still engaged in the extinguishing work.
The Bundeswehr announced this on Sunday.
As the situation continues to develop in a stable manner, according to a spokesman, 70 volunteers were last withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of emergency personnel is planned, it says.
On the night of Sunday, an overground fire had been discovered and extinguished.
Last week, the disaster was lifted, which was declared a good week earlier on 21 September, because it was feared that the flames would put adjacent forests and settlements at risk by wind and flying sparks.
It was then said Thursday that the fire would no longer threaten to spill over into neighbouring communities.
At times, more than 1500 volunteers tried to control the large fire on site.
The Air Force continues to support the work on the Bundeswehr test site at Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with drones from the Bundeswehr.
According to the Bundeswehr, reconnaissance flights with "tornadoes" are also planned for October 2 and 5.
The fire was triggered by test missiles fired by Airbus technicians.
The smoke flag of the moorbrand had at times moved up to a hundred kilometres across north-west Germany as far as Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr plans to set up a point of contact to receive claims.
Initial claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, R) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Katharinen in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly one year after the marriage for all came into force, the politician married his long-time friend in Hamburg.
The two have been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - almost exactly one year after the marriage for all came into force, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave themselves the "yes" vote in Hamburg on Saturday.
A registered partnership was out of the question for her, Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper.
When we get married, it's right.
He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budget spokesman for the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokespersons for the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
Kahrs caused a stir in the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals on 30 June 2017 with a speech of rage.
He had accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of "stumbling" on the subject.
"that was her Schabowski moment," he said, alluding to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples have been able to marry just like heterosexuals.
Before that, they had been able to register their civil partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example with the right of adoption.
Referendum in Macedonia on new state names started
In Macedonia, the highly anticipated referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Around 1.8 million voters are to decide whether their state should be called Northern Macedonia in the future.
This is what neighbour Greece insists on because of its northern province of the same name.
As a means of exerting pressure, Athens had blocked any rapprochement between Skopje and the EU and NATO for almost three decades.
If the citizens vote yes, they will also give the go-ahead for the Western integration of their country.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saves the Shoah from oblivion
Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel would have turned 90 on September 30.
The 1986 Nobel Peace Prize winner dies in the US in 2016, leaving behind a work that conserves the horror of the Shoah for posterity.
Switzerland launches Electronic Register for organ donors
The register is designed to facilitate organ donation and relieve family members in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can continue to be removed only with explicit consent, emphasizes Swisstransplant.
(DPA) Switzerland is launching an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This should facilitate organ donation and relieve family members in stressful situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes can then be retrieved from Swisstransplant if necessary.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can still be removed - as in Germany - only with explicit consent, emphasizes Swisstransplant.
It is assumed that 15 percent of Swiss people have a donor card, says Franz immer, director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of cases will a card be found at the crucial moment with potential donors.
In more than 60 percent of the talks, relatives do not know the wish of the deceased.
"they then have to decide on behalf of the deceased, which is often very burdensome," he said.
There is already a similar registration system in the UK.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information on possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokeswoman for the Federal Centre for Health Education, Marita Völker-Albert, says.
"there is no register where people can register their wishes - for or against organ donation," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has spoken out in favour of a new regulation of organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would initially be considered an organ donor, unless he or her relatives disagree.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old pupil is world champion in head arithmetic
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro iseda from Japan is a world champion in head arithmetic.
He won against 39 competitors at the weekend in Wolfsburg.
This was announced by Martina Flamme-Jasper from the Phaeno Science Museum, the venue for the competition, on Sunday.
16-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany finished third.
The youngest World Cup contestant was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, the oldest a 74-year-old pensioner from France, chief referee Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organises the competition every two years.
Previous tasks, for example: 14,130 214 x 17,981,822 or 57,809,355 + 28 x 16,448,333.
As spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, where participants competed against guests from the audience with calculators.
Wenzel Grüß from Lastrup demonstrated how he keeps a ball with his head in the air when calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
In total, 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Two years ago, as a 14-year-old at the time, Grüß was present in Bielefeld.
Organiser Laue has little to do with terms such as Superbrain, genius or prodigy.
"head arithmetic can be trained," he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even stadia-oriented computer competitions.
One of the disciplines is, for example, square root drawing from six-figure figures.
When calculating versatility, candidates are given surprise tasks, for which they must quickly find a solution strategy.
The Germans would also have a good chance of doing this, said the main referee.
Apart from that, Asians are often in the advantage, because in early childhood, head arithmetic is learned more intensively and with other, effective methods.
Haunting appeal: video with naked Serena Williams: it's about breast cancer screening
Tennis ace Serena Williams shows off her soulful and sensitive side.
With this video, the 37-year-old wants to point to breast cancer and make a strong case for early detection.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings topless the song "I Touch Myself" by the group "The Divinyls" - only her hands cover her most intimate parts.
Singer Chrissy Amphlett has died from it.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project, which is about breast cancer screening, which can save lives.
Serena Williams herself would have died almost a year ago.
There were complications in the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia.
An emergency operation has been launched to save the baby's life.
In a subsequent CT, blood clumps were discovered in Serena's lungs.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The federal government plans to significantly extend the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the turquoise-blue coalition will send a corresponding bill on the so-called "symbols act" under review.
The aim is to significantly increase the number of terrorist or similar groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings fresh snow to the mountains in the West
Ms Holle shakes out her beds for the first time in the West next week: polar cold air reaches Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to meteorologists at the Central Institute of Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit drops to 1,500 to 1,200 metres at the start of the week - in narrow valleys it can snow down to about 1,000 metres at high intensity, it said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern mountains, 20 to 40 centimetres of fresh snow can be expected above 2,000 metres.
On higher-lying pass roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße), road conditions are therefore becoming wintry.
Farmers are allowed to start annual knee Care on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers are allowed to start their annual Knick Care on Monday.
The "green ramparts," unique in Germany, have shaped the landscape of the Federal State of waldarme for around 200 years.
The tree and shrub hedges, which are up to five metres wide, are "forest replacement" and for many animals and plants the last retreat rooms.
As corridors, Knicks connect scattered habitats through which the exchange of organisms can still function, said Ingo ludwichowski, Managing Director of the German Nature Conservation Association (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein.
Knicks are Living Fences
The Knicks were created on the orders of the Danish King Christian VI in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "Living Fences" were not only a field boundary and a cattle fence, they also provided the farmers with firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.
His name "Knick" also comes from that time: the dense, intertwined demarcations could develop by "bending" the branches.
Today, around 45,000 kilometres of hedges stretch between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, giving the picture of a wooded, multifaceted landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used by around 7000 animal species as a replacement habitat.
Up to 1800 different species could live in one kilometre of knick and up to 30 pairs of birds could breed.
However, The Knick can only fulfil its ecologically important function if it is properly cared for in winter.
Otherwise it atrophies to a light row of trees, which, in addition to biodiversity, also loses the wind protection effect, said ludwichowski.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, knee care can only be operated outside the breeding season from October to March.
After tsunami in Sulawesi Indonesia talks about situation on the ground
In an interview with The Editorial Network Germany (RND), the local Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and the tsunami:
Were you there yourself during the tsunami?
No, I was in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned about the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive for more than 20 hours after a flight, as the airport on Palu was closed at the time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that supplies can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, which are all completely destroyed.
Our office of "world Vision" has also been destroyed, but we have provisionally set up something where we have also accommodated other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many have raced on surrounding hills, where they still endure for fear of another tsunami and earthquake, and where they have no access to water and food.
Some are staying in front of their houses, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and gas stations are completely closed, people partly steal food and gasoline.
The civil service is completely shut down, the national government is helping out.
A prison has also been destroyed, some of the prisoners are running around freely and it is difficult to find them.
There are still many bodies lying around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How does the communication and information supply on the island work?
At the moment we have mobile phone reception, but before that it didn't work and we only got information via radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbours and other people who they don't know if they live and where they are because people were not at home during the earthquakes, but at work, for example.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have any information on this?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many thought "okay, not a tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was a misinformation that a tsunami hit the region and they ran into the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi on the Pacific Ring of Fire not prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how to respond to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.
Muscle injuries against Werder: VfB has to give up Aogo and Donis for a long time
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will be missing from VfB Stuttgart with serious muscle injuries for a long time.
Aogo suffered a muscle fibrous tear in the back of his left thigh at the 2-1 against Werder Bremen on Saturday, the Bundesliga football team announced on Sunday.
In Donis, doctors diagnosed a muscle bundle rupture in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss Games after the following break.
VfB Stuttgart did not provide a forecast for downtime.
A muscle bundle rupture usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fiber rupture usually heals a little faster.
Triumph of hyperrealism at the San sebástian Film Festival
San Sebastián - the San Sebastián Film Festival is the annual Closing event of the most prestigious European festivals.
Despite all the comments on the cinema, it can be summed up: 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.
After a convincing competition at Cannes, especially with strong contributions from Europe and Asia and a Venice that attracted a lot of attention with Oscar candidates from Hollywood, San Sebastian also delivered one of its best competitions in recent years.
On Sunday morning, the Olching fire brigade tried to capture an injured duck.
However, the action dragged on for some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - walkers on Lake Olching noticed a white, injured duck on Sunday morning.
She stayed in the area of the water watch station.
To help the animal, passers-by called the police and the fire brigade.
However, the first attempts to capture the duck went wrong.
Despite the injury, she was able to evade the emergency services again and again.
In the end, she fled to the lake.
With a lifeboat, the fire service was able to enter the animal and push it back to shore, where it was then put into a transport box after almost an hour by a firefighter with a bold handle.
The duck injured in the chest was then taken to the Animal Clinic of the LMU in Oberschleissheim.
But according to the initial assessments, their chances of survival are rather slim.
Biathlete Julian Eberhard whips up World Cup medal
Biathlete Julian Eberhard Lange was in fourth place at Olympia.
Next winter, the saalfeldener wants to make up for the missing precious metal at the World Cup in Östersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old The near-reaching medal in the Pyeongchang Olympic sprint.
Seven tenths of a second were missing in bronze at the end.
"I deliberately gave myself time to process this," says Eberhard AT THE OPENING OF THE MyGym gym in his hometown of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top form, but it just didn't want to be.
The Pinzgauer is all the more motivated to make up for the missing precious metal in the new season: "the goal can only be to get back to a major event with the Constitution, to win something.
At some point, you have to strike.
The World Cup track in Östersund (SWE) is Eberhard: "I have already put the track in my heart," he recalls with joy his fourth World Cup place in the individual race last year.
Immediately after the Olympic Games, he celebrated the only individual victory for Austria in the last World Cup winter in the Mass Start competition of Kontiolahti (FIN).
With the season, he ran second in Oslo (NOR).
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation at turbotempo
Time is extremely short and the number of planned interrogations is very limited.
With an FBI investigation at turbotempo, Republicans in the U.S. Senate want to secure the razor-thin majority for justice candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who is controversial over allegations of coercion.
President Donald Trump has given investigators a deadline of Friday to clear up the suspected incidents more than 30 years ago.
The latest twist in the drama about Kavanaugh's appeal, which was accompanied by a culture fight, was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, during which the lawyer threw out angry tirades against the opposition Democrats, the Senate Judiciary Committee should clear the way for the final confirmation of the arch-conservative judge at the U.S. Supreme Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed assured when Senator Jeff Flake suddenly declared, contrary to his initial announcement, that he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who still described Thursday's grievous allegations as "shaming," initially abstained from further attacks against the women and, on the contrary, spoke of "Happiness in misfortune."
In this way, final doubts could be dispelled, he said.
Later, at an election rally, Trump sharply attacked Democrats for rejecting Kavanaugh: "they are trying to block and destroy."
Trump orders FBI investigation into Kavanaugh case
The White House has also extremely limited the powers of investigators.
A government official told the "Wall Street Journal" that they would specifically investigate the well-known accusations of two women, no more than that: "they are not going on a fishing trip."
According to The New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
The mobile radar unit of the municipality of Ried, installed in a "civilian vehicle" to monitor the speed limit, will be stationed on Gartenstrasse from Monday, October 1, according to the municipality.
The Federal School Centre is also located there.
The municipality also operates several fixed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: you felt the fear
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first win of the season against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first win of the season.
Nevertheless, the time factor also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - it is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches.
That was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
'i've seen every ball in it.
And there were lots of corners and lots of balls in our penalty area, "Schalke 04" s Sports Board said - and breathed.
After all, the Königsblau managed to get the narrow 1-0 against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first victory of the season under control.
In fact, things could have been different.
After the lead by Alessandro Schöpf 11th gave the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco security: "overall, the first half was good, both playful and pressing," the head obviously played more and more a role as the game lasted.
Don't actually create a header monster
"the last ten minutes felt like two hours for me," said Heidel: "if the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore withdrew further and further.
And defended against Mainz with a man and a mouse.
To save the first three points of the season.
"we all liked a huge stone from the heart," said Schöpf, who had no insignificant part in it with his header hit: "I'm actually the worst header player in the team."
But in the end, only victory counts.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, including Tedesco, of course.
"we wanted to start with pressure in the initial phase and make a firework out of it," said Schalke's head coach.
Victory was important.
Finally, we can look forward to a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We played intelligently, calmly and courageously, so we have to tackle games over 90 minutes
Probably the biggest shortcoming of the afternoon: Königsblau missed making things clearer.
The possibilities were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen konpplyanka, who hit the crossbar twice 59th / 72nd or Amine Harit 62.
"then it wouldn't have been a tremor victory," Tedesco said: "you've already felt the fear a bit."
So I'm glad we won.
He was not the only Schalker.
Fischbachau: smoke column in the Leitzachtal Valley 2 km visible
The smoke was not to be overlooked.
From around two kilometres away, a hiker observed a fire in the Leitzachtal on Sunday at around 1.30pm.
Now the police are investigating.
Fischbachau - the police and fire brigade soon found out the cause: an unknown person had set fire to rubbish on a two-square-metre area at Gschwendner Berg.
According to the police, it appeared that he had monitored the fire for a long time, but then left the embers unattended.
And that near the forest.
30 Fischbachau firefighters were busy pulling apart and deleting.
Police are now investigating arson.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-mafaalani discusses Integration: a discussion at eye level
In front of them is the author, Professor Aladin El-mafaalani.
He has once again accepted the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have made it my task to bring interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "reckenfelder Treff" - the association that cooperates with the "Kulturpolitik" alliance in organising the evening.
El-mafaalani enters the reading very loosely, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject in a comprehensible way.
With a lot of gestures, solid numbers and one or two jokes, he brings listeners closer to one of the most conflicted Topics: migration and integration.
Why do conflicts arise despite successful integration?
The Syrian-born author uses a metaphor to answer the question.
German society is sitting at one table, first-generation migrants are sitting at the katzentisch.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to go to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to play their part.
This leads to conflicts.
It is therefore crucial not to classify oneself politically on the right or on the left, but rather: "am I for or against an open society?" he points out.
In the beginning, the discussion is more cautious, then more and more lively.
And there is a need for speech.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among pupils.
El-mafaalani stands before, not on stage, a symbol of the discussion: she is on par.
The sociology professor does not impose his opinion, emphasizing that he speaks of the average, not of individual destinies.
He is pleased that there is interest in the issue, because "it is only when we understand what the problem is that we can find solutions," says El-mafaalani.
Even during the subsequent signing ceremony, he was still listening to the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, where prepared Kurdish specialities were discussed intensively.
Basketball: Bonn and Gießen win kick-off games
The GIESSEN 46ers and the Telekom Baskets Bonn have finished the first day of the Basketball Bundesliga (BBL) with a home and an away victory.
Gießen prevailed in a hard-fought match in his own hall with 91: 84 (43: 46) against the Central German BC.
The ambitious Bonn team won at the BG Göttingen with 86: 79 (49: 47).
Alba Berlin is the first championship leader of the season after the 112: 55 Gala on Saturday against science city Jena.
At the beginning of the new season, the German champion Bayern Munich and the former series champion Brose Bamberg had much more trouble.
Munich already struggled to score an 83: 77 at Ratiopharm Ulm on Friday, Bamberg won the Frankenderby at s.Oliver Würzburg with 84: 80 on Saturday.
Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The demand is apparently huge: more than 100 interested parties have applied for the purchase of one of the plots in Landsham-South.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first plots of land in the new Landsham-south development area on the open market.
Mayor Roland Frick says so.
In addition, the application phase for the 20 plots of land that the municipality offers at more favourable conditions or prices is completed - similar to the previous local model.
A good 100 applications have been received, says Frick.
"the documents are currently being examined," with regard to the application criteria, completeness and accuracy.
According to the mayor of Plieningen, the goal is to have compiled the list of candidates for the 20 plots by the end of the year and to present them to the local council.
After that, the award could take place.
A total of 50 plots of land for single and double houses will be created on the area in the south of Landsham, as well as four areas for multi-family houses with an expected eight units each.
The development is now almost complete and the roads and roads will soon be paved.
A single property and two of the multi-family houses belong to a private person, the rest of the municipality of Pliening.
It sells most of the land on the open market, 20 plots in a socially acceptable model.
According to Frick, the two multi-family houses in the municipality are to be built as affordable housing.
With a total of 16 income-oriented apartments supported by the Free State.
Space for 200 people
Roughly estimated, housing for about 200 people is being created on the area of the new Landsham-South Development Area.
Not only that: now, at the beginning of October, according to Frick, the start of the new construction of a daycare facility is taking place there.
It will house three kindergarten groups and three crèche groups, as well as a multi-purpose room.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, at the start of the next kindergarten year.
This is how Schalke's Naldo succeeds in "great sport" on the bench
Not in the starting line for the third time in a row: nevertheless, Naldo thanks Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - after Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues sat for the third time in a row not in the Schalker Startelf, but on the exchange bench, the understanding would have been great for many people, if the almost two-meter-tall Brazilian had really spoken the frustration of the soul.
But when the Schalke players gathered in the middle circle as usual after the 1-0 win over FSV Mainz 05 and thanked head coach Domenico Tedesco for all his professionals, the 36-year-old, who is all called Naldo for the sake of simplicity, turned in and said: "we have to thank, Coach!"
"it was very emotional, it was a great sport," Tedesco said later about the reaction of his vice-captain, who, despite being a reservist again, had no resentment.
Problích knows Naldo, who was hailed as the best Schalker last season, that he didn't actually get on the pitch with his coach - but was given a break for good reasons.
A reason called "load control."
It was not easy to tell him
"it wasn't easy to tell him that, I'll tell you quite honestly," Tedesco reported from the moment he told Naldo he wasn't in the starting line.
He is an important player, he is an important person.
But it's always about the matter, it's about the club, "Tedesco justified the move.
Naldo has played 90 minutes against Bayern and Porto.
He is 36 years old.
It is important that everyone can take a breather at the moment.
And that we all keep in the boat, "Tedesco explained the rotation, which Naldo also recently caught.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by also proving to be an exemplary team player on the bench.
The mood in Austria's industry accelerated its decline in August compared to the eurozone.
The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was at a 37-month low of 46.7 points.
Europe-wide, Austria still has the third-best sentiment behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute announced on Monday in its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the euro zone PMI rose 1.1 points to 45.1 points, but the index is still below the 50-meter mark for the 13th month in a row, indicating growth.
Only Ireland's industry cracked that threshold with 50.9 points in August.
The Greeks were at the bottom (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer declined, but more slowly than in the months before.
In Spain, the index peaked at 44.0 points since March.
"the slightly weakened descent may mean that the worst is over," said Markit Economist Rob Dobson.
But the industry - in the third quarter anyway - remains the number one growth brake.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the eurozone fell as much as they had not since November 2011.
The companies therefore cut jobs for the seventh month in a row.
In China, too, industrial production fell more sharply in August than initially thought.
The mood barometer fell from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts initially expected 47.8 points.
The Purchasing Managers' Index bases its figures on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Among other things, developments in turnover, employment, storage and prices will be collected.
Tuchel's PSG team wins eighth league game
September 29, 2018 at 07: 45 PM
Nice coach Thomas Tuchel rushes on from victory to victory with Paris Saint-Germain in France's football championship.
At OGC Nice, the defending champion won 3-0 (1-0) thanks to two hits from superstar Neymar and was thus also successful in the eighth league match.
Most recently, Olympique Lyon had made such a good start to the season in France 82 years ago.
Brazilian Neymar put PSG in the lead after 22 minutes and set the finishing line in the post-match period.
Christopher Nkunku (46.) provided the Midterm 2-0.
With this, Paris also managed the dress rehearsal for the groundbreaking second Champions League group match against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
At the start of the premier class, Tuchel's team had to accept the only mandatory match defeat so far this season at the 2-3 in Liverpool.
