DFB Chief Grindel sees no basis for Özil comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for a return of Mesut Özil to the national team.
"This is a question that obviously depends on getting into conversation, on talking to him about why he seemed to have felt something like that in his statement," said Grindel in the football team. Podcast "Phrasenmäher" of the "Bild-Zeitung."
Despite the months ’ debate on Özil ’ s photos with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regretted the resignation of 92-time national player Özil.
"I would have liked Mesut Özil to continue playing for Germany.
I also thought, at some point, that this would be the case, "said Grindel.
The 29-year-old de announced his resignation from the DFB team in July, also because Grindel did not defend him against racist attacks during the World Cup.
The DFB leader reiterated his criticism of Özil that he was not prepared for a conversation with Federal Coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to build pressure, but he knows from football that when "you leave a team or change a club, you talk to your coach, and I find it a pity that this conversation has not yet come to fruition." ."
Linz: Gartenhütte in Schrebergartensiedlung burned
At 14.13 a.m., the fire brigade Linz was alerted to a fire on the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly across the Schrebergarten settlement, danger was in delay.
The professional fire brigade disappeared and found the hut in Vollbrand when it arrived.
The roof had to be removed practically completely and fire protection was removed to the necessary extent.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had injected a battery for the shop at noon.
This could possibly be the cause of fire.
In any case, according to firefighters, the charger was in the highest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire still needs to be determined, as does the cause of the fire.
However, it is likely to be considerable, because the owner had many collectors in his garden hut.
An angry mother defends herself: Lindsay Lohan attacks the refugee family on the open road
What has led Lindsay Lohan to this very strange action?
She apparently wanted to throw the children away from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: fully loaded") broadcasted herself live as she apparently wants to throw the children away from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the us "TMZ" portal and publishes a partial mean of the stream.
Here you can see "Kissed to Happiness" with Lindsay Lohan
The clip shows Lohan getting out of a car and going to a possibly homeless family that she wants to make out as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family escapes the actress, Lohan persecutes her parents and children.
It accuses adults of trafficking in children.
For all this, it does not provide evidence in the clip.
"The whole world is seeing this," Lohan says in the video of how she continues to follow the family along the road.
It seems to be trying to separate the children from their parents.
At some point, however, it seems to be enough for the apparently angry mother.
It looks as if she is turning around and Lohan is missing an ear.
In tears, the actress says how shocked she is - and she keeps her cheek.
What Lohan has contributed to this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing in Ryugu: this task is "mascot" on the asteroid
The "Hayabusa2" probe was launched in Japan in December 2014.
It should approach the asteroid Ryugu so closely that it can absorb material from its surface and bring it to the earth.
The lander "Mascot" will remain in Ryugu.
Foreign tickers: the number of deaths on Sulawesi increases to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of 7.5 and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, there are at least 420 deaths.
The number of victims could increase further.
The rescue teams have not yet entered the devastated areas cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla Supervisory Board
There was a tweet in the beginning.
Tesla ’ s CEO, Elon Musk, caused unrest in stock markets at the beginning of August when he announced a withdrawal of the electric car manufacturer.
The us Stock Exchange Supervisor sued him for fraud, but now they have both agreed.

British Conservative Party Conference
Sharply guarded - the Tories' Party Conference
Birmingham is becoming the stage of a power struggle.
The party conference is about foreign policy, trade issues, and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit Hardliners, former foreign minister Boris Johnson at the forefront.
Referendum for a new state name
Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing over these names for years.
Now they have agreed.
The state of Macedonia should be called Northern Macedonia in the future, and this Sunday the population is voting on it - whether it is going well?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("Der nicht") means Jair Bolsonaro.
One week before the Brazilian presidential election, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands went to the streets in several cities to protest the right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" stands as an anti-system candidate and is thus the leading figure in the surveys.
His strongest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Labour Party.
Audi: "Diesel gate" processing takes longer than planned
"There is still a diesel task force," said Peter Mertens, CEO of the Automotive Week industry.
In December 2017, the detention and leave of Audi CEO Rupert Stadler announced that the Task Force would soon be dissolved.
"All engine / gearbox combinations are expected to be checked in the first quarter of 2018," he said.
Mertens now said: "In early July, we achieved an important milestone in the resolution of the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analysis of our VTDI engines.
The Task Force was established in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at the Volkswagen Audi mother.
Mertens stressed that the car manufacturer had made "major organisational changes" so that such a scandal would never happen again.
The VW Supervisory Board postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and intends to discuss it further this Tuesday.
The investigation authorities accuse the head of Audi of having approved the sale of diesel cars with incorrect exhaust emission levels after notification of the exhaust gas fraud operations.
He knew or deliberately ignored the manipulations.
Mr Bram Schot, Chief Executive Officer of Sales, is currently chairing the company as Chief Executive Officer.
Because of the switch to the new WLTP exhaust and consumption testing standard, there were production failures at Audi, said Schot the "Heilbronner vote."
In principle, he saw a decline in demand for limousines, such as the A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Schot focuses on electric mobility.
15,000 reservations have already been made for the e-tron, the first Audi electric car.
Grindel seeks re-election - Lahm to be appointed to the DFB Bureau
Mainz (DPA) - Despite criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair next year, Reinhard Grindel intends to re-establish his position as DFB President.
"I am doing my job and I am trying to do it as well as I can," Grindel said as a guest at the ZDF's "Current Sports Studio" early on Sunday morning.
It is necessary to try again and again for a re-election, and I will do so.
And then you have to see whether the support is there.
In his own words, the head of the association would find it "strange" if he did not "want to cooperate in the future project" after the award for the Fußball-EM 2024.
Since April 2016, Grindel has been the head of the association to succeed Wolfgang Niersbach, who fell over the summer fairy tale affair.
In autumn 2016, he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will be on the DFB's federal day on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future EC chief executive, Philipp Lahm, will cooperate in the DFB Bureau.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that he would continue to advise on this role in the Bureau and would then, of course, be cordially invited to provide his experience in sporting matters," Grindel.
He did not want to participate in speculation about whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB leader.
As a consequence of the affair of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that a national player without a migration background should become the DFB's integration messenger in the future.. "
The native Brazilians Cacau and Celia Sasic are currently in office, the latter being family-owned in Cameroon.
"If a person without a migrant background clearly contributes to society and football and says that" the issue is important, we must take care ," this would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground, where integration must work," said Grindel.
Decrease correctly with half-wise scale
I have had a new toy for four weeks.
A scale that measures not only my weight, but also the body fat content.
It may also indicate muscle and bone mass.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but it is more likely to be desirable.
He does not say anything about whether I have replaced fat with muscles.
Basketball Bundesliga: clear successes for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - Alba Berlin has started with a significant victory in the new season of the Federal Basketball League.
Against Science City Jena, the Vice Champion won easily at 112: 55 (52: 31) and offered a convincing game over 40 minutes.
With 20 points, Rokas Giedraitis ’ s new entrance was the top scorer of the dominant Berlin.
The national player Johannes Thiemann (18 counters), required from Ludwigsburg, also showed attractive performance in his compulsory debut before 9113 spectators.
Ex-master Brose Bamberg won 84: 80 (39: 37) at the compulsory debut of trainer Ainars Bagatskis at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the best shipowner with 24 points.
Würzburg-Profi Gabriel Olaseni came to 14 counters.
Last year ’ s playoff semi finalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg imposed the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt at 83: 76 (41: 34).
New national player Karim Jallow was the most striking shooter with 24 points in the team of coach John Patrick.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a significant success.
The basketball lions in Braunschweig had a clear 100: 64 (48: 30) and the first two points.
The new playmaker Will Cummings outperformed the Oldenburgs with 25 counters.
The Braunschweigers, with NBA star Dennis Schröder as majority owner since the beginning of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26-1 run of the baskets quickly created clear conditions.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to extradite supporters of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to act against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens - no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or the Gulf Movement to shake our citizens and harm German-Turkish friendship, "he said.
For the opening of the Ditib Mosque, the city centre of Cologne had been partially blocked.
Several thousand police officers were involved, including snipers.
The Islam association Ditib is criticized because it is considered an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": music Against Poverty: stars, Buhrufe und Schrecksecond
Musicians like Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes, and Cardi B promoted more commitment to the fight against poverty and disease at a joint concert in New York Central Park.
"Engage yourself wherever you can," Mendes said at the festival on Sunday night around 60.0000 viewers.
Thank you for coming here, this is a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with fringes and a golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations, and relief organisations, also appeared on stage in the multi-hour spectacle.
In the meantime, however, there was a terrible second when many spectators thought the noise of a falling metal barrier was shot, feared, and tried to flee.
Panic arose briefly, people were confused.
Seven viewers were slightly injured, organiser Hugh Evans said.
But the New York police and the musician Chris Martin calmed people off the stage.
"No one is trying to hurt anyone," said Martin.
You are all in safety.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge on the Internet as every year.
Those who wanted to catch up had to read and distribute texts, photos, and videos on the global fight against poverty and disease on the Internet.
For the numerous musicians and actors, the audience was cheering and applauding – bowls for Republican Senator Jeff Flake, on the other hand.
He, together with his democratic colleague Chris Coons, argued for more equality between men and women on the stage.
On Friday, however, Flake voted for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge at the Supreme Court in the us Senate ’ s Justice Committee, thus raising many women ’ s heads.
At least three women have filed allegations of abuse up to the attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which it rejects.
Flake called for an FBI investigation of the allegations after two women who, according to their own data, experienced sexual attacks themselves faced him on the way to the committee meeting in an elevator.
"You will be happy to meet me in an elevator at any time," Flake said to the audience at the New York concert.
Freedom of the press: Federal Government defends journalist's ejection
Prime Minister Steffen Seibert has defended the ejection of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
At the Chancellery, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had moved a T-shirt with the Turkish and German words "Freedom for Journalists" and had entered the first row.
The t-shirt was not the problem, said Seibert der Bild on Sunday.
It was a disruption of the press conference.
The journalist's action had created a strong unrest, which was unacceptable.
It was for this reason that protectors would bring the man out.
Seibert said that it was not permitted to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This applies completely irrespective of whether or not it is a legitimate concern.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, many journalists are in prison.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage or support or membership in forbidden parties or the Fethullah Gulf movement.
The Turkish leadership is responsible for the failed coup attempt on 15 July 2016.
Some of the accused journalists threaten to be imprisoned for several decades.
Foreign journalists are also uncertain from the Turkish authorities: Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested only in early September.
Recently, the cases of imprisoned journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel caused alarm.
While they were free and were able to return to Germany, there are still trials in Turkey against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him so fresh and good-looking: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look at this twice: Yes, this is really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht," produced by the NDR, is well-known for happy conversations at the bar of the Hamburg port pub "Schellfischposten."
Moderator Ina Müller and her guests encounter some beers, some wines or even more high-percent drinks in order to relax the mood and tongues.
Not a few celebrities drink courage for compulsory singing deposits as well.
Another consequence of the popular talk show was recorded on Friday.
This time: the actor Florian David Fitz is known from movies like "Männerherzen," "Terror - Your Judgment" or "Der geilste Tag."
But the Munich trip to the high north was not good.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely crushed, his eyes just two little slots.
The bed-selfie shows a completely disappeared Florian David Fitz.
But he is not sick, he has only one powerful cat.
He addressed his fans with some of the insights he has now gained, probably not quite seriously: "One rule: never go to Ina's night.
Rule two: never drink the black sow.
And spray.
And leave the round of egg liqueur, which Ina shoots by half three.
Alcohol consumption is truly in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans immediately posted a few tips to fight offences.
They ranged from instant broth, fish roasting, or, presumably, the most effective, headache tablets.
Others simply enjoyed the view of the usually attractive cinema bar.
It is not yet known how Ina Müller survived the nightly junk.
But since it has been moderating TV fun at the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more proven...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa is struggling with vandalism and cunning
The entry into the 36 kilometre long railway bike path in Treysa is difficult to find and garnish.
Recipes against ruinous vandalism are sought, but solutions are hardly distinguished.
Shears, cigarette tips, garbage and rubbish, demolished waste bin and meanwhile dismantled warning signs have been presenting the entry with a seat group to the cycling route on the Haaße hill in Treysa for a long time.
A more than unknown sight for the model railway bike path in the Red-Kappchenland.
The issue has been addressed by members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also by others for a long time, said the cycling representative of the city of Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem had already been addressed in the cycling advisory board.
There is no solution so far.
The proposals ranged from the transfer of the seat to the regular emptying of the waste containers and the cleaning of the land at the point of entry.
"I think the latter would be the requirement of the hour, irrespective of possible further activities," says Deserthagen.
Mr Hahn (ADFC) reported that the subject had also been addressed to the local advisory board.
It is not only the rubbish that drives cyclists and residents - the seat is a regular meeting place on weekends.
Not only does it often happen loudly, but it also destroys beams: posts are torn from the ground, garbage buckets are demolished, signs are reversed, seating furniture is locked.
Volunteers have already cleared up more frequently, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
The actions, however, were only the proverbial drop on the hot stone.
They are annoyed by the fact that the resting place on the bicycle path in Treysa is a meeting place for junkies.
"There is clearly a focus along the entire cycling route on the Haaße hill," confirms the cycling representative, who is now also concerned about the new cycling site in Ziegenhain, which will be opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be really expensive."
Another idea was a video surveillance on the hill: "This may be a significantly higher threshold for attacking commodities.
This would, however, presuppose that police maturity is over soon.
Deserthagen basically wants the Haaße hill to develop.
It needed to be made more attractive.
The frequency of the bicycle path so far could be very satisfactory.
The tourism market is still expanding.
Our cycling path is very high-quality compared to others in Germany ," said ADFC members.
As an extremely critical danger point, ADFC member Susanne Klippert appreciates the situation on Ascheröder Straße in Treysa.
There is no bending trail on the Haaße hill.
In the case of high-speed traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between the two sides of the traffic ," she explains.
This was not a problem for sport drivers, but probably for the elderly and especially for children.
Music Contest at the Kulturbahnhof: the "Kö von Hiltrup" and the Sea
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and mutual.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the Hiltrup district offensive, in the "music contest for large and small, young and experienced musicians."
A contest "with eyelashes in the sympathetic Hiltruper family," as Karl Franke put it.
Indeed, it was soon a family cooperation in coffee and cakes from the volunteers of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven formations started, from the one-man band to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long living Albachtener in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltruper Sternfarben," three members and three generations the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the Lummerland kindergarten and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
This contest, the district mayor Joachim Schmidt said, was a novelty.
We have not yet seen this in other parts of the city.
What was the link between the writers?
The Hiltruper See and the market alley were particularly frequently mentioned in the localities.
Rolf Ihmig culminated the avenue in his striking song "Kö von Hiltrup."
The Kulturbahnhof was also honoured.
It was time and again about experiencing together in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short breaks with short interviews with the performers or references to their work.
He learned from Humberg that he actually studied chemistry, but now also taught guitar.
By sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann, Franke knew that he recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
Meanwhile, Alvin Jasic has placed himself on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
Indeed, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper Gastronomie.
However, there was something special for the jury's favourites - so that others could hear their songs.
A whole CD can be played by Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with recording technician Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup defeat, who impressed Franke particularly with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very beautiful performance" with ten children and two guitar teachers; and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone, the children once again appeared in the finals - and even sounded "really good" without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, recognition of the melody and recognition.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Economic Association, and Jan Kaven, Chairman of the Urban Offensive.
The urban offensive launched the event on the occasion of its ten-year existence.
She saw the event as a full success.
Everyone was "very satisfied" and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
Players are made up of two teams facing each other.
For each side there is a screen with four cards with keywords, which can only be calculated - the old trick with the red foil - when inserted.
This ensures that the opposite party cannot read by mistake.
For example, the maps read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2. windows.
3. cubes.
4th Feast ."
These are the terms that need to be encrypted from now on.
It is not the terms but the codes that are to be considered here.
Alternately, one player per team is the encryptor.
He gets a code card with perhaps "3.4.2."
"Decrypto" does not refer to the terms behind the secret film, but to its encryption codes.
Its task in this case is to describe the terms "cubes," "fixed" and "windows" in this order and in this example, in such a way that its own team recognises the correct order and the opposing team may not, because that will win the game if it manages to crack the code twice.
The encryptor thus lists and reads loudly: "Throw" for the cubes, "loose" as opposed to fixed; here, of course, something like "party" and "prague" would be possible because he attended school. has and knows the window crash.
This is the way round by round, team by team.
Although one does not know the concepts of the opposite, they can better combine them with any indication the encryptor gives there.
The descriptions should be as mysterious as possible, but not to be turned off, otherwise they make it unnecessarily difficult for their team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptic of "decrypto" is the rulebook.
Players will probably have to study it long and extensively before they can finally play.
The explanatory video on decrypto.info on the net makes it easier.
But those who have just started will be fascinated by how much feeling there is in this inconspicuous game.
Overall, however, "decrypto" is not as coherent as predecessor and genre-prime "codenames," which also puts an agent's theme on a match of less words, but much better to play in small groups.
And anyone who is only concerned with rates and not victories can easily find a version for two.
Kulmbach: man shows Hitler's greetings to the police and harasses guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man employed Kulmbach's police inspection twice during the night from Saturday to Sunday.
He only showed the greeting of Hitler in the upper city of a passing police maturity, and later he also fell in the upper city in a pub when he harassed other guests.
After he clearly alcoholized the police ’ s allocated space, he had to spend the night at Kulmbach ’ s police inspections in the prison cell.
In a sober state, he must also be responsible for criminal law because of the use of labels of unconstitutional organisations.
The Pressig plant was home to the drawers
The railway station in Pressig has been the turntable in the Frankenwald for decades.
A piece of railway history ended in 1991.
"When buffers hit buffers, they heard it all in the press," remembers Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the railway station.
This did not encourage anyone.
The brakes squealed and the wagons crashed.
That was pure railroad.
Statements symbolic of Dinkel's homeland, Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so marked by the railways.
This was the starting point of the Steilrampen mountain range to the north, which, after an increase of about 220 metres in altitude, has its headquarters in Steinbach am Wald.
To manage this, train and drawer locks were used to be needed, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway workshop with 21 locomotives, apprenticeships, conveyance and railway championships.
"The centrepiece was the turntable, which had a diameter of 18 metres after a reconstruction in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, a railway historian and 47 years of professional railway workers.
The railway works (BW) Pressig, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, also operated locomotives for the secondary lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On 15 July 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight Elloks were stationed in press at the time.
The electrification of the 1939 route already minimised the need for train and drawbars.
Since 1977, they have only been used for freight trains.
Until 1991, at least 10 000 weights were ranked each month.
Parts of the plant were cancelled in 1982, the rest in 1991.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that no better use of the site has been envisaged, including in the area of freight transport."
On Pentecost 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated a pompous railway station celebration in Pressig on the occasion of the anniversary of "50 years of electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld."
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," remembers Georg Dinkel.
A little later.
On 1 June 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn and Pressig's shunting station was history.
"The most difficult work has been carried out by shunters and barriers on the train," Dinkel recalls.
Any failure would have had fatal consequences.
Why the Pressig-Rothenkirchen station has led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many more historical and current pictures can be found here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber succeeding at China Open
Beijing (DPA) – Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round of the Beijing tennis tournament, as Julia Görges had done before.
Kerber won the China Open 6: 2, 6: 2 against French woman Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the world rankings third is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or Spaniard Carla Suárez Navarro.
The winner was 6: 3, 4: 2 against Darja Kassatkina when the Russian number 13 abandoned.
The Swabian is now dealing with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
A special exhibition was opened at the weekend in Mittelehrenbach as part of the series "Art and pleasure."
Organisers and visitors registered with great relief looked at the ideal weather when the Special Vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the open-air area of the Dahlmann- Schmidt estate in Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the umbrella of the tourism association "Rund ums Walberla" in the framework of the series "Art and pleasure."
It opened its doors in the 15th year.
The exhibition's fascination was reflected in a strong visitor's appeal.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be visited in Mittelehrenbach.
Mr Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the Vernissage.
He himself has been involved since the first hour.
Just like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist alike.
Somewhat surprisingly, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he placed his task in proven, young hands with good prospects for the future.
Both have already been actively involved in the selection of artists and have contributed to the creation of flyers in the past.
On the occasion of Kunst & Genuss, they will again have a special 70 cent letter stamp designed by Kunst & Genuss, available at each art station.
This year's poster "Betzn austanzen," designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased with the high standard of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg was won for the musical surroundings.
When passing through the generous garden, the visitor quickly realizes that the title "wind game performance" formally challenges artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it in a playful way.
They are works of metal or ceramic art, often with colour accents.
Already at the entrance of the property, visitors await the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau, on the right hand side of the "lucky tree."
It is a tree stump, colour brightened, playfully equipped with 20 wind wheels, 24 horseshoe irons and 24 aluminium tubes as a soundpiece.
With the sun flashing through the bushwork in the background, the object looks fabulously merry and invites you to stay.
From Eckental comes Barbara Waschneck, who prefers to dedicate herself to the event for 15 years in three-dimensional letters.
There are many parts, moving in the wind.
Halfway from Eckental, Siegrid Frey has exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child."
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colourful imagination of clay, cement, and stainless steel.
The theme of "wind game performance" for walking through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition may be visited by 31 December 2018.
50 Years of ABM 68 Albachten: singers celebrate 50th anniversary
1968 - that was the time of protest and the student movement.
And the Albachten people, too, caught their disgust at that time.
At least five of them.
They did not want to come to terms with the fact that, after the dissolution of the Cäcilia church, there should no longer be a sanctimonious life in the neighbourhood.
It has become a legend: at a bank in Tinnenbusch, they raised 68 Albachten from baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
The anniversary has now been celebrated in the "House of Meeting."
"It will be full today," said Chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he should be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albachten singers.
On the occasion of their anniversary, they had revived the festival.
It was a tradition for years, and then there was a break.
On time for the 50th anniversary, the festival of tradition was back.
An elegant ball became it, for festive clothes had been asked before.
The guests were not sitting in the "House of Meeting" as usual, but comfortably at tables.
In the meantime, movement was told: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln attracted the controllers and asked for the dance floor.
The singers of the 68 Albachten themselves had the voice sounded.

Volleyball: 3rd League Women: USC II wins high-class derby against BW Aasee
The ascender marches.
Three games, three victories – the reserve of the USC Münster under the patronage of Axel Büring is quite right in league three.
No trace of shyness or freaks, the independent do their thing.
And that is good for 3: 0 (25: 15, 25: 23, 26: 24) against urban competitor BW Aasee.
"That was not crystal clear, but we have already left an impression," says the reasonably satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
We are not dissatisfied. "On the contrary.
In the evening, at a later birthday party of Ronja de Boer, the atmosphere was good, the game closed.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical deception.
In the third sentence, the guests had a ball.
"If they aim to achieve the goal, such a game can already tilt," Büring knows from years of experience.
After all, the USC, with its routine forces, made everything clear and achieved full yield.
"We all know who stands in such a derby on the other side.
That doesn't break our neck.
I've seen phase by phase really good volleyball ," Annacker didn't argue with 0: 3 and went to the agenda immediately.
Wherever the journey goes for the independent seems unpredictable after just three days.
"It is simply too early for this," says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The 3rd league has an incredibly good level.
This is not nearly comparable with regional league volleyball. "They don't want to look down into the fourth league anyway.
If the vest is not polluted in the next few weeks, it must look upwards.
However, an initial assessment can only be made after ten or eleven games.
On Saturday we will visit Emlichheim for the first time.
Aasee will arrive in Essen on 14 October.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "dream ship" Heide Keller became a star.
She now speaks frankly about the fact that the series could have had complicity in her marriage with Hans von Borsody.
Her role as Chief Hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "dream ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018 she went on board forever.
The series that made her a star could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929-2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
"This could also have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled around the world alone with a suitcase, and many of my admired colleagues perceived me at eye level, "says Keller in conversation with the" picture on Sunday ."
First of all, she had always been "Hans von Borsody's wife," but this had changed with the "dream ship."
For now the journalists have only called Heide Keller.
"I don't know whether he liked it so much."
She considered it possible that her husband might have been envious, but "like many men, Hans spooked discussions about problems and feelings."
Keller had always tried to be the only one for Hans von Borsody "and he did not want to get to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I've gone misplaced ," as she explains.
She had always felt "not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman, whom I never really was, even though I sometimes appeared bold and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever ."
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller once again said yes, "although I was afraid it might go wrong a second time."
The day before the civil wedding, I was howling in the wardrobe and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to Borsody also failed.
Why has it never worked with men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller had loved himself at the time "as shown in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday life.
I have taken a far too naive approach to love ."
The night falter, who regularly explores the night life of the city in the NZZ resort of Zurich, has this time ventured to the ZFF Opening Party.
Our fold is not a moth, but a little light-hearted.
And the bright shine in which a green carpet has been immersed in the six-seater ’ s square is excessively dazzling.
But it ’ s a film festival, because more or less famous people want to sunbathe in the headlight.
This late Thursday evening, he will talk about the square in order to make it easier for himself in the "Aquaclean WC oasis."
This is what the public toilet facility, sponsored by a large sanitary company, celebrates its premiere at the festival: the toilet in the ground of a new pavilion makes a lot of effort to create a luxurious atmosphere.
This evening, however, it smells in the oasis of men for some reason.
So get out here, on the other side of the street: invited guests who have just entertained at the best level in the cinema next to the opening movie "Green Book" celebrate, as every year, the start of the festival with a party in the three-storey department store.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: the works shown are from all over the globe.
What doesn't need to be done in an article about this festival in order to avoid being advertised for its 190 partner companies?
The folder ties a bundle around the sensors, which has given him a good fairy, and two bully doorkeepers actually waving him in general.
Inside, the invited people push, dance to live music well after midnight, or have DJ rhythms to which they shout together, and flush with Cüpli exquisite snacks.
In the delicatessen shop in the basement, oysters are waiting for wrinkling mouths; next door, the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut, a chocolate fountain is spruced.
And the hammer is that all the sales racks of exclusive products have not been cleaned up for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without major losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The folder studies the sign at the escalator: "Wear a long dress, please be careful on the escalator."
If these are two separate instructions, he has lost himself in the dress code.
But it is rather a conditional construction, and it has certainly already saved lives.
In the household goods department on the upper floor, the poultry tips a cocktail prepared with espresso, called "Golden Eye," for the Festival Award.
This mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself, does not receive the prize for the best drink.
And George Clooney, who has been advocating for this brand for years, is not here that evening either.
But there, between local celebrities, cashier tables and kitchen items, passes a face known to the observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His leading actor should not be far away.
And, indeed, Viggo Mortensen, with nearly sixty almost like a choir boy, is walking through the crowd.
He is not squashed, he is not squashed, he is not squashed at all.
It is precisely for this restraint, preferably misunderstood as a clamour, that international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumbia dances
Coach and former football star Diego Maradona is pleased with his team ’ s victory.
Argentina ’ s football legend Diego Maradona seems to have lived well in his new homeland of Mexico.
After a 2-0 victory in his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced to Cumbia-Rythmen with a player in the cabin, as shown in a video already published on Saturday.
In a team member ’ s 15-minute clip, Maradona dances in a yellow jersey, fired by players.

Handball: Association League 1: ASV sending after last minute plate "destroyed on the ground"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball association lister ASV, could hardly comprehend "such a bitter defeat." his protectors were "destroyed" after the unfortunate 29: 30 (12: 14) - failure - of the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday evening at lit Germania 2.
They had not played badly - as in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst - over long periods, the broadcasters.
Only the initial phase "we have fallen asleep," the ASV trainer was angry.
The housekeepers quickly led with 8: 1, and the early break that Bieletzki had taken did not work at first.
"But then suddenly there was a jump through the team," summarized Bieletzki for the second quarter of an hour.
For the break, the gate was only two more goals.
In particular, Sendens Bester, Marius Hintze, met once and for all in the phase.
After the change, it became even better from a visitor's point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst reached 3: 15 p.m., followed by an almost consistent season changer.
Four minutes before the siren, the advance was still apparently reassuring three hits (29: 26).
And then?
The impartial intervened.
Bieletzki usually does not guard against looking for guilt against others.
But the 120-second penalty that Steffen Mühlhoff collected was "a joke."
Lit laughed well and met four more times until the end, while the decimated ASV failed in the last attack.
The guys fought greatly, stood well against seven men behind them, and threw them again and again at the empty gate.
Only they can buy little for the compliments.
"There must now be a damned victory," said the restless Bieletzki.
ASV goals: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hanging (1).
Bavaria: missing woman for 30 years - police digging for corpses
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an 18-year-old from Naila (Hof County), the police are looking for the women's mortal remains.
On Saturday, operatives dug up a road near Marxgrün.

The woman has disappeared since 4 November 1986.
The investigators did not rule out a crime at the time.
Since last year, the Criminal Police Court, together with the Prosecutor's Office, has been working intensively on the case again.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Monument Protection Authority, investigators found a spotlight under the street near Marxgrün by means of a ground radar.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, officials adjacent the post to a few meters.
The results of excavations should be announced in the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows what dangers are on the net.
However, users themselves can also provide additional security.
Instead of complicated letter sequences, users should rather use passphrases to secure their accounts on the network.
In addition, security updates, for example for Windows, should be installed quickly and do not harm equipping computers with antivirus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his threat of withdrawal as head of the billionaire company.
He and the us Securities and Exchange Commission sec filed an out-of-court dispute over misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla are paying $20 million each, and Musk is giving up the Chairman ’ s office for three years, a position similar to that of the German Supervisory Board.
He may remain Chairman of the Management Board.
In the comparison, which has yet to be confirmed by a court, neither muscle nor Tesla admitted misconduct.
The sec had sued the world-famous manager before the us Federal Court of Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, also headed by SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-writing electric car pioneer, now valued at more than $50 billion on the stock exchange.
Muscle is not aware of guilt
Musk explained that he had done nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed with the lawsuit.
He has always acted in the sense of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk had written to his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he would perhaps take the company off the stock exchange, paying $420 per share that the funding was secured.
This would have given Tesla a total of $72 billion.
Later, muscle rowed back: Tesla remained on the stock exchange.
Following the agreement, Tesla will now have to find an outside chairman, recruit two independent members of the board and also set up a committee to monitor musks communication.

Surveys: 46% do not want Merkel as Chancellor by 2021
According to the crossroads of recent weeks, the GroKo collects several survey deep blows.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in a survey – Angela Merkel is seen critically.
Berlin – The AfD has for the first time overtaken the SPD in the Emnid Sunday trend for the picture on Sunday nationwide.
In the weekly poll of the Opinion Research Institute, the AfD increases by one counter to 17%, the SPD scores one point compared to the previous week and reaches 16%.
CDU and CSU also lose a meter and reach only 27%.
This is the deepest value for the Union to date in the Sunday trend.
The Greens reach 15%, the Left 11%, and the FDP 10%.
If a Bundestag election were held on Sunday, according to Emnid, the governing parties would receive only 43% of the votes together.
As a result, the large coalition has now lost the majority on the Sunday issue at all major research institutes, with the exception of Allensbach.
The governing parties are consistently accounting for 43 to 45 percent of the votes (Allensbach: 51 percent).
Together, they received 53.4% in the 2017 Bundestag elections.
Among the other parties, the range is also large: the AfD, the second-largest party in several surveys, is 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens reach 12.5 to 17% of the votes.
The left is on average 10 percent, while FDP is 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3% upwards and downwards, depending on the percentage of votes.
But support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has also fallen significantly since the 2017 Bundestag election.
Currently, only 48% of citizens find that Merkel is the right one in the Chancellery, as the Emnid survey on behalf of BamS showed.
According to the survey, only one in two (50%) wants the big coalition to hold in three years until the next regular Bundestag election, while 41% are in favour of a new election.
A further survey published on Saturday also showed significant loss of popularity for Merkel.
Divided, the Germans also assess whether Merkel should stand for the CDU presidency again in December.
According to Emnid, 47% are in favour of this, while 44% are against it.
As a result, 64% of the Union's supporters do not want candidacy, 35% do not.
Appendix at Aldi: Preisreduziert zum Liebesglück
Will Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Anyone who says there are no more romantic knowledge stories in Tinder's days should talk about turkey at Aldi.
Munich – In times of digital "fast food dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket is almost an anachronistic romance as a place to get to know great love.
Yes, right, talking about reduced turkey meat, boxershort bargains at the drying table, or the favorite pudding is doubtless still a better story for later grandchildren than just a swipe to the right.
The Tinder app is called to be a sluggish stock exchange rather than a contact.
We have dared to test: how do women react, not talking about the hot broad in the first news for a long time?
This is the amazing result.
True Hollywood Lovestory ’ s potential is when love precedes an out-of-eye-lost and-found plot.
If the guy contacts his friends at the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch @ gmx.de, then that sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and consorts - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
For example, the author of this announcement in an unknown Aldi branch wishes that she will find her dream man, with whom she has briefly discussed the "30% reduced organic turkey meat."
She has definitely earned her Happy End à la Hollywood for believing in the magic of analog knowledge.

Football: Reus and Zorc demand silence for idols
Leverkusen (DPA) - BVB sports director Michael Zorc and Captain Marco Reus called for an end to the public debate on the form and fitness of Mario Götze.
"We should stop thinking about Mario.
This is not good for the boy.

Football: Bezirksliga: researcher VfL Wolbeck ’ s appearance against SC Altenrheine encourages
There were moments in this young season when Alois Fetsch went to court with his own.
He gave himself a word career, the coach of the football district religious VfL Wolbeck, withdrew for the first time (internally) to condemn the lack of willingness to perform on the green.
All history.
It is now running around the Brandhoveweg again.
Fresh evidence is 1: 1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrheine, but only thinly passed by the rise during the previous season.
Yes, I am very pleased with the performance.
"We have narrowed the rooms and put pressure on the ball.
This could be seen ," Fetsch praised his guys and looked for the game for everyone to simply say" thank you "for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to change the system after 26 minutes.
Following Nico Frerichs' injury (muscular problems) - Luca Rehberg came for him - the 4-4-2 was almost seamlessly transferred to a 4-2-3-1 in which Niklas Thewes was waiting for balls in the front.
Wolbeck had significantly more gambling in the first section.
And opportunities.
But Frerichs before his out (17th), the replaced Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the leadership.
This would almost have happened when, in minute 41, the SCA, in person by Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer, held himself dangerously in front of Wolbecker's box - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his field.
After the break, the VfL took full control.
Thewes, 18 metres, failed almost.
Schroer also came too late after 58 minutes of the Thewes administration.
With Miles Geske, Fetsch left again missed a fresh cell cure.
When old-fashioned Chris Naberbäumer dropped Robin Westhue in the 70th minute, there was an indirect release of spacers 18 meters outside the guest housing.
The scoundrel himself appeared and demonstrated his dangers with standards.
Westhue ’ s right-wing thing hit the bottom left from the shooter ’ s point of view – 1: 0 (71).
20 more minutes, which should become damn long.
And then that: VfL Captain Florian Quabeck flew the leather in the penalty room unfortunately in the 80th minute.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79.).
For fierce minutes Wolbeck had to survive in the final phase before Geske had the victory hit on his bush in the 87th minute, from twelve meters.
Perhaps it would have been too much good.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26. L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66. Geske) - Thewes

Eintracht Frankfurt wins 4: 1 against Hanover 96
Starting point: four points after five days – that could not be enough for coach Adi Hütter.
Against Hanover 96, Eintracht Frankfurt finally wanted to win home.
Stürmer Ante Rebic, who was in the Starf for the first time after an injury, should help.
Medium-field player Luca Torró was also back after a foam injury and was supposed to prevent SGE from collecting further gates according to standards with his headball strength.

Looking back: against Borussia Mönchengladbach, Eintracht Frankfurt loses the analysis of our sports journalists Ingo Durstewitz and Thomas Kilchenstein after a disappointing achievement of 1: 3.

Report by the Allbright Foundation: women remain rare in boards of companies
As shown in the report "The Power of Monoculture," which will be officially presented this Monday by the Allbright Foundation and presented to the German Press Agency, only 8% of the boards were female on 1 September.
"Companies will have to take a different approach, otherwise international competitors will pass by them," said Managing Director Wiebke Ankersen.
In the us, Britain, or Sweden, purely male-occupied leaderships – with few exceptions – are no longer possible.
The gap makes German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and forward-looking.
It is a different business culture.
Moreover, the small increase in the proportion of women among German stock exchanges was due solely to positive impetus for the companies of the Medium-Sized Values Index (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.8% of the boards are female.
However, in the previous year, the figure was still 3.8%.
Among the 30 Dax companies, women's share has stagnated in recent years.
Recently, 26 women worked in the boards.
"I am sure that next year, Dax companies will again recruit consistent women in their own interest," said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement had signalled that they would not continue to commit themselves to increasing the proportion of "zero percent" so far.
A different picture emerges from the Supervisory Boards: on 1 September, the proportion of women was 30.5% - 45 women more and 68 men less than a year ago.
"If an equal number of women were recruited annually for the boards, they would have reached 40% by 2023," the report says.
Some even make mieses: luxury causes: which manufacturer earns the most per car?
Ferrari deserves the best.
With each Ferrari sold, the Italians take €280,000 and make €69,000 in operating profit.
Big cars, big profits: this slogan is still valid today - in most cases.
Who makes the most profit per car among the noble suppliers.
Munich – Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: how much do luxury manufacturers collect per car they sell?
"Autopapst" and Professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer addressed this issue.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
Ferrari made €69,000 in operating profit in the first half of the year with each car sold - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only comes to about €800, Tesla and Bentley even lay strong on each car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the race, with prices of an average of 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros before interest and taxes.

The 46-year-old emergency car driver had crossed a red light on Saturday afternoon with blue light and Martinshorn.
He then came together on a crossing with a taxi driving by Green.
After the collision, the doctor's car tore against a traffic lights and a tree.
He recorded the passant who died at the accident site.
Emergency car driver and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the emergency car driver were seriously injured in their vehicles and had to be released from operational forces.
The same severely injured 29-year-old emergency physician could free herself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another emergency physician tried to do so, but without success.
The three serious injuries were taken to hospitals.
The police, in close coordination with the Bonn prosecutor's office, determine who is responsible for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, we are uncomfortable for Mourinho
Manchester United is now also losing in the seventh round of the Premier League after the flagging out of the League.
Against West Ham United, ManU is 1: 3rd to talk about the way the defeat is likely to take place.
The scene was symbolic in the 74th minute, in which the renewed Marko Arnautovic shot 3-1 for West Ham; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford supposedly brought the Red Devils back into play.
As they suspected an offside at Mark Nobel ’ s pass, all of Manchester ’ s defense players remained standing, leaving Arnautovic all the time in the world to shoot the ball past the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative culmination of a previously inadequate performance over long distances.
The situation at Uniteds Stadtrivale Manchester City is quite different.
The citizens trained by Mourinhos ’ s big competitor Pep Guardiola came to an approximate 2-0 victory against Brighton & Hove Albion.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke through the defensive bar of the outsider for the home team for the first time.
After a good hour and a double pass with the former goaltender, Sergio Agüero made sure that the sixth victory in the seventh game was achieved, and thus also that the top of the table was jumped.
Liverpool discontinued table leader
Three days after the 1: 2 defeat at the Ligacup, Xherdan Shaqiri fought 1: 1 with Liverpool in the Premier League against Chelsea.
As with the Cup-Aus, Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man in London.
The 27-year-old's 25 minute hit remained the only match hit until the final stage.
Shaqiri, who came into the field for Mohamed Salah in the 66th minute, missed the balance after 70 minutes.
In the 89th minute, Daniel Sturridge made it better with his Schlenzer.
So, having started the speeches with an impeccable balance sheet in the week, Chelsea could not beat for the second time.
First, the Londoners eliminated Jürgen Klopp ’ s team in the Cup, and through the league ’ s remission, the Blues Liverpool now topped the table.
Like city, the two London clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) celebrated 2-0 victories.
But the fans of the Gunners who played Granit Xhaka had to tolerate a success story against the surprise team from Hertfordshire County until 81 minutes.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defenseman Craig Cathcart bugged an injection of Alex Iwobi unfortunately into his own gate, and only two minutes later, Mesut Özil made the decision with his third season hit.
Arsenal passed Watford thanks to the fifth consecutive victory and is now directly behind the great rival Tottenham in rank 5. a strong impression continues to leave Wolverhampton under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The wolves remained unbeaten at 2: 0 against Southampton in the league for the fifth time in a row and ranked 8th.
VW core brand missing: Parisian automobile salon under the diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years alternately with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris – Officially no issue, yet ubiquitous: the diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofitting should not release German car companies at the Paris industry meeting.
At the 2018 Motor Show, they will be showing their innovations from next week together with competition from around the world in the French capital.
Diesel actually no longer plays a major role in this.
However, the possible exchange and upgrading offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are to be negotiated with the government in Berlin until then, should still be an important issue, at least behind the glowing scenes of the exhibition stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: although the Volkswagen Group is involved with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, it is not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are present and have, among other things, their first pure electrical models: the e-tron of the Ingolstädter is due to be launched at the end of the year, the EQC of Stuttgart 2019.
But both have already been officially presented.
BMW's iNext is due to start in 2021.
Paris focuses on the new 3rd round.
A total of more than 250 exhibitors will be represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle manufacturers as well as numerous mobility services and software providers are present in their own halls.
The exhibition, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years alternately with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, almost one million visitors came.
The severe earthquake and subsequent tsunami killed at least 380 people on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
The island was shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake was 5,9, the second was 7,4.
Communications and transport links have been damaged and enormous material damage has occurred.
After the quakes, the tsunami broke across the western coast of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach in the coastal town of Palu for a celebration.
The number of victims is feared to rise significantly.
So far, the figures come only from Palu.
Many other municipalities along the west coast of Sulawesis are also affected.
About 150 bikers celebrate divine service in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final divine service for motorcyclists in the Peace Church in Eveking on Sunday with a team of assistants.
Werdohl – The square in front of the peace church in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final divine service for the bikers was on the agenda.
Frank Schröder is the motor passenger within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and is therefore responsible for the pastoral concerns of the PS-strong two-wheelers.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle divine service (MoGo) takes place at Haus Nordhelle on the last Sunday of a month.
The bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the peace church in Eveking.
Around 150 bikers met there on Sunday to do anything other than ordinary divine service.
As early as 10 a.m., the cars were in front of the church's entrance portal.
First, the biker's breakfast cap was on the agenda and it could be strengthened with coffee and cakes or even with a delicious curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, there were also the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach.
The sermon was held during the Biker divine service by Father Dirk Grzegorek.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill was responsible for the musical support.
"Although bikers prefer blues rock, Valerie Lill suggests rather poetic and calm tones," said Rev. Frank Schröder.
This, too, was certainly a novelty in the history of motorcycle service yesterday.
Füchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates a big celebration: after the apple the milk comes
Borisch was also active on the actual day of action.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also attracted great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and showed his amazing viewers step by step the process from mature apple to apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and let them fill the apples in the large hopper.
With a little muscle strength, the apples became a finely crushed mass.
Not many of the children could yet imagine how it should become a tasty drink.
But they were also able to look at this important step this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in shapes and wrapped in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the apple piece, a little bit like chicken, layer by layer on top of each other.
Thanks to some technical assistance, the last step was no longer so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice gradually flowed into a large container.
But the farmer of the Füchtorfer farmer had already completed specialties.
He opened his "treasure chest" and presented the latest feather white to the older visitors.
The demand for a good drop of "Made in Füchtorf" was correspondingly high.
In a cozy atmosphere, the parents talked, while the children could not only follow the apple pressing process, but also discovered the built-up bouncing castle for themselves.
Former soldiers' comradeship of the Füchtorfer campaign also engaged in the celebration and invited some stations to play games.
The home club will also offer a day of action next year.
Then, however, Gregor Krützkamp emphasised, the hometown in the heart of the asparagus village will not be the place of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the issue: after all, milk will be around it.
1: 4 against Frankfurt: Hanover with fourth season lead: "Situation passed"
Frankfurt / Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat, coach André Breitenreiter gathered around his disappointed Hanover pros 96 and courageously agreed to them.
However, there was not much positive earlier in the 1: 4 (0: 2) tablet at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It is an obscure situation, but it is necessary to get out as a team," said President Schwegler, 96-football professor, saying, "This is, of course, disappointing, because one is always doing a lot."
The further victorious Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86th) joined, stands at the bottom with two counters and is a candidate for descent in its current constitution.
Leading by the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt, on the other hand, celebrated the first season home victory.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45 + 1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59th) and Luka Jovic (89th) achieved the goals of the DFB Cup winner, who, after the successful rehearsal for the Europa-League-game against Lazio, scored seven points in Rome the average field of the table is proposed.
Croatia ’ s Vice-World Champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous open-air debut in Hesse and never got under control of Hanover ’ s defense.
After the World Cup, the stormster, with its pace and enforcement capacity, showed why it is so valuable for reconciliation.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan borrowed from Liverpool FC was also the first time in the early formation of the Frankfurt people, who began swinging.
For the first time, Lucas Torró's fake headball (17th) was in danger.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller, in a promising position, was stopped at the last moment by the 96-defense against the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-term failed Kevin Wimmer (back).
Leadership for housekeepers fell almost inevitably and completely deserved.
Mr Kostic took the ball into the penalty room after a defended corner, while Haller extended his head outside the gate, where Ndicka only needed to hold his foot.
It was the first Bundesligatreffer for the defensive player arrived in the summer by the French second-ligist AJ Auxerre.
And Frankfurt postponed before the break.
This time Haller took care of his storm partner Rebic, who skilled himself and left the 96-torwart Michael Esser with no chance.
In the mid-term, Hanover-Coach Breitenreiter responded to the weak imagination of his eleven and brought two new offensive forces to Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
Although the Lower Saxons were now playing a little more courageously forward, igniting ideas remained until the end when the successor succeeded.
Hessen was much more efficient.
After just an hour, Rebic launched a solo and then laid across De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty gate.
The rest was just shopping for Frankfurt ’ s excessive guests, and Jovic met one minute before the end.
The Morlaix Square becomes the party mile
Crackling Despite cooler temperatures, there was a good atmosphere at the Oktoberfest in the city centre.
Munich's Mayor Dieter Reiter made it before millions of people at the opening of the 185.

Geisingen: Geisinger Christians Celebrate the Holy Cross Festival
The Geising Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross Festival on or after 14 September.
The festive service takes place in the city church, followed by a procession to the Church of the Holy Cross with the final blessing.
The Holy Cross church houses the Christ who was shot from the 30-year war and who, according to legend, was supposed to have shot a Swedish soldier.
Blood flowed from the shot wound.
This led to a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ, which then led to the construction of the Church of the Holy Cross.
It has not yet been built, only the altar room stands, and the lack of a long-distance is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, pastor Adolf Buhl recalls that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort, and life.
The divine service was poorly visited, despite its importance for the Geisinger parish.
After the divine service, the procession to the Church of the Holy Cross took place and the final blessing brought to an end the ecclesiastical part of the Feast of the Cross.
For many years, the Catholic church choir has been inviting to the Catholic parish for the secular part of the feast.
The members of the choir provided visitors with savoury meals and a wide selection of cakes and cakes adapted to the weather, farm holidays.
In the afternoon, the parish offered guided tours around the city church, and on behalf of the parish, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed visitors about the damage to the façade, the roof, the sandstone work and the windows, as well as the following construction measures: they will move next year.
Since the scaffolding has been in place for some time, the damage has been more precisely identified and the individual calls for tender have been more concretely prepared.
It is certain that renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage already occurred a few years ago has been increased, but more has also been noted, which was only possible through the scaffolding of the inaugural appearance.
Socket cleaning is completed, natural stone work is to be started before winter and it is hoped that more than half of this work will be completed this year.
Inauguration: new home in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens a new home for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
The fact that a "very special house" is now being handed over to Münsterblickstraße was agreed by all those present at the inauguration date.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the Donau-Iller residence for some time now depend on the special architecture of the new building.
Wider passages, hallways and doors, larger spaces and accessibility for all areas have been taken into account by architect Rudolf Bader in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago, when the former us Army officers ’ building was tested for mobile phone-caped residents: “The house had come in years and was no longer in contemporary equipment, ” Bader R explained. looking back.
In 2016, the excavators moved to demolish the house.
The new building should be as friendly and bright as possible so that residents can feel comfortable in it, the architect says.
Life Aid Donau-Iller opens new residence
Around €4.6 million was invested in life support for new buildings.
The Free State allocated €2.4 million to the district of Swabia and €450000 to the district of Swabia.
According to architect Bader, the construction work has remained within the planned framework, both temporally and financially.
Jürgen Heinz, Managing Director of Lebenshilfe, thanked him for this.
The spaghetti between barrier-free and fire-proof construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many specifications that would give the inhabitants the freedom to move without any help.
Similarly, Gertrud Kreutmayer, Head of the Social Administration of the Swabian district, said: "The house is based on the special needs of its inhabitants, who need tools to be mobile."
Habitat and functionality were well combined, Kreutmayer said.
And further: "The land in this situation is a real luck, because it is no longer available in today's situation."
In total, the new home in Münsterblickstraße provides space of almost 1500 square meters for 30 people with disabilities, divided into three residential groups.
Heinz, life support manager, is proud of the eleven full-time workers, all of whom are employed on a tariff basis.
Germany: Switzerland complains about differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the day of unity, the SPD Vice-President, Manuela Schwesig, has appealed to all compatriots not to discriminate against the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unity.
We cannot be satisfied with these differences ," said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to the" Sunday mirror ."
The aim must remain to achieve equal living conditions throughout the country.
It was unacceptable that East Germans worked on average longer than people in West Germany, but received 15% less salary.
"I cannot explain this to anyone almost 30 years after German unity," said Schwesig.
North Korea: does this clean dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan hunting dog is supposed to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has given South Korean President Moon Jae In two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs.
As Moon ’ s office announced on Sunday, the two dogs, about one year old, reached their recipients on Thursday.
They therefore passed the border town of Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog food to make it easier for the animals to get involved.
The dogs with the thick white coat, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The gift of friendship was announced by the North at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in mid-September.
Both countries also agreed to jointly participate in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and jointly apply for the 2032 Olympic Games.
In the course of mutual rapprochement, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for missile propulsion.
Austria's moving history reflected in 99 documents
What is Austria?
For the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated in this commemorative year for almost ten months now, many new books have been published, most of which answer this question in the light of the last hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director-general of the Austrian State Archive, put it quite differently in the magnificent "picture book" of Austria, which will be published on 1 October.
New Week, New Chance for the Government
Back to work – the unofficial motto for the Great Coalition ’ s working week beginning today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and her ministers from CDU, SPD and CSU did not recently mantraly swear the "return to work."
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other working citizens in this country to the legitimate question of what is actually the difference between labour and non-work, but be it.
If the federal government is now ready to return to its mission of governing, it should not be stopped now with conceptual debates.
Whether the Union and the SPD can actually do something together after the provocations and bubbles of recent weeks may already be demonstrated by Monday.
In the evening, leaders of the governing parties will meet for the Coalition Committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round regularly to defuse conflicts early; a lesson from all the dispute.
First of all, however, conflict-ridden issues are on the agenda again with the diesel retrofitting and the law on immigration of skilled workers.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to let the car companies out with exchange fees, while SPD and CDU see manufacturers as obliged to retrofit older diesel.
While the diesel crisis has seen a convergence over the weekend, the Union and the SPD are still far apart in the planned law on immigration of skilled workers.
The SPD calls for a perspective of staying for rejected asylum seekers who work or train.
The Union is strongly opposed to "changing track" from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be another dispute among the coalition partners – and how should it be different?
Not equal or equal, but three partners with very different societal patterns and priorities.
The dispute is good.
Without a dispute, a society of such diverse and sometimes contradictory interests will not progress.
However, in order to be constructive, a dispute must not be rebuilt for party-actical reasons on the question of being or not being.
It is still about politics, not theatres.
The Union and the SPD should fight, always looking at the reality of people's lives.
What is feasible and beneficial for many?
This guiding issue is a pragmatic solution to both diesel and gauge-change issues, and thus restores confidence.
This is why the people ’ s parties must fight now.
Fungus checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister for Foreign Affairs
Is the Minister of Labour exactly in breach of existing labour law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"Really day and night" had her legists worked on social security reform, an exaggerated social minister reported during the presentation of the same two weeks ago.
In the case of List-Pilz-Mandator Daniela Holzinger, the statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) is astonished - she is now bringing the matter to Parliament by request.
She assumed that "the Minister would only express her enthusiasm for her team's deployment and would not wish to announce any violations of existing civil service law on current cameras."
Nevertheless, she now has questions in order to "free Haritants from any suspicion."
Police open a street in search of women's corpses
Marx Green - Long did not want the police to comment on this.
There is now a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, the state road between Naila and Bad Steben has been dug.
The route is closed until Monday in the Marx Green area.
Preceded by the fact that investigators had previously used an archaeological dog.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of an old human bone, could finally, together with its leader, restrict the relevant position to a few metres in several applications.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the highest Bavarian monument protection authority in the area of the said road.
For more than a year now, the Prosecutor's Office and the Criminal Police Court have been dealing with the missing case.
Again and again, Marxgrün closed a bicycle path and examined it with sonar devices, because investigators suspect that Heike's body could have been hidden here during the reconstruction of the state road 30 years ago.
Colour powder and eggs: crawals in Barcelona before Catalonia anniversary
On Monday, the disputed referendum on independence will be held in Catalonia for the first time.
But it is already happening before that.
Separatists have not forgotten the police mission of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan referendum on independence of 1 October 2017, there were clashes between separatists and the police in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by independence advocates, among other things, with colour powder to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the national police and the Civil Guard.
Some 3000 police officers from Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to honour their colleagues during the referendum in the polling stations last year with a rally.
The attempt to prevent citizens from voting was also violent at the time.
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of separatists and central government security forces separate, Spanish media reported.
Some of the approximately 6,000 separatists would then have tried violently to break the police chain, throwing officials, among other things, with paint bags and eggs.
Six people were arrested and 24 others were slightly injured, it was stated by reference to the authorities.
The independence referendum will be held for the first time on Monday.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision on the decoupling of the wealthy region of Spain, the central government in Madrid put Catalonia under forced management in the autumn of 2017.
The then regional president, Carles Puigdemont, fled to exile in Belgium.
Other politicians also moved abroad.
On the other hand, several ministers of the then regional government and other separatist movement activists remain in U-Haft.
In December, new elections were held in the region.
Following the entry into office of the new Catalan government in May, the forced administration was terminated.
But the new regional president, Quim Torra, also insists on the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: gathered Councillessness: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen split torn apart
Red-white Ahlen continues to replace.
In FC Gütersloh, too, only one 0-0 difference was sufficient.
The final light and the third last turned out to be a gathered ratlessness in front of 438 spectators at the Heidewaldstadion.
The first half was easily understood by the entertainment factor.
So anyone who preferred to get a beer or a sausage could do so without worry.
There was no danger of missing a torch chance, because there was virtually none.
First shot after half an hour
Güterslohs Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) scoring of the entire game at 28 minutes.
The best – and in principle the only real – option was when Cihan Yilmaz FCG-torwart Frederic Westergerling forced a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the criminal space border.
The hosts were even more harmless.
Their most effective action consisted of an early change.
Storm Lars Schröder had to be exchanged because of the injury, and Sinan Aygün came for him.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the increasing boredom.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mützel was 18 metres above the housing, and after an hour, the freight wicked appeared for the first time offensively.
After a conquest of Matthäus Wieckowicz, it was fixed.
The swiftly presented account of Sinan Aygün "crowned" Nick Flock (62nd) with a shot in the arms of RWA-torwart Bernd Schipmann.
They also purchased a headball by Wieckowicz (66th) after a cornerball by former alderman Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut responded, first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60th) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70th).
It did nothing.
The Ahlens did not achieve more than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative.
It was only in the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but neither did it.
Angelo Daut made an effort to emphasise the positive point: "I like the fact that we have played zero," but unfortunately the zero has also stood in the front.
"This time, we were not as dangerous to peat as we were against wooden winds and that, although our opponent didn't want to play here," said RW Ahlen's interim coach.
Offensively, "everything somewhat plagued" against a team "who only wanted to defend.
At any rate, I did not feel that we could have a counter-tor ," Daut said.
But, as a viewer, his team didn ’ t feel like shooting a goal either.
The idea was too small for that.
Reckenfelder Erntedankmarkt: Luckily there are enough Kreimers
This is welcome by Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Tafelausgabestelle, for which these donations are intended.
Volunteers say: "These donations will also remain in Reckenfeld."
At the opening, the sky was bright blue, but the place was still somewhat empty, but that should change in the course of the day.
Because: "It is so beautifully sociable here, that is why we are here today," said a visitor.
As always, the organiser of the Festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit with an ordinary pinch of humour.
For the couple Brockmann, who should actually be weighed against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer intervened in the short term.
Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are enough Kreimers.
And the "replacement" could not be used to interfere with the ever-increasing number of visitors.
This was so good that some folk songs were sung at a later hour.
"Just great," said Marcel Kreimer.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to place the opening date in his schedule this time.
He welcomes the many activities with their booths, mostly associations.
"Actually, there should be no such thing as a board," he thanked for the action of the male choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the commitment of all those involved in the booths and also included the other festivals held in September and the "clean up" campaign.
Our garden town has a colourful painting - something goes on.
The mayors of Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück were then removed with the help of the fire brigade and taken to the winter quarter.
Work has been done on many levels for physical well-being.
From sweet to heartfelt, everything was to be done.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has been living in Reckenfeld for only a year, became creative in his decoupled saw.
Furnierarbeiten, Bierdeckel mit Reckenfelder Motiven and some more were on offer.
A specialty was offered by three horseback fields of beekeepers: "Reckenfelder Honig," brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter has a specialty.
Honey cake in glass, of course with honey from my own production.
Since the little Elsa had to regain access again and again, the cake tasted so good.
It is the conviviality that has allowed visitors to spend a long time in the evening, even without a stage programme that does not exist at the Autumn Festival.
Lubricants with a local political message: No successful advertising for skate installations
In Lengerich, unknown people have probably promoted the construction of a skate plant in a very difficult way.
There are appropriate lubricants in several places, says Jürgen Kohne from the municipality on request of the WN.
In at least one case, the police have been prosecuted for damage to property.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark für Lengerich!" appeared on signs at the Gempt Hall and the Old Town Hall, among others.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reported that a corresponding letter had already been discovered on the advertising sign at the staircase to the Gempt bistro after the vocational election fair on 19 September.
Since the brief message at the time had appeared to be "only" with an edding, it could easily have been removed.
"A few days later, however, it was again, this time sprayed," said Rottmann.
It assumes that the corresponding advertising sign must be replaced.
This case is particularly marked by the fact that several large Lengerich companies are also mentioned on the board.
If the skate facility is built, it will also be made possible by sponsors.
There have already been commitments, Jörg Hesselmann, from the municipal department of school, sport and culture, without giving any names.
But it is well possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those on the lubricated board.
Local policy and administration have been dealing with skate equipment for years.
After the old at the fibre clinic had been dismantled, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
Finally, the Council voted in favour of the fire brigade parking.
However, this intention has not been implemented - too many factors seemed to oppose a construction at this point.
A reversal followed at the end of June.
The members of the Central and Financial Committee have now voted unanimously in favour of the Gutenberg School area.
On the state of play, Jürgen Kohne says that the administration is currently in the midst of concrete planning.
The last word was then given to the City Council.
It follows a decision this year so that a positive vote could be built in 2019.
Bottleneck in air traffic control is getting worse
Frankfurt / Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, German air traffic controllers do not see any signs of improvement next year.
"This year we had a wind, 2019 we will have a strong wind and then the storm will come," said the chief of the air traffic control union, Matthias Maas, the German press agency before the aviation summit in Hamburg on 5 October.
An important reason for the many delays and loss of flights was the long-known staff shortage in European air traffic controls, for which there was no quick solution.
"Airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new pilots takes four to five years," said the trade unionist.
Throughout Europe, the market for ready-to-train pilots was empty.
Around a hundred people were missing in the centre of Karlsruhe alone to monitor the upper German airspace.
Maas once again criticised the fact that various aviation trade unions were not invited to the Summit.
In the Hanseatic city on Friday, representatives of the federal government, the countries, air traffic control, airlines and airports will meet to address the causes of delays.
"If we want to talk about additional work and overtime, this will not happen without us," said the GdF chief, who has many members in the German air traffic control system.
Maas once again made the Commission's guidelines responsible for pilotage.
Transport forecasts for the current regulatory period until 2019 were far too low.
The resulting cost targets and staff savings in national air traffic controls are now fully in line with operational business.
Maas called on Federal Minister of Transport Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to work in Brussels towards regulations that "don't make air traffic controls any further."
At present, the EU targets would be coordinated by 2024 and further tightening would be feared.
The EU is subject to constant lobbying by airlines.
"Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now harvesting exactly what they have sown themselves in recent years," said Maas.
He hoped that the high delay costs for airlines would trigger a rethink.
GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if the German Air Traffic Management (DFS) offers a "coherent training and future pact," said Maas.
The announced admission of 120 pilot pupils per year over the next five years is just enough to compensate for age-related exits.
The necessary staff development is not yet linked to this.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board votes for group restructuring
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously in favour of the Group's restructuring plans.
Following the will of Thyssenkrupp Interim Director Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed Chairman of the Board at the Sunday meeting, the crisis group will be divided into two independent companies.
Both companies should be based in Essen and listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional cuts in staff beyond the already known cuts in the administration.
After two withdrawals, the supervisory body counts on the capital side only eight heads.
Ten employees' representatives are present.
However, the final decision is expected to be taken by an Annual General Meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG will include, among other things, the 50% share of the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
The second Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG will combine the business with lifts and supplies.
Barcelona: violence in demos by police and Catalan independence advocates.
Two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police and Catalan independence advocates in Barcelona have resulted in violent clashes with many injured.
According to the city administration, around 3000 policemen from all over Spain gathered on Saturday and around 6,000 independence advocates demonstrated.
The Catalan police have tried to keep the two protests away from each other with a big offer.
According to the task force, however, independence advocates have repeatedly attempted to break the security barrier.
They had attacked the officials with paint and bullets.
According to the information, there were also ranges between the participants in the various protests.
Rescue workers reported that 24 people were injured.
The police reported that there were six arrests.
Better pay and appreciation of colleagues
With their demonstration, the police wanted to pay tribute to the colleagues who had campaigned against the independence referendum in Catalonia almost exactly a year ago, prohibited by the Spanish central government.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and Guardia Civil find it unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers deserve much more than they do.
The demonstrators perceived it as a provocation that the Spanish police exactly demonstrated in Barcelona.
"Why have they come to protest here?" asked the 55-year-old Catalan demonstrator Manel Perez of the AFP News Agency.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they cheated on us a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to give his name to Daniel, rejected the allegation.
"Of course, we want to support our comrades who did their duty last year: defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is in favour of enforcing our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona because it is a great European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues were "not come to provoke," the policeman assured him.
Breakdown permits access to personal data of British Ministers
A security gap in a mobile app has led to the personal data of ministers and members of the Conservative British Tory Party being temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to UK media reports, several ministers received calls from unknowns after the breakdown was announced one day before the Tory Congress in Birmingham.

Football: Juve coaches praise by lead: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese star striker "played the best game this evening together with the half-hour of Valencia," Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri praised the record champion's 3: 1 (1: 1) victory against the SSC of Naples.
For the coach, the expensively purchased star, even without its own gate, was the decisive man in the important game against the persecutor.
"Ronaldo has had a lot of fun and does it well," said Allegri.
Even though we have begun tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and we have grown from now on.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three goals, Juve turned the game after the early delay through Dries Mertens' hit (10 minutes) and hung the worst persecutor for the time being.
The Torjäger, who was picked up by Real Madrid, initially appointed Mario Mandzukic, former Bundesliga professor, who took the lead with a double pack (26 / 49).
And after a corner per headball, Ronaldo was also preparing for the hits of chief defense Leonardo Bonucci (76), who only had to put in shortly before the gate.
"He gives many templates," the coach praised.
But Allegri, of course, wants to see gates from the attacker who is the record shooter both in the Champions League and in the Portuguese national team.
"We need to be even better serving him," said the coach.
The best juve shooter is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, Juventus's overpowering power seems to become even more oppressive.
Seven victories in seven games are the flawless series in the A-series. at 21 points, the master of the previous seven years has already made six counters ahead of Naples.
The second table trained by former Bayer Coach Carlo Ancelotti was not chanceless against Turin.
But at the latest following the warning of Mario Rui (58th), the leading player was decided.
The Portuguese had to leave the square after too hard a fight against Paulo Dybala with yellow-red.
"We have played well against a good Naples," said Turin Coach.
Emre Can was also allowed to feel the same way.
The German national player has enforced himself with Juve.
The professional who came from Liverpool FC was employed in all seven league parts.
The midfielder also played in the Champions League game against Valencia, which Allegri said with the "half-hour": Ronaldo flew from the square at the Turiners' 2-0 victory and was locked up for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes his name
With a particularly bizarre performance, rapper Kanye West attended the us TV show "Saturday Night Live" on the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume created headaches and question marks among the spectators.
The 41-year-old also announced a change of name on time for the release of his new album.
From now on, the musician says he can only be called "ye."
"The essence previously known as Kanye West," he twittered in line with the deceased singer Prince when he gave his artist's name.
But the pseudonym is not news.
The tenth album was already released under that name.
In an interview with the KRRL radio station, the artist stated that "Ye" had a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means' you ," says the rapper.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: finally!
Achieved
Hoetmar ’ s trainer Averhage did not make a heal from his disappointment.
That was a weak game from us today.
The opponent was simply tougher, we never put him in trouble ," and the list of Hoetmar's shooting opportunities is correspondingly narrow.
Two scoring opportunities in 90 minutes, rarely allowing games to be positive.
Soccer Circuit League A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst at 0: 2 (0: 1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
SG had only two possibilities in the first passage, but the first used Maik Krause from a pointed angle to early leadership (7).
In the 43rd minute, Steffen could have increased Uphus, but after Krause's great preparatory work, he changed his freedom.
The hosts had only a double option when Moritz Höne first failed to scorer Jos Schuhmacher and Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break, guests became even more dominant and had a number of good opportunities.
But Uphus (49), Julian Turl (61) and Heinz Linnemann (69) all awarded.
In addition, Niklas Eilmann could not use a trading meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved his hand on the doorway and saw it as red - for the guests either (75.).
It was only when Nils Berheide pushed the ball across the line that the game was decided (81).
"We had criticised ourselves hard before, which was different today than in recent weeks," said Florian Kraus.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77th Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90th Leibig), Turl.
Goals: 0: 1 Krause (7), 0: 2 Berheide (81).

Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: spectacle football in Albachten: GW Albersloh subject to Concordia at 3: 4
"I don't know what to think of it," he said.
"We didn't get access to the," he supposedly referred to the wing pliers with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, as well as all the other green whites who show up with collective offensive force.
He could still laugh: "a dirty victory," he said, winking cheerfully, and then pulling His players was the relief to note that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Remember, after a duel of two teams, one, Albachten, is playing for the championship, and the other, Albersloh, is fighting for class retention.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes behind him.
"That was by far our best seasonal achievement," he says.
"How we return after 0-2, how we oppose one of the league's top teams throughout the season, that was really phenomenal."
This makes it all the bitter that you now have to go home empty-handed.
Top doorman Lars Zymner led the hosts with his 12th season hit (24).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
He put the 2: 0 on the left side for Fabian Fröhning (39).
We knew that, but such a player cannot be taken out completely.
"That was crazy what he did," Lewandowski recognized the quality of the opponent.
Shortly before the switch, his own elf managed to compensate: McGill's release from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe through the long goal (45).
After the switch, it was again McGill who achieved the compensation (59).
Then it went on and on.
It was a crisp, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64th), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann (69th).
Despite so many, Albersloh was no longer able to reconcile the last Concordia hit (80).
We must now focus our full attention on Wednesday.
"The game against Schapdetten is what we need to win," said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87th Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87th Bareksai).
Goals: 1: 0 Zymner (24), 2: 0 Fröhning (39), 2: 1 McGill (45), 2: 2 McGill (59), 3: 2 Nübel (64), 3: 3 P. Horstmann (69), 4: 3 Jülkenbeck (80).

According to media reports, the entire Bureau of football second-ligist Dynamo Dresden has resigned.
Several media consistently relied on a joint letter from the Saxon body in the evening.

Erdogan in Germany: politics instead of Pomp
It is good that he is gone again.

Evangelische Akademie Tutzing: prominent guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy of Tutzing offers approximately 80 meetings by the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, France ’ s President Emmanuel Macron has signalled that he personally wants to pick up the price of tolerance in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term was too short: as Federal President, he was not in Tutzing ’ s Evangelical Academy.
But before and after Wulff was there.
He was calculated by Academic Director Udo Hahn when he said proudly, "All the Federal Presidents and Chancellors have been with us." The fact that celebrities are repeatedly emerging at the Academy at Tutzing Castle, but was also a t when presenting the annual programme. topic.
At the end of October, songwriter Konstantin Wecker attends a meeting on spiritual experience from a philosophical perspective, and on 29 September, the writer Frido Mann attends a meeting on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, France's President Emmanuel Macron has also pledged to personally receive the "Tolerance Prize" awarded to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which is also awarded to TV presenter Dunja Hayali in another category (we reported).
The approximately 80 meetings until mid-2019 will take place.
"The pension is not certain!" says a conference title.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - the Academy describes the "risky and deadly route across the Mediterranean."
"And on a meeting on Syria:" barbarism without limit ."
Arms terminals, destruction, torture, death - the war is a mockery of any human idea. "
The spectrum ranges from structural racism in society to the gap between rich and poor to radical changes in labour through digitalisation.

Musikkabarett: Geschlechterverständnis mit Herz - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the Hall of the Christ Church in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret woman, Teubner embraced gender understanding, not only with humour and warmth of the heart for the (feeling) woman and the (feeling) man and what else might happen, but also with music.
She used the mini-guitar and mastered her violin.
Ben Süverkrüp was sitting on the wing.
On the one hand, the male savings partner, who sometimes comes to the end of the sentence, on the other, is a true pianist: Süverkrüp Teubner accompanies so congenially that some may have wanted a solo.
This happened, with Beethoven and Chopin, but differently, the way it fitted with the red thread of the evening.
Teubner had brought a paradox into play: satisfaction comes with a man when he has a partner but does not open the door.
By contrast, a closed door without a partner would not be useful.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same thing: what would have emerged from Mozart's composition if "Nannerl" had opened the door unexpectedly?
For example, Süverkrüp moves in improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden" to the "Song of Death," and from Mozart's g minor symphony to a playful dance.
There were great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Flowers were handed over to Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, the Chansonette.
However, President Heidemarie Markenbeck did not receive any additional thanks.
She had the idea of giving the duo a performance in Wolbeck as well as performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt.

Handball: Women's national league: Ahlener SG retains little white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The problems faced by the Ahlen women were mainly with the third-league player Carolin Stallmann, who alone marked ten matches.
"Actually, I was very happy with the defense, only one player has made too many goals.
We didn't get to grips with them, "said Dogan Aydogdu, ASG coach.
But he was more annoyed by the many opportunities he had left behind.
In conclusion, his team was missing this time.
The ASG therefore lagged behind almost until the end, with a break of 11: 12 and later a break of 15: 18 (45).
Only towards the end did the wider host bank become critically visible.
In addition, Aydogdu put Merle Klement on the left side, who then made "extremely clever the crucial goals" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pumpe, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5 / 3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3rd League Women: top performance of BSV Ostbevern at VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the leading game, BSV Ostbevern ’ s volleyball women have re-established themselves in the leading group of the 3rd League West.
In the second-league descendant VC Allbau Essen, the blue-white won at 3: 1.
"This was a huge step forward for a cool season.
It makes Lenz play in the upper third of the league.
This is what we have now done ," Trainer Dominik Münch was pleased with an almost impeccable achievement of his team at the top of the table.
The first passage was dominated by guests almost as they wanted.
Over 4: 1, 16: 10 and 22: 12, he went to the Vice-Master of the previous year at 25: 15.
Food has been accepted in two bars, but has not come into play.
We have worked well on them.
Our opponent has taken a high risk, but has also produced a number of tickets.
In the second sentence, the BSV already operated at 12: 8 "Essen has switched the adoption to three-bar.
We could not keep up the pressure.
Food sucked and we got a little lulled ," Münch continued.
At 18: 17, volleyball women from the Ruhr region had their first nose in front.
Although Ostbevern rejected four more sentence balls at 19: 24, the fifth attempt found its objective.
"The game was now a better class," said the exercise manager at an increasing level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed significantly to the BSV's application of the leaf in the third section from 14: 16 to 25: 21.
Münch: "We have played consistently and calmly."
Over 7: 3 and 15: 13, the Blue-White passage brought four with 25: 22.
Vera Horstmann was elected as the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier had also caught an excellent day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish community: mosque opening as a missed opportunity
The Turkish Municipality in Germany (TGD) has criticized the way in which Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan inaugurated the great Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
"The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left a cluster in German-Turkish relations that can only be easily converted," said the chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, the German editorial network.
Both the Turkish and the German sides would have missed the opportunity for a joint, conciliatory appearance.
"Instead of emphasizing the Muslims' belonging to Germany side by side with German leaders, Erdogan used the date for his purposes," Sofuoglu complained.
The extensive exclusion of the German public has "strengthened many reservations."
Heimatverein Nottuln: offer has already become established
After the long summer break, the Folktreff season is finally back.
On 18 October (Thursday) at 7.30 p.m., the Heimatverein Nottuln already hosts its fifth folk meeting in the fireplace room of the Old Office.
It is almost exactly a year since we held a folk meeting for the first time.
This event has now become an integral part of the musical calendar of events in Nottuln ," says Hanns Moormann, Chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I would not have thought that our people's meeting would establish itself so quickly in Nottuln.
Whether Friederike ’ s storm head in January or the heat wave in July, the office ’ s fireplace was always fully occupied.
"The programme at the next Folktreff is, as always, a colourful mixture of German folk songs, hiking and sailor songs, folk songs, evergreens and old slag songs," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who repeatedly invites friendly musicians to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer and his accordion pledged for the first folk meeting "birthday."
He has been a member of "Gaitling" for many years, a group from the Steinfurt neighbourhood that played music with flat German lyrics.
He is now on his way with an Irish folk band.
The people's performers like to remember the last event in the summer when Christoph Schulz of the Folktreff Emsdetten enthused the audience with his international version of the song "Frösche in der Nacht" and sent them home with an earworm.
"We expect many cheerful guests to spend another sociable and humorous evening," states the invitation of the home club.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to play an active role is invited to participate.
As the desired seats are always quickly occupied, it is recommended that there be enough time.
The Folk Meeting starts at 7.30 p.m. but admission is already at 7 p.m.
China approves proposed merger between Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking a further step towards the world's largest industrial gas group.
The Chinese competition authority had approved the proposed merger, Linde announced on Sunday.
This means that the billion-dollar concentration is still subject to permits in South Korea and, as the biggest hurdle, in the us.
Recently, the chances of an insider's approval have improved because Linde has promised to sell additional company shares.
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October so that the merger can succeed.
From pure fruit to ecology
The 125th anniversary of the district association for horticulture and land care was celebrated with a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle.
On 29 September 1893, a fruit show at the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus gave the last impetus to found the Kulmbach district association for horticulture and land care, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a big anniversary on Saturday evening in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle.
However, he was then called a different name: as "district building association Kulmbach Stadt und Land," he was baptized in 1893 by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa.
The purpose of the fruit cultivation association was also different from today's work - it was in fact purely fruit cultivation, nobody thought about flowers and horticulture at the time.
"At the time of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of elites," said district caregiver Günter Dippold in his ceremony.
Fruit trees should be lined by roads, and so-called industrial gardens were built in schools.
Fruit cultivation is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the municipality of Kulmbach, which comprise nearly 7000 members.
But this is far from exhausting the spectrum.
Natural horticulture, biological plant protection, village beauty and nutrition play an equally important role as knowledge transfer, healthy nutrition and youth work.
How versatile the tasks of a horticultural association are, the members of the Hutschdorf Youth Group "Maulwürfe" showed entertainingly on stage.
"Youth work is urgently needed, particularly in the digital age," said county chairman Günter Reif, and whether Henry Schramm stressed the importance of experiences in nature for life.
Collecting chestnuts was a huge thing for us children, and I doubt that smartphone & Co can be a similar pleasure.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where they should stand," added County Councillor Söllner, stressing the particular importance of horticultural associations for the villages.
The district association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green spaces in the village.
The fact that this is a genuine concern of many horticultural associations in the county leaves no doubt for the district manager and specialist advisor Friedhelm Haun.
He led the many visitors through the long history of the association and reported, among other things, on the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past, everything came out of the garden, and for the winter it was buried.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the utility garden turned into an ornamental and residential garden.
"Nature has existed, it was already there before us and we must follow it," said the expert on fruit and nut trees.
For this reason, horticultural associations would be encouraged not to diminish so that our homeland would remain beautiful and worth living.
This includes welcoming the new citizens in our associations, added the President of the Bavarian Federation, Wolfram Vaitl.
"We must stop the blatant decline in insects that we owe to our children and grandchildren," concluded Günter Reif's successful ceremony, which was solemnly surrounded by the tower glasses of the Thurnau music association.

Priority for Nafta talks: Canada's Foreign Minister moves UN speech
Mexico ’ s government wants clarity on Nafta: they provide both trading partners with an ultimatum for an agreement.
Canada's Foreign Minister now gives absolute priority to the trade agreement - and shifts her speech to the United Nations.
Because of the time pressure in the struggle for a renewal of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the us and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of today's Saturday, the Minister will not speak until Monday before the UN General Assembly, spokesperson Adam Austen announced.
Meanwhile, it focuses on the renegotiation of Nafta.
Mexican Minister of Economy Ildefonso Guajardo stated on Friday that Canada ’ s and the us negotiators would have 48 hours to agree if Canada actually wanted to join the trade agreement already concluded between Canada and the us.
The us and Mexico agreed in August to recast the Nafta Regional Free Trade Agreement.
Us President Donald Trump suggested that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
Talks on a new edition have been ongoing for more than a year.
By Sunday evening (local time), they are to be concluded, and Trump ’ s government intends to present the agreement to the us Senate before October 1.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico ’ s President-elect, Andres Manuel López Obrador, announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against Presidential candidates Bolsonaro
The Brazilian presidential candidate, Jair Bolsonaro, wounded during a trade fair attack, left the hospital.
The extreme right-wing ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro, where he lives, according to a report by the daily "O Globo."
After his dismissal, it remains unclear whether the 63-year-old will perform public appearances in the South American country last week before the presidential elections.
The politician was attacked on the streets during an election campaign in southern Brazil in early September.
Meanwhile, thousands of people went to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "Der nicht"), women's associations in particular had called for protests against the former military.
In the social networks, too, the associations made racist and anti-women's statements against Bolsonaros mobile.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In Brasilia ’ s capital, the protests were mixed with a rally by Fernando Haddad, the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers ’ Party (PT).
He replaced former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to twelve years in prison for corruption and must not therefore be candidates.
The presidential election in Brazil will take place on 7 October.
As an ex-mayor of the millionaire city of São Paulo, in surveys, Haddad was far behind the far-right candidate, Bolsonaro.
Although the "Trump of Brazil" has been involved in politics for a long time, it recently presents itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates reaches the absolute majority during the first round of elections, there will be a general election on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not succeed, no matter whom he opposes.
Bolsonaro is known to be rushing against homosexuals and blacks and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
He is repeatedly shocked by verbal discharges.
Another time, he said that the supporters of Lula ’ s left labor party should be shot.

After a long illness: Danish rock legend died
The Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 years after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen announced on Larsen's website.
At the deathbed, Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician had been treated for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become famous for the band Gasolin ', which was hugely successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Their songs were influenced by international musical groups such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the band was dissolved in 1978, Larsen was a solo artist.
He sold around three million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album "Midt om natten" is still the most sold album in Denmark.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen praised Larsen on Sunday in a statement as a "street boy" who was "against everything but in every heart."
The Head of Government also recalled that the opponent of the monarchy, Larsen, had occurred in 2010 on the 70th birthday of Danish Queen Margrethe II.
Rock night in the shoe factory: volume at compressed air hammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saw and start a concert evening with the power of a tiger." Only the band names of "Here We Stand," "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" put such a description of the rocky live Saturday night's shoe shoe shop hall nearby: hardrock pure of three other friendly bands.
After the sound check and just before the concert starts, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There is no trace of lamp fever.
After that, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in conjunction with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands excite the approximately 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night visibly.
The Quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika is already convinced by the latest, unknown pieces of his own style and the next CD.
In front of the stage, the band dances for the coherent and compelling interplay.
Although "addition" calls cannot be overheard, "Tiger Bonesaw" leaves the stage to the "Here We Stand" trio.
Guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass, and drummer Kai Hölscher demonstrate that Hardrock is not the same as hardrock, with their alternative sounds, sometimes reminiscent of the classic rock of the 1970 ’ s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers," "Here We Stand" also uses a synthesizer in addition to the guitar rock.
Not only does the longing, almost ballistic "Take Me Home" impress by switching from melodic passages to the guitar-elastic rockriffs of the multi-layered songs.
The Quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuschen has, however, been particularly well known since it was founded in 2005.
Full of agility, the band will present their hardrock on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ignition" has particular stage experience with its performances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis on the 2017 China Tour - is obvious and inexorable.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann, together with the band, is also playing the only conceived song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
The guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a cheerful solo to the sound that is even higher than before, while he runs through the audience.
A certain amount of volume is, of course, part of a hardrock concert of this kind based on gender: the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, according to the mixed-console team, is at the three-person concert of "Here We Stand." ,"" Tiger Bonesaw "and" The Ignition "at about 98 decibels.
This is, for example, at the level of the compressed air hammer, but it is still well below the controls of the Wacken Festival, which "The Ignition" refers to on its website.
However, the audience of Ahlen does not need 120 decibels in nozzle blood, as is the case with the annual metal pitch in the north of the republic.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocky gangart have long convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso game and their own compositions.
"We stand here, have taken the bone saw and ignited a concert evening with the power of a tiger," all three groups, of course in the transmitted sense, can say at the end.
And, above all, enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

A death in the event of a glider accident at Essen / Mülheim airport
A fatal accident has occurred at Mülheim / Essen airport.
A glider crashed on Sunday at a parking lot at Mülheim / Essen airport.
The pilot died in the event of the accident.
A fatal accident occurred on Sunday near Mülheim / Essen airport.
As the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" reported, a glider crashed at the airport's fair park.
The pilot was killed.
As the "WAZ" reported, the student was alone on board - the flyer should be a single-seater.
The aircraft was already on landing at the time of the accident.
The crash site is located only near a landing site at the airport.
But there has been an Octoberfest since this weekend.
Mülheim / Essen airport is located at the city border of the two Ruhr towns and directly at the exit to Highway 52.
From the parking lot there is a park & ride offer at large events at Messe Essen or the Gruga-Halle in Essen.
Trump scowls at Kim, "And then we fell in love"
The fact that us President Kim, North Korea ’ s leader, is well-off despite the nuclear crisis, is no secret.
But now Trump has given his colleague a true declaration of love.
It also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters."
At the tender age of 72, the married us president announced himself a new flame.
The tragic thing is that it is a long-distance relationship.
On Saturday, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un.
In front of supporters in the us state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half-time ruler ’ s dynasty in Pyongyang, despite the fact that the struggle for North Korea ’ s nuclear disarmament is proving rather tougher.
"I was hard on him, too, and things went all the way between us," Trump reported.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only the talks with Kim would have made his heart melt.
He wrote me beautiful letters, great letters.
Their personal relationship has also been politically fruitful: Trump referred to Kim ’ s announcement of stopping all nuclear and missile testing, even though critics behind it see little more than lip service.
The us President seemed quite conscious of the affection for the notorious "Rocket Man," Trump's nickname for Kim, whether his Martian threatening gestures were horrible.
In any case, he immediately anticipated the criticism to be expected of his appearance in a large Wheeling sports hall: "Donald Trump says they have fallen in love."
How terrible, how terrible is that?
This is so unpresidential.
Trump said, "I have always told you that it is so easy to be presidential."
But then there wouldn ’ t be 10,000 people out there in this dull-filled arena, but we would have only 200 people out there.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler is well visited, atmospheric and, above all, full of sunshine: very varied and with a good shot of Oktoberfestflair, Baesweiler ’ s city centre has emerged on Sunday.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest did not just take place in the tent at the fire brigade tower, but was extended to the city by the trade association on Sunday.
Refugees rescued from Libyan prison thanks to video
Nigerian refugees have reported their disastrous prison conditions in Libya using a mobile phone video, enabling them to be rescued.
In July, the group had turned the reception into a life-threatening cell in the coastal town of Sawija and disseminated it online.
"They refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The admission was sent to the "France 24 Observers" website, whose editors alerted the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were eventually flown to Nigeria at the end of August.
"We could not have returned to Nigeria without the video," said Efe Onyeka, who had recorded the video, the AFP news agency.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya in an attempt to reach Europe via the Mediterranean.
With the video, he told himself that he was in danger of life.
One of his companions was almost beaten to death by the guards, said Onyeka.
Generally speaking, the conditions of imprisonment were disastrous: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organises the voluntary repatriation of refugees left in Libya.
Some 2,700 Nigerian migrants were sent back home this year through the programme, said IOM spokesman in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the now rescued Nigerians was not exceptional in view of the poor detention conditions in Libya.
However, he has not heard of a mobile phone call.
International organisations have long criticised the state of Libya ’ s refugee camps as being unworthy of humankind.
The North African state, which is dominated by too many militias, is the main transit country for migrants on the way from Africa to Europe.

German was trapped in his own car for days
A 75-year-old has had to stay in his car for several days and nights in a forest area in central Franconia after having arrested the car away from all forest trails and a tree blocking the car door.
Rescue forces happened to discover the car near a pasture on Saturday afternoon and liberate the missing since Tuesday evening, the police announced on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was reported to be in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He announced that he would now look forward to his home.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after he had not returned on Tuesday from a trip with his off-road vehicle across the local meadows and fields.
Despite intensive searches, the man ’ s remainder has remained unclear for days.
Laschet addresses the rule of law in Turkey
In talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Cologne NRW Minister President Armin Laschet (CDU) has indicated that he has called on the rule of law in Turkey.
Relations between the two countries are currently "overshadowed," said Laschet on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne Airport.
This concerns in particular arrest waves, press and religious freedom.
Mr Erdogan "made it clear that if relations are to be normalised in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, the rule of law is a very important prerequisite."
According to his own information, Laschet also referred to the cases of Germans in prison in Turkey.
He had expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Mr Erdogan then reiterated the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been moved to a building of the Federal Ministry of Defence ’ s readiness to fly at Cologne Airport in the short term.
It was originally intended to happen at Schloss Wahn – but the castle owners had rejected it from political conviction against Erdogan.
Following the discussion, Erdogan went on to open the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said: "The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their point of contact - not the Turkish President.
Lack of confidence in the us: North Korea calls for disarmament
While us President Trump is not tired of emphasizing the success of North Korea ’ s denuclearization negotiations, the East Asian regime is more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for Washington to meet.
North Korea ’ s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho accused the us government in the UN General Debate of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula with its continuing sanctions.
"The recent deadlock is because the us is building on coercive measures that are deadly to build confidence," Ri said in New York.
In these circumstances, disarmament was unthinkable for North Korea.
"Without any confidence in the us, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, there is no way that we can disarm ourselves," said the North Korean chief diplomat.
The fact that North Korea's penalties could "force its knees" is "a dream of people who do not know us."
To build confidence, however, his country had stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri emphasised.
However, there were no "appropriate reactions" from the us side, the minister criticised.
Because of North Korea ’ s nuclear and missile program, last year alone, the UN Security Council adopted three sanctions against the internationally isolated country.
Us President Donald Trump and his Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo have in recent days called on the United Nations to adhere strictly to the penalties.
At the same time, the us government is working towards rapprochement.
In June, Trump met North Korea ’ s leader Kim Jong Un for the first time.
After the first Singapore summit, the us President is seeking a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo will travel to Pyongyang once again to discuss the end of the North Korean nuclear programme.
The HoT serves: new kitchen with donations from the municipality
The fact that they were actually in a youth meeting did not help many visitors to HoT ’ s open door: white blankets and flower decorations on the tables and a large buffet were waiting for the guests after the Erntedank divine service.
The young people of the HoT had enchanted the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The establishment was funded by donations from the municipality, for which the young people wanted to thank with food.
The start of the new facility was not easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, recalls.
We had filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then, the first day after the summer break, the evil surprise came: a power failure had put the huge two-piece refrigerator out of service, the food was corrupt and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start again: although we have received a lot of support from friends and neighbours, children and young people wanted to do it alone," said Westbuer.
And so everyone packed.
The result could be seen, the guests were enthusiastic.
"There is no better way for chefs either," a visitor praised, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were allowed to serve quiches, liver cheese or cakes.
"It is really great what children and young people have put on their feet," said Rev. Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen was astonished by cartoons and other art pieces.
Jürgen Sator leaves the North Rhine-Westphalia board
Out of frustration for criticism from his own ranks, the head of the Essener Tafel, Jörg Sartor, has given up his post in the federation.
Sartor had become known nationwide because the Essener Tafel had introduced a stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned in July as vice-chair of the NRW boards, Sartor said to the "World on Sunday."
I have fallen too much in my back.
Wolfgang Weilerswist, head of the Tafeln-Landesverband NRW, expressed sympathy with DPA for the decision of its long-standing deputy.
Sartor took with him the sharp criticism.
"I can understand his move - people who didn't know exactly why the Essener Tafel was doing this have expressed themselves."
Sartor, however, was still active for the Essen table - "six days a week, nothing changes," said Weilerswist.
Sartor again criticized colleagues from other boards in the "World on Sunday."
We should not follow the approach that "without us, the people of the city are starving."
It was the task of the state to ensure that people did not starve.
The Essener did not attend a congress of tables on Friday in Berlin.
"There's too much sweetness to tell me," he said.
There are all these social fuzzis, which also criticized me in those days.

Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a completely happy debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbacher, who joined the Swiss Quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang, gave twice a lead, ultimately played 2: 2, and have been waiting for a victory away in the VW city since 2003.
Renato Steffen and his second Bundesligator were responsible for Wolfsburg ’ s 1: 1 compensation.
Yann Sommer was powerless in 20 metres of Aargau's flat shot, as was the second counter hit after an hour.

After half an hour, Hanno Behrens already put the home team on course through Foulpenalty.
Macedonians vote on new state names
In Macedonia, around 1.8 million citizens today vote on whether to change the name of their country in northern Macedonia.
With a yes, the nearly three decades-long conflict with Greece ’ s neighbour could be resolved.

Voters therefore also decide on future Western integration.
The us had announced that, with a positive outcome of the referendum, the country could quickly become a NATO member.

SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of marriage for everyone, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-standing friend Christoph Rohde.
They both agreed in Hamburg on Saturday.
A registered life partnership was not in question for them, Kahrs had previously said in the "Bild" newspaper.
"If we get married, then right," he has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the spokesman for budgetary policy of the SPD federal party and one of the spokespersons of the Seeheim district, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening up of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs raised a rage speech on 30 June 2017.
He had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stepped up" on the subject.
"This was your Schabowski moment," he said in reference to Günter Schabowski's accidental announcement of the opening of the GDR border.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to enter into their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as adoption law.
Garden day: 400 metres of hedges cut
There was a lot of work in front of the members of the Citizens' Association of Children's House and the Society for Lepraknowledge.
Around 400 metres of hedge around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfründnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the inhabitants, it went to work for around twelve supporters.
"We are doing this to reduce costs," said the chairman of the citizens' association, Walter Schröer.
And something like this has accumulated.
Because of the hot summer, we are late this time, but fortunately it is now only a shape.
Because already in the spring the hedge was shaved.
The breakfast always following the work has also been a long tradition.
"Everyone should remain strong, too," said Walter Schröer.
World Cup in Rio: Hannes Aigner picks up gold at the canoe lalom world championship
Hannes Aigner from Augsburg won the gold medal at the end of the Rio de Janeiro canoe lalom world championship.
The 29-year-old made a perfect run on Sunday at the Olympia track.
Two years ago, he missed the Olympic bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well prepared, had enough journeys here on the plant and it has done everything right today, "said the London Olympics Third in 2012.
With the goal, he threw his paddle away with joy and put both arms high in a secure position, knowing that it would be enough for at least one medal.
After all, he had a start number four.
But the six remaining starters could not top his fable time of 89.69 seconds.
The second was the Czech Jiri Prskavec in front of the Russian Pawel Eigel.

Hertha failure: catching up with reality: Bavaria challenges Ajax
The prediction is unbeatable: the defeat in Berlin wants FC Bayern "not to please."
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim period for Niko Kovac ’ s term of office.
The first small model under the new Coach Niko Kovac is not expected to increase to the greater autumn depth for the Munich people.
"One week ago, there was the impression that we were invincible.
Now we have a little bit of reality, "said Thomas Müller after the earned 0-2 defeat at Hertha BSC, demanding a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us knows that this is annoying and that is why we are giving gas to Tuesday.
For the first time since more than a year, no gate has been shot away, as at the same time of the preseason two mandatory games in series without victory, the table leadership in the football federal league has for the time being lost to Borussia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation is no longer as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record champion must be warned.
The FC Augsburg at 1: 1 with its strong man-to-man tactics and the Berliners through their playful needle sticks above the outside delivered two blue breaks within three days, just as the most recently overpowering Bavaria can be cracked.
"Those who know FC Bayern know that we don't like this and we will do everything we can to make ourselves successful again," Kovac stressed.
Otherwise, however, he and his losers moved surprisingly gently in his birthplace, pushing his first defeat as a Munich coach merely towards the once again poor handling of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless make the first interim period of his term positive, otherwise the tone would probably worsen.
For example, prior to the second royalty performance this season after 2: 0 at Benfica Lisbon, Kovac did not undertake any exceptional measures.
After the opening day on Sunday, the brief preparation for the second round against Ajax, which also sovereignly imposed Athens at 3: 0, will begin as planned.
"Now it has caught us in two games, but we will also make our gates again," announced national team captain Manuel Neuer.
As in the aftermath of the lost Cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt, Joshua Kimmich spoke in particular in plain language.
The defendant appeared as a reminder.
"I don't think it's all bad, we need to re-establish it, because we don't make the many opportunities and make the mistakes behind us," stressed the 23-year-old shortly before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, Bavaria was already behind Dortmund with five counters, which has now taken the lead with one point of advance.
And so Kimmich, with an eye wink, appreciated at least positively that the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has now come to an end.
"Yes, that's a good thing," said the national player.
It is good for the league.
DFB-Boss in Schusslinie: Özil-Causa: Erdogan's sharp attack on Grindel
With serious allegations, Turkish President Erdogan denounces the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the association line.
A new post is now being created.
Berlin – Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought on different stages for interpretation on the permanent issue of Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish President criticized vigorously the handling of the ex-World champion in Germany at the opening of the big Ditib Mosque in Cologne, the DFB leader defended the association line.
Early on Sunday morning, Özil ’ s personally heavily attacked Grindel announced the consequences of the Causa at the ZDF Sportstudio in Mainz.
"In the future, because we also have many migrant players in the U teams, we must draw very precise conclusions that something like this does not happen again," said the 57-year-old and wants a national player without win background as further integration representatives.
At the same time, Grindel reiterated that Erdogan did not represent the values of football and the DFB.
He strongly denounced racism towards Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our Mesut Özil and Ilkay, born and raised in Germany.
They excluded them from this society because they could be photographed with me in England ," Erdogan said on Saturday in the cathedral town.
To be honest, as her president, I could not have died that our two young men, who went up to the German national team, were excluded.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that, unlike Özil, he felt "reasonably treated by the DFB" after the World Cup affair, which started with Erdogan's photographs.
At the same time, he announced that he would like to face players in the future.
That someone says: if I win, I am a German, if I lose, I am a migrant - that is not possible.
"I very much regret that he has such an impression," Grindel said.
We should have defended Mesut more, as I have always said.
But he does not see the basis for Özil ’ s return to the national team.
As a result, an additional integration representative will now be appointed alongside the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who have family roots in Cameroon.
"When a person without a migrant background clearly contributes to society and football and says:" This issue is important, we need to take care ," this would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs, where integration must work," said Grindel.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, he intends to re-establish his position as DFB president next year.
"I am doing my job and I am trying to do it as well as I can," Grindel said.
Younger builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg / Rödental - As reported by the police, the 75-year-old caused accidents on Friday between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.
First, the 75-year-old driver was addressed by a lady at the red traffic light in the Lauterer Höhe range.
She informed the pensioner that he had driven against her car.
However, there was no exchange of personnel, as the 75-year-old could no longer find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, the police received a telephone message about a driver who would have left the street and driven against a guide post.
Mentioned, the man did not want police on the ground and then drove away.
The Rödentaler then moved home.
However, the pensioner has been driving in his residence, where he has been living for decades, and has fallen by a construction vehicle when turning.
After all, the police could find and stop him.
His car suffered significant accident damage.
The 75-year-old made a whirling impression and could no longer remember much.
The damage amounts to approximately €1300.
Moorbrand in Meppen: still nearly 1,000 deployed.
Around four weeks after the outbreak of the Moorbrands at a German military site in Emsland, 980 workers are still engaged in the extinguishing operations.
The Bundeswehr announced this on Sunday.
As the situation continued to develop steadily, according to a speaker, 70 volunteers were recently withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of deployed persons is planned, it says.
During the night of Sunday, an above-ground fire had been discovered and destroyed.
Last week, the disaster was lifted, proclaimed just a week earlier on 21 September, because it was feared that the flames would threaten adjacent forests and settlements by wind and spark flight.
Thursday it was then said that there was no threat of a branding of neighbouring municipalities.
At times, more than 1500 operatives on the ground attempted to control the fire.
The Luftwaffe continues to support work at the Bundeswehr Test Station near Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also educational flights with drones from the Bundeswehr.
According to the Bundeswehr, reconnaissance flights with "Tornados" are also scheduled for 2 and 5 October.
The fire was triggered by test missiles fired by Airbus technicians.
The smoke flag of the Moorbrand was temporarily pulled up to a hundred kilometres across the north-west of Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr intends to establish a contact point to receive damage claims.
First claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.

Referendum on new state names begun in Macedonia
In Macedonia, the eagerly anticipated referendum on a new name for this small Balkan country has begun.
Some 1.8 million voters will decide whether their state should be called Northern Macedonia in the future.
Because of its northern province of the same name, Greece insists on this.
As a means of pressure, Athens had blocked every move from Skopje to the EU and NATO for almost three decades.
If citizens vote yes, they will also give the start to their country's Western integration.

Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register aims to facilitate organ donation and to relieve relatives in stress situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may continue to be removed only with explicit consent, stresses Swisstransplant.
 (Dpa) Switzerland will launch an electronic register of organ donors this Monday.
This should facilitate organ donation and relieve family members in stress situations.
People who wish to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes can then be obtained from Swisstransplant if necessary.
Swisstransplant stresses that the new procedure does not change the fact that organs may continue to be removed only with explicit consent, as in Germany.
It is estimated that 15% of the Swiss have a donation card, says Franz Immer, Director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only five percent of the cases would find a card at the crucial moment with potential donors.
In more than 60% of the calls, the relatives do not know the desire of the deceased.
"They will then have to take a decision in the spirit of the deceased, which is often very burdensome," says Always.
A similar registration system existed already in Great Britain.
Germany is considering storing information on the possible donation of organs on the health insurance card, as Marita Völker-Albert, the spokeswoman of the Federal Agency for Health Education, says.
"There is no register where people can register their wishes, either per or counter organ donation," she says.
The Federal Minister for Health, Jens Spahn, has voted in favour of a new regime for organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would initially be considered organ donor unless he or she objects.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is world champion in headphones
Japan ’ s 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda is a world champion in headphones.
He fought against 39 fellow members at the weekend in Wolfsburg.
This was announced by Martina Flamme-Jasper from the Phaeno Science Museum, the venue of the competition, on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel greeting from Germany took third place.
The youngest participant in the World Cup was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, the oldest one 74-year-old French pensioner, as chief adjudicator Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organises the competition every two years.
Previous tasks were, for example, 14.130 214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
Since viewers were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon where participants came up against guests from the audience using a pocket calculator.
Wenzel's greeting from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air when calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for competition.
Two years ago, a 14-year-old was present in Bielefeld.
Concepts like superbrain, genius or wonder child can hardly begin with organizers laughing.
"Headcount can be trained," he said.
Many participants practised several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even staged computing contests.
Disciplines include, for example, square root pulling from six digits.
In calculating versatility, candidates are given surprise tasks for which they need to quickly find a solution.
The Germans would also have good opportunities here, said the chief arbitrator.
Otherwise, Asians would often be in the advantage of learning more intensively and effectively in early childhood calculations.
Strong appeal: video of naked Serena Williams: early detection of breast cancer
Tennis Ass Serena Williams shows her sensitive and sensitive side.
The 37-year-old wants to use this video to highlight breast cancer and make himself strong for early detection.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and awareness.
Serena Williams sings without the song "I Touch Myself" by the group "The Divinyls" - only her hands hide their most intimate places.
The singer Chrissy Amphlett died of it.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project, which is about early detection of breast cancer that can save lives.
Serena Williams herself died almost a year ago.
There were complications when her daughter Alexis Olympia was born.
An emergency operation was launched to save the baby ’ s life.
A subsequent CT revealed blood clots in Serena ’ s lungs.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna – The Federal Government plans a significant extension of the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the Turkish-Blue Coalition will consider a draft law on the so-called "Symbols Act."
This aims to significantly increase the number of terrorist or similar groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings fresh snow on the mountains in the west
Mrs Holle shakes her beds for the first time next week in the West: polar cold air reaches Vorarlberg, Nordtirol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit falls to 1,500 to 1,200 metres at the beginning of the week - in narrow valleys it could snow at a strong intensity of up to about 1,000 metres, it was said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern, 20 to 40 centimetres of fresh snow could be expected above 2,000 metres.
Higher pass roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) therefore become winterly.
Farmers are allowed to start on Monday with the annual crack care
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers are allowed to start on Monday with annual crack care.
Germany's unique "green walls" have shaped the landscape of the forest-based federal state for some 200 years.
The up to five metres wide are "forest replacements" and for many animals and plants the last areas of retreat.
Knicks connect habitats scattered as corridors, which can still be used for the exchange of organisms, as said Ingo Ludwichowski, Managing Director of the German Nature Conservation Association (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein.
Cracks are living fences
The Knicks were created on the basis of an order issued by the Danish King Christian VI in 1766, who reigned over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field restrictions and livestock fences; they also supplied the farmers with firewood and beams for their farmhouses.
It was also known as "Knick" at that time: by "cracking" the branches were able to develop the dense, intertwined boundaries.
Today, approximately 45 000 kilometres of hedges stretch between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, giving the impression of an oil-rich, diversely structured landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used by some 7000 species as replacement living spaces.
Up to 1800 different species could live in one kilometre and breed up to 30 pairs of birds.
However, its ecologically important function can only be fulfilled if it is properly maintained in winter.
Otherwise, Ludwichowski said that it is a light series of trees which, in addition to biodiversity, also loses the wind protection effect.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, crackling treatment may only be operated outside the gross period from October to March.
Following the tsunami in Sulawesi Indonesia talking about situation on the ground
In an interview with the German Redaktion Network (Rnd), Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi following the earthquakes and the tsunami:
Were you on site yourself during the tsunami?
No, I was just in Jakarta on the island of Java.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me that she was in Palu.
When I learned of the tsunami, I immediately returned to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, because the airport was closed at Palu at the time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, which are all completely destroyed.
Our "World Vision" office is also destroyed, but we have temporarily set up something where we have housed other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many have come to surrounding hills, where they still remain afraid of another tsunami and earthquake, and where they have no access to water and food.
Some stay in front of their homes, and there are still quakes.
Because many grocery stores, including gas stations, are completely closed, people sometimes claw food and petrol.
The public service has completely shut down, and the national government is helping out.
A prison has also been destroyed, prisoners run partly freely around and finding them is difficult.
There are still many corpses around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How is communication and information supply on the island?
At the moment we have mobile phones, but it didn't work before, and we only received information via radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors, and others whom they don ’ t know whether they live or where they live, because people didn ’ t go home during the earthquakes, but, for example, work.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have information on this?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many thought "Okay, no tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was misinformation that a tsunami hit the region and they ran to the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi on the Pacific Fire Ring not prepared for earthquakes?
But there are earthquakes every day, but that was the worst.
We normally know how we react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, and the earthquake has hit many people.
Muscle injuries against Werder: VfB must renounce Aogo and Donis for a long time
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will be missing the VfB Stuttgart with severe muscle injuries for a long time.
On Saturday, at 2: 1 against Werder Bremen, Aogo took a muscle fiber crack in the rear left thigh, the federal football league announced on Sunday.
At Donis, doctors diagnosed muscle bundles in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hanover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss games after the next national break.
VfB Stuttgart failed to provide a forecast for the downtime.
A muscle bundle crack usually heals within six to eight weeks, and a muscle fiber crack usually heals slightly faster.
Hyperrealism Triumph at the San Sebástian Film Festival
San Sebastián - The San Sebastián Film Festival closes every year the tournaments of the most prestigious European festivals.
Despite all the songs on the cinema, 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.
After a convincing competition in Cannes, particularly with strong contributions from Europe and Asia and a Venice, which could draw much attention with Hollywood Oscar candidates, San Sebastian has also delivered one of his best competitions in recent years.
On Sunday morning the fire brigade Olching tried to capture a wounded duck.
The action, however, took some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - Walkers at Lake Olchinger found a white, injured duck on Sunday morning.
It was located in the water station.
Passersby called the police and the fire brigade to help the animal.
However, the first attempts to capture the duck went wrong.
Despite the injury, it has been able to evade the forces again and again.
In the end, she fled to the sea.
With a lifeboat, the fire brigade was able to encircle the animal and push it back to the ground, where it was then placed in a transport box after almost an hour by a firefighter with a heartfelt handle.
The duck injured by the breast was then taken to the LMU veterinary clinic in Oberschleißheim.
But, according to the first estimates, their chances of survival are rather low.
Biathlet Julian Eberhard presents World Cup Medal
Fourth place at Olympia was Biathlet Julian Eberhard long in his stomach.
Next winter, the Saalfeldener plans to catch up with the missed precious metal at the World Cup in Östersund.
The last shot was borne by the 31-year-old in Pyeongchang ’ s Olympia-Sprint, which was close to grabbing the coin.
Seven tenths of a second lacked bronze at the end.
"I have deliberately given myself time to process this," says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym Fitnessstudio in his hometown of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top shape, but it simply didn ’ t want to be.
The Pinzgauer is all the more motivated to catch up with the missing precious metal in the new season: "The aim can only be to regain a major event with the Constitution.
At some point, you have to beat it.
The World Cup track in Östersund (SWE) is Eberhard: "I've already closed the track in my heart," he remembers with pleasure his fourth World Cup in the individual race last year.
Immediately after Olympia, he celebrated in Kontiolahti's mass launch competition (fin) the only single win for Austria last winter.
With the season he ran second in Oslo (nor).
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI inquiry at turbo speed
Time is extremely short and the number of planned interrogations is very limited.
With a turbo-speed FBI investigation, Republicans in the us Senate want to secure the thin majority for Brett Kavanaugh, the judge ’ s candidate disputed for charges.
President Donald Trump has set the investigators a deadline of Friday to clarify the alleged incidents over the past 30 years.
The recent turn in the drama of Kavanaugh ’ s vocation accompanied by a cultural struggle was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing held by Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor, Christine Blasey Ford, during which the lawyer expelled angry tirades against the opposition democrats, the Senate ’ s Justice Committee should pave the way for the final confirmation of the old-conservative judge at the us Supreme Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed secure when Senator Jeff Flake suddenly declared, contrary to his original announcement, that he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
According to tumult scenes, his party friends approved.
President Trump, who had called the heavy talk of Thursday's "decision," initially abstained from further attacks against women and, on the contrary, spoke of "happiness in misfortune."
This would remove the final doubts, he said.
Later Trump attacked the Democrats sharply in a poll because they rejected Kavanaugh: "They try to block and destroy."
Trump ordered FBI investigation in the Kavanaugh case
The White House has also extremely limited the powers of investigators.
A government representative told the Wall Street Journal: "They don't go on a fishing trip."
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
According to the municipality, the mobile radar device of the municipality of Ried, which is installed in a "civil vehicle," will be stationed on the garden road from Monday 1 October.
The Federal School Centre is also located there.
The municipality also operates several fixed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: fear has been felt
Coaches Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first season victory against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is large after the first season victory.
However, the time factor also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen – Meanwhile it is well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist in football matches.
This was no different in the home match against Mainz 05.
"I've seen every ball in it.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penalty room, "said Schalke 04's Sports Board, breathing up.
After all, the royal blue had succeeded in bringing the scarce 1-0 against the Rhine Hesses over time, and thus the first seasonal victory under control.
Indeed, it could have been different.
After Alessandro Schöpf ’ s 11th leadership gave the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco a certainty: “In sum, the first half was good, both playful and pressing ”. more and more of the head a role.
Creature doesn't actually have a headball monster
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours for me," Heidel said: "If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands, so they kept on withdrawing.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three counters of the season.
"We all fell a huge stone from our hearts," said Schöpf, who had nothing to do with his headball hit: "I am actually the worst headball player in the team."
But in the end, only victory counts.
The relief was noticeable throughout the arena, including Tedesco, of course.
"We wanted to start in the early stages and make a fireworks out of it," said Schalkes Chief Coach.
Victory was important.
We can finally be happy for a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We have played intelligently, calmly and courageously, so we have to tackle games over 90 minutes
Probably the biggest lack of the afternoon: royal blue failed to worry about clearer circumstances.
The possibilities for this were, for example, through the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, which hit the latte twice 59 / 72 or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it would not have been a tremendous victory," Tedesco said: "The fear has already been felt a bit."
That is why I am glad that we have won.
He was not the only scarecrow.
Fishbachau: smoking column in the Leitzachtal 2 km visible

Around two kilometres away, a hiker observed a fire in the Leitzachtal on Sunday at around 1.30 p.m.
The police are now investigating.
Fish bachau - The cause was soon found out by the police and fire brigade: an unknown had lit garbage on a two-square-metre surface at the Gschwendner Berg.

And that near the forest.
30 firefighters were engaged in dismantling and deleting fish farmers.

Prof. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: a discussion at eye level
Before them is the author, Professor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has repeatedly responded to the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"For many years now, I have had the task of bringing interesting people to Greven," says the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treffen" - the association that is organising the evening with the alliance "cultural policy." "cooperated.
El-Mafaalani is getting into reading very easily, describing the book's writing process, talking about how difficult it was to explain the subject understandably.
With a lot of gesture, hand-held figures, and one joke or another, it brings the audience closer to one of the most conflict-ridden issues: migration and integration.
Why are conflicts increasing despite successful integration?
The author of the Syrian regime is helping to answer the question of a metaphor.
The German society is at the table, the first-generation migrants at the cat table.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to go to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to join in.
This leads to conflicts.
So it is not crucial whether you are politically right or left, but "Am I in favour or against an open society?" he emphasises.
Rather behave in the beginning, then the round of discussions is increasingly moving.
And there is a need for speech.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers telling how they see successful or unsuccessful integration with pupils.
El-Mafaalani is a symbol of the debate, not on stage: it is at eye level.
The sociology professor does not express his opinion, emphasising that he speaks of the average, not of individual fates.
He is pleased that there is interest in the subject, because "only when we understand what the problem is can we find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
During the subsequent signing hour, he also had an open hearing on the questions of the guests and was also discussed in the foyer, in preparation of Kurdish specialities.

Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The demand appears to be huge: more than 100 interested parties have applied for the purchase of one of the plots in Landsham South.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first plots of land in the new Landsham-South area on the free market.
Mayor Roland Frick announced this.
In addition, the application phase for the 20 plots offered by the municipality at more favourable conditions and prices is completed, similar to the previous local model.
Some 100 applications were received, Frick said.
"The documents are currently being examined" in terms of application criteria, completeness and accuracy.
According to the Mayor of Plieningen, the objective was to have drawn up the candidate list for the 20 plots by the end of the year and to submit them to the municipal council.
The contract could then be awarded.
A total of 50 plots of land for single and double houses are created in the area in the south of Landsham, and four areas for multi-family houses with eight housing units each.

Schalkes Naldo succeeds in "great sport" on the bank
For the third time in a row, Naldo is grateful to Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen – After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues was sitting for the third time in a row not in the Schalker Startelf but on the exchange bench, many people would have understood that the nearly two-metre-sized Brazilian would have been so frustrated. he would have talked about the soul.
But when the Schalker players gathered in the middle circle after the 1-0 victory over FSV Mainz 05 and thanked head coach Domenico Tedesco for all his professionals, the 36-year-old, who everyone calls Naldo, turned on, and said, "We have to thank you, trainers!"
"That was very emotional, that was great sport," Tedesco later commented on the reaction of his Vice-Captain, who, despite his re-reservist-dasein, was no big deal.
Probably, Naldo, who was celebrated last season as the best scarecrow, knows that his coach doesn't really get on the stall - he's getting a break for good reasons.
A reason called "load control."
It was not easy to tell him
"It wasn't easy to tell him, I tell you very honestly," Tedesco reported from the moment he told Naldo that he wasn't in the Starfleet.
He is an important player, he is an important person.
But it's always about the matter, it's about the club ," Tedesco founded the move.
Naldo played 90 minutes against Bavaria and Porto.
He is 36 years old.
It is important that everyone is able to take a break at the moment.
And that we all keep in the boat, "Tedesco explained the rotation that Naldo recently caught.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by proving himself an exemplary team player in the bank.
The Austrian industry ’ s mood continued to accelerate its downturn compared to the eurozone in August.
The shopping manager index (PMI) was 46.7 points at a 37-month level.
However, throughout Europe, Austria has the third best atmosphere behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute announced on Monday its survey of more than 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the euro area PMI increased by 1.1 points to 45.1 points, but the index is nonetheless the 13th consecutive month below the 50-counter mark indicating growth.
Only Ireland's industry cut this threshold by 50.9 points in August.
The Greeks were at the end (42.1 points).
In Germany, France, and Spain, the mood barometer dropped, but slower than in previous months.
In Spain, the index reached its highest level since March, with 44.0 points.
"The slightly weakened descent may mean that the worst has survived," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
But industry remains the number one growth brake in the third quarter.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the eurozone fell as strong as since November 2011.
The companies therefore deployed posts for the seventh consecutive month.
In China, too, industrial production fell stronger in August than initially assumed.
The mood barometer fell from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The shopping manager index is based on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
These include developments in sales, employment, storage and prices.
