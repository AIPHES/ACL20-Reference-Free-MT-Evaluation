Yes, she wants...
Be a "beautiful Munich woman" in 2018!
In the afternoon, another surprise awaits our candidates: they will not do the romantic candlelight shoot in front of the MY SOLARIS alone, but at the side of male model Fabian!
Hvar - flirting, flirting, seducing - no easy tasks for our girls.
Especially when a friend is waiting in Germany.
Nevertheless, the nine "Schöne Münchnerin" candidates deliver during the shoot with People photographer Tuan and defy wind, spray and rain like real professionals.
The romantic shooting can be seen in the video:
DFB chief Grindel sees no basis for Özil comeback
Berlin DFB president Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for Mesut Özil's return to the national team.
"This is a question that of course depends on the fact that you get into a conversation, that you also talk to him about why he obviously felt one way or the other, as stated in his statement," Grindel said in the football podcast "Phrasenmower" of the "Bild-Zeitung.
Despite months of debate over Özil's photos with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he said he regretted the resignation of the 92-time international Özil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed up to a point that this would be the case, "Grindel said.
The 29-year-old had announced his retirement from the DFB team in July, citing the fact that Grindel had not defended him against racist hostility during the World Cup.
The DFB chief repeated his criticism of Özil for not being ready for a conversation with national coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He said he didn't want to build pressure, but he knows from football that when "you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I think it's a shame that that conversation hasn't come to fruition."
Linz: Garden Hut on Fire in Allotment Settlement
At 2: 13 p.m., the Linz Fire Department was alerted to a fire in Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage power line leads directly over the allotment, danger was in arrears.
The professional fire brigade moved out and found the hut on fire when they arrived.
The roof had to be removed practically in its entirety and fire debris had to be cleared to the extent absolutely necessary.
According to the owner of the burning garden shed, he had plugged in a battery for charging at lunchtime.
This could possibly be the cause of the fire.
In any case, according to the fire department, the charger was in the area of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire has yet to be determined, as has the cause of the fire.
However, it is likely to be considerable, as the owner had many collectibles in his garden shed.
Angry mother fights back: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on the street
What was it that drove Lindsay Lohan to this very strange action?
She apparently wanted to snatch the children from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan, 32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded" has herself live-streamed how she apparently wants to snatch the children from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal "TMZ" and a partial recording of the stream is published.
See "Luckily Kissed" with Lindsay Lohan
In the clip, Lohan is seen getting out of a car and walking to a possibly homeless family she claims to have identified as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family virtually flees the actress, Lohan pursues the parents and their children.
She accuses the adults of child trafficking.
She provides no evidence for any of this in the clip.
"The whole world is watching this," Lohan can be heard saying in the video as she continues to follow the family down the street.
Apparently she is trying to separate the children from their parents.
At some point, however, the obviously angry mother seems to have had enough.
It looks like she's turning around and giving Lohan a slap in the face.
In tears, the actress then professes how shocked she is - and she holds her cheek.
It is unclear at this time what prompted Lohan to take this action.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The "Hayabusa2" probe was launched in Japan in December 2014.
It is supposed to approach the asteroid Ryugu so close that it can suck in material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The "Mascot" lander will remain on Ryugu.
Foreign ticker: Death toll in Sulawesi rises to more than 400
At least 420 people have been reported dead following the powerful 7.5-magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The death toll could rise further, he said.
Rescue teams have not yet entered the devastated areas cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla chief executive
In the beginning was a tweet.
Tesla boss Elon Musk caused a stir in the stock markets in early August when he announced the electric car maker was pulling out.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission sued him for fraud, but the two have now reached an agreement.
Tesla and Musk will have to pay, and the Tesla chief executive will step down from the board, but he will be allowed to remain chief executive.
British Conservative Party Conference
Tightly guarded - the Tory party conference
Birmingham is becoming the stage for a power struggle.
The party conference is expected to focus on foreign policy, trade and development, but the four-day conference will be overshadowed by the row between Prime Minister Theresa May and Brexit hardliners, led by ex-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.
Referendum for a new state name
The foreign ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already reached an agreement
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing over these duplications of names for years.
Now they have agreed.
The state of Macedonia is to be called Northern Macedonia in the future, and the population will vote on it this Sunday - will it be all right?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populist Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The Not") - meaning Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before Brazil's presidential election, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands took to the streets in several cities to protest against right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" presents himself as an anti-system candidate and is thus ahead in the polls.
His closest rival is Fernando Haddad of the left-wing Workers' Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" refurbishment takes longer than planned
"The diesel task force still exists," Chief Development Officer Peter Mertens told the industry publication "Automobilwoche."
Audi CEO Rupert Stadler, who was arrested and placed on leave, announced in December 2017 that the task force would soon be disbanded.
"All engine / transmission combinations are expected to be tested in the first quarter of 2018," he said at the time.
Mertens said: "At the beginning of July, we reached an important milestone in dealing with the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The task force was set up in September 2015 following the discovery of the diesel scandal at Audi's parent company Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the carmaker had made "serious organisational changes" to ensure such a scandal would never happen again.
The VW supervisory board postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and plans to discuss it further on Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse the Audi boss of having allowed the sale of diesel cars with incorrect exhaust emission values after becoming aware of the emissions cheating.
In doing so, he allegedly knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
Currently, Chief Sales Officer Bram Schot heads the company as acting CEO.
Due to the changeover to the new exhaust and fuel consumption test standard WLTP, there are production losses at Audi, Schot told the "Heilbronner Stimme."
In principle, he sees a decreasing demand for saloons such as the A6, A7 and A8 audio models, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Schot focuses on electric mobility.
There have already been 15,000 reservations for the e-tron, the first Audi electric car.
Grindel seeks re-election - Lahm to join DFB executive committee
Mainz (AP) - Reinhard Grindel wants to run for president of the German Football Association (DFB) again next year, despite criticism of him following the World Cup exit and the Özil affair.
"I'm doing my job and trying to do it as well as I can," Grindel said as a guest on ZDF's "Current Sports Studio" early Sunday morning.
You have to keep trying to get re-elected, and I will do that.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
The FA chief executive said it would be 'strange' if he did not 'feel like working on the project for the future' following the bid for Euro 2024.
Grindel has been the head of the association since April 2016, succeeding Wolfgang Niersbach, who was ousted over the summer fairy tale affair.
In autumn 2016, he was elected for a first full three-year term.
The next vote is due at the DFB Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future head organiser of the European Championships, Philipp Lahm, is to work on the DFB executive committee.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau would agree that he should continue to advise in this role in the Bureau and then, of course, be cordially invited to make his experience available in sporting matters," Grindel said.
He did not want to take part in speculation as to whether Lahm could be his successor as DFB boss.
As a consequence of the affair over the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in the future an international without a migration background should become an integration ambassador of the DFB.
Currently, this position is held by Brazilian-born Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter with family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone without a migrant background has a clear impact on society and football and says," the issue is important, we have to take care of it, "that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground, where integration has to work," Grindel said.
Lose weight correctly with half-smart scales
I have had a new toy for four weeks.
A scale that measures not only my weight, but also the percentage of body fat.
It can also indicate muscle and bone mass.
The thing also calculates the body mass index, but this is more for the sausages.
It doesn't say anything about whether I've replaced fat with muscle.
Basketball Bundesliga: Clear kick-off successes for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin has started the new season of the basketball league with a clear victory.
Against Science City Jena, the runner-up easily won with 112: 55 (52: 31) and offered a convincing game over 40 minutes.
New signing Rokas Giedraitis was the top scorer for the dominant Berlin side with 20 points.
The international Johannes Thiemann (18 points), signed from Ludwigsburg, also showed an attractive performance in front of 9113 spectators on his mandatory debut.
Former champion Brose Bamberg won the mandatory match debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis with 84: 80 (39: 37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the best pitcher among the guests with 24 points.
Würzburg pro Gabriel Olaseni finished with 14 points.
Last year's playoff semi-finalist MHP Giants defeated the Frankfurt-based Fraport Skyliners 83-76 (41-34).
New international Karim Jallow was the most accurate shooter on coach John Patrick's team with 24 points.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a clear success.
At the Basketball Lions Braunschweig there was a clear 100: 64 (48: 30) and the first two points.
New playmaker Will Cummings was outstanding for the Oldenburg side with 25 points.
The Brunswick side, in which NBA star Dennis Schroeder has been the majority owner since the start of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26-1 run by the Baskets quickly made things clear.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met German Chancellor Angela Merkel and German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, among others, during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to extradite Gülen supporters living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens, no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to upset our citizens and harm German-Turkish friendship, "he said.
The city centre of Cologne was partially closed for the opening of the Ditib Mosque.
Several thousand police officers were deployed - including snipers.
The Islamic association Ditib is under criticism because it is seen as an extension of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music against poverty: Stars, boos and moments of horror
Musicians including Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have called for more engagement in the fight against poverty and disease at a joint concert in New York's Central Park.
"Get involved wherever you can," Mendes said at the festival on Sunday night in front of a crowd of about 60,000.
Thank you for coming here, this is a dream.
Cardi B performed in a red outfit with fringe and a gold microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors including Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid agencies, also took to the stage for the several-hour spectacle.
In between, however, there was a moment of terror, when many spectators mistook the sound of a falling metal barrier for shots, became frightened and tried to flee.
Briefly there was panic, people were running around in confusion.
Seven spectators were slightly injured in the incident, organiser Hugh Evans said.
However, New York police and musician Chris Martin then calmed people down from the stage.
"No one is trying to hurt anyone," Martin said.
You are all safe.
As every year, tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge on the Internet.
If you wanted to get one, you had to read and distribute texts, photos and videos about the global fight against poverty and disease on the Internet.
There were cheers and applause from the audience for the numerous musicians and actors - but boos for Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
He did, however, join fellow Democrat Chris Coons on stage to speak out for more equality between men and women.
But on Friday, Flake spoke out in favor of Brett Kavanaugh's nomination as a Supreme Court justice in the US Senate Judiciary Committee, alienating many women.
At least three women have made allegations of abuse, including attempted rape, against Kavanaugh, which he denies.
Flake called for an FBI investigation into the allegations after two women who say they themselves experienced sexual assault confronted him in an elevator on the way to the committee meeting.
"You're welcome to join me in an elevator any time," Flake told the crowd at the concert in New York.
Press freedom: Federal Government defends expulsion of journalist
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert has defended the expulsion of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the Chancellery, the Turkish journalist, who lives in Hamburg, had put on a T-shirt with the Turkish and German words "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone to the front row.
The T-shirt was not the problem, Seibert told Bild am Sonntag.
It was about disrupting the flow of the press conference.
The journalist's action had caused a great deal of unrest, which was unacceptable.
He said he had arranged for security guards to take the man out.
Seibert said that it is not permitted to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This applies regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, many journalists are in prison.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage activities or support or membership in banned parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership blames the movement for the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists face several decades in prison.
Foreign journalists are also not safe from the Turkish authorities: Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was only arrested at the beginning of September.
Most recently, the cases of the imprisoned journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel caused a stir.
They were released and were able to return to Germany, but the two are still being tried in Turkey.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him as fresh and handsome: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look twice: Yes, that really is Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and had a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht," produced by NDR, is known for cheerful conversations at the bar of the Hamburg harbour pub "Schellfischposten."
Presenter Ina Müller toasts with her guests some beer, some wine or even high-percentage drinks in order to loosen up the mood and tongues.
Quite a few celebrities also drink themselves into the ground for the obligatory singing sessions.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was taped.
This time around: The actor Florian David Fitz is known from films such as "Men's Hearts," "Terror - Your Judgment" and "The Horniest Day."
But the trip to the far north did not go well for the Munich native.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face completely crumpled on it, his eyes just two small slits.
The bed selfie shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he just has a powerful hangover.
Addressing his fans, he posted some - probably not entirely serious - insights he has now gained: 'Rule one: NEVER go to Ina's night.
Rule two: never drink the black sow.
And spritz.
And leave out the round of eggnog, which Ina throws at half past three.
Alcohol consumption is written all over the 43-year-old's face.
His fans immediately posted a few tips on how to combat the aftermath.
They ranged from instant broth, fish rolls or - probably most purposefully - headache tablets.
Others were simply amused by the sight of the normally attractive movie star.
It is not yet known how Ina Müller survived the night-time binge.
However, since she has been hosting the TV fun at the bar since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more experienced...
For a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to deal with vandalism and debris
The entrance to the 36-kilometre-long railway cycle path in Red Riding Hood Land in Treysa is difficult to find and littered.
Recipes against rampant vandalism are sought, but solutions are few and far between.
Shards, cigarette butts, garbage and debris, demolished bins and meanwhile dismantled signs - this is how the entrance with seating group to the bike path on the Haaße hill in Treysa has been presented for a long time.
For the showpiece railway cycle path in the Red Riding Hood country a more than inglorious sight.
The topic has been occupying members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also others for some time, according to Ulrich Wüstenhagen, the city's cycling commissioner.
The issue had already been raised in the Cycling Advisory Board.
So far, there is no solution.
The proposals ranged from the relocation of the seating group to the regular emptying of the waste bins and cleaning of the areas at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the order of the day - regardless of possible further activities," Wüstenhagen says.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that he has also brought the topic to the local advisory board.
It's not just the rubbish that drives cyclists and residents around - the seating area is a regular meeting place for partying at weekends.
Not only is it often loud, the banquets also destroy: posts are torn out of the ground, rubbish bins are demolished, signs are bent over, seating furniture is smeared.
Volunteers have already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions are only the proverbial drop in the ocean.
They are annoyed that the rest area on the bike path in Treysa is a meeting point for binge drinking.
"Along the entire cycle path, the focus is clearly on the Haaße hill," confirms the cycling commissioner, who is now also concerned about the new cycling centre in Ziegenhain, which will be opened today.
'If she suffers the same fate, it's going to be really expensive. '
Another idea, he said, is video surveillance on the hill: "Maybe that sets the threshold much higher for seizing public property.
This would, however, require a police patrol to pass by in a timely manner.
In principle, Wüstenhagen wishes to see the development of the Haaße Hill.
It needs to be made more attractive.
One can be very satisfied with the frequency of the cycle path so far.
The tourism marketing is still expandable.
Our bike path is of a very high quality compared to others in Germany, "says the ADFC members.
ADFC member Susanne Klippert considers the situation in the Ascheröder Strasse in Treysa to be an extremely critical danger point.
There is no turning track on the Haaße hill.
In heavy traffic it can happen that cyclists have to wait in the middle of the road between traffic on both sides, "she explains.
This is not a problem for sporty drivers, but probably for older people and especially for children.
Music contest at the Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call for the music contest was a success, creatively and in cooperation.
"D is a song for Hiltrup," is the appeal of the district offensive Hiltrup, in the "music contest for big and small, young and experienced musicians."
A contest "with a wink in the sympathetic Hiltruper family," as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family get-together with coffee and cake from the volunteers of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven groups competed, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, an Albachtener who lived for a long time in Hiltrup, the nine from the "Hiltruper Sternfarben," three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
This contest, declared district mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We haven't seen that in other parts of the city.
What did the copywriters see themselves associated with?
With the places the Hiltruper lake and the Marktallee were mentioned particularly frequently.
Rolf Ihmig named the avenue "Kö von Hiltrup" in his hit-like song.
The Kulturbahnhof was also honoured.
Again and again, it was about experiencing togetherness in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke animated the short breaks with short interviews with the performers or hints about their work.
So it was learned from Humberg that he had actually studied chemistry, but now also teaches guitar.
Franke reported from the sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann that he had recently performed in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest in the programme.
And Alvin Jasic, meanwhile, has put all sorts of things on YouTube.
"It's not about winning," Franke had said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper catering trade.
Still, there was something special for the judges "favorites - so that others could hear their songs, too.
An entire CD can be recorded by Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup hit, which particularly impressed Franke with its musicality, and the "Lummerland pack": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two kindergarten teachers on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone else, the children performed again for the finale - and even without electronic support, they sounded "really good," as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, catchiness of the melody and recognition value.
The jury consisted of Gisbert Keller from the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Wirtschaftsverbund, as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive had brought the event to life on the occasion of its ten-year anniversary.
She rated the event as a complete success.
Everyone was "very satisfied," and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon-to-be very crowded Kulturbahnhof.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other.
For each page there is a screen, in it four cards with keywords, which - the old trick with the red foil - can only be deciphered once you have put them in.
This ensures that the other side cannot read anything, even by mistake.
The cards then read, for example, from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2nd window.
3rd cube.
4. Fest. "
These are the terms that need to be encrypted from now on.
For it is not the terms that are to be guessed here, but codes.
Alternately, one player per team is the encrypter.
He gets a code card that perhaps says "3.4.2."
What is to be guessed in "Decrypto" is not the terms behind the secret foil, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: He should - in this order and in this example - describe the terms "dice," "fixed" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team, if possible, does not; because that wins the game if he manages to crack the code twice.
The encrypter thus notes down and reads aloud: "Throw" for the dice, "Lose" as opposed to Fest; here, of course, something like "Party" would also be possible and "Prague" because he paid attention at school and knows the lintel there.
So it goes on round by round, team by team.
You don't know the terms of the other side - but you can rhyme them better with every hint the encrypter gives there.
So the paraphrases should be as mysterious as possible, but not too crazy, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptic thing about "Decrypto" is the rule book.
The players probably have to study it quite a long time and in detail until they can finally play.
The explanation video at decrypto.info on the net makes it easier.
But once you get started, it will be fascinating to see how much emotion there is in this unassuming game.
All in all, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as predecessor and genre prime "Codenames," which also applies an agent theme to a game of fewer words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And if you're only interested in guessing and not winning points, you can easily come up with a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler salute and harasses guests in pub
A 48-year-old man employed the Kulmbach police department twice during the night from Saturday to Sunday.
First he showed the Hitler salute to a passing police patrol in the Upper City, later he also caught the eye in a pub in the Upper City when he harassed other guests.
After he was clearly drunk and did not comply with the court order issued by the police, he had to spend the night in the detention cell at the Kulmbach police inspectorate.
In a sober state, he must then also be criminally responsible for the use of signs of unconstitutional organizations.
Pressig depot was the home of the push-pull engines
For decades, the railway depot in Pressig was the hub in the Franconian Forest.
A piece of railway history ended in 1991.
"When buffers popped against buffers, you could hear it all over Pressig," recalls Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the railway station.
No one was upset by that.
Then the brakes squealed and the wagons rattled.
That was just pure railway.
Statements that are emblematic of Dinkel's homeland Pressig.
Nowhere in the Franconian Forest has a place been so shaped by the railway.
This was the starting point of the steep ramp mountain route to the north, which has its apex in Steinbach am Wald after an ascent of about 220 metres in altitude.
In order to cope with this, train and drawer locomotives used to be needed, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian state parliament approved the construction of a railway workshop with 21 locomotive sheds, apprentice workshop, catenary and railway maintenance.
"The centrepiece was the turntable, which, after a conversion in 1899, had a diameter of 18 metres," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, a railway historian and professional railway worker for 47 years.
The railway depot (BW) Pressig, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, also operated locomotives for the branch lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On 15 July 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160; 13 steam and eight electric locomotives were stationed in Pressig at that time.
The electrification of the line in 1939 already minimised the need for train and push locomotives.
From 1977, they were only used for freight trains.
Until 1991, at least 10 000 wagons were still manoeuvred per month.
Parts of the plant were demolished in 1982 and the rest in 1991.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that a better use of the site has not been envisaged, including in terms of freight transport."
On Whitsun 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated the anniversary of "50 years of electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld" with a pompous station party in Pressig.
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," remembers Georg Dinkel.
A short time later, the end.
On 1 June 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, the Pressig marshalling yard was history.
"The shunting and shoe-laying workers did the most difficult work in train traffic," Dinkel recalls.
Any misstep would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station Pressig-Rothenkirchen led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many other historical and current pictures can be found here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with opening win at China Open
BEIJING (AP) - Wimbledon champion Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round of the tennis tournament in Beijing, just as Julia Görges did before.
Kerber won 6-2, 6-2 against France's Kristina Mladenovic at the China Open.
The next opponent in the world rankings is either Yulia Putintseva of Kazakhstan or Carla Suárez Navarro of Spain.
Siegemund led 6-3, 4-2 against Darya Kassatkina when the 13th-seeded Russian gave up.
The sister-in-law now faces Anett Kontaveit of Estonia.
As part of the series "Art and Pleasure," a special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach at the weekend.
It was with great relief that organisers and visitors registered the ideal weather when the special vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the open-air area of the estate Dahlmann-Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the umbrella of the tourist association "Rund ums Walberla" as part of the series "Kunst und Genuss."
It opened its doors in the 15th year.
A large number of visitors showed the fascination of the exhibition.
Twenty-one copies by 20 artists are now on display in Mittelehrenbach.
The host Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the vernissage.
He himself has been there since the first hour.
As did Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as both the main organizer and the artist.
Somewhat surprisingly, however, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he placed his task in proven, young hands with good prospects for the future.
Both have been actively involved in the selection of artists in the past and have helped to design flyers.
This year, on the occasion of Kunst & Genuss, there will once again be a 70-cent special stamp designed by them, available at every art station.
This year's poster "Betzn auPunching," designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased there for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased with the high popularity of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg could be won over for the musical accompaniment.
Walking through the spacious garden, it quickly becomes clear to the visitor that the title "Wind Chime Performance" literally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it playfully.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramic, often with colour accents.
Already at the entrance of the estate, the "lucky tree" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau, awaits the visitor on the right side.
It is a tree stump, brightened up in colour, playfully provided with 20 wind turbines, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminium tubes as a sound piece.
With the sun flashing through the bushes in the background, the object looks magically pensive and invites you to linger.
From Eckental comes Barbara Waschneck, who prefers to dedicate herself to the event 15 years K & G in three-dimensional letters.
There are many parts, in motion in the wind.
Half way through, Siegrid Frey from Eckental has exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child."
And at the end of the area Volker Hahn shows his colourful fantasy structure made of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Wind Chime Performance" invites you to stroll through the multi-faceted art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited until 31 December 2018.
50 years of MGV 68 albums: Singers celebrate 50th birthday
1968 - that was the time of protest and the student movement.
And the Albachians also expressed their displeasure at the time.
At least five of them.
They did not want to resign themselves to the fact that, after the dissolution of the church choir "Cecilia," there would no longer be a singing life in the district.
It has now become a legend: at a bank in the Tinnenbush they launched the MGV 68 nightmares.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in a big way in the "House of Encounter."
"It will be full today," anticipated chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he should be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albachten singers.
Especially for the anniversary, they had revived the foundation festival.
For years it was a tradition, then there was a break.
Just in time for the 50th anniversary, the traditional festival was back.
An elegant ball it became, festive attire had previously been asked for.
The guests did not sit in rows of seats as usual in the "House of Encounter," but sat comfortably at tables.
In between, movement was the order of the day: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln put on the controls and asked to take to the dance floor.
It was a matter of honour that the singers of the MGV 68 albums let the voice ring out themselves.
In keeping with the occasion, cheerful songs were announced.
Almost set: "Such a day, as beautiful as today."
To match the exquisite grape juice that many had in front of them, there was the "Rüdesheim wine."
In reference to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus," which is the Latin name for "hops," was heard.
The choral direction of Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were in the Tinnenbusch at the time, was once again sovereign.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," Holstiege said: "He has such an easy manner, it's a feat he accomplishes." By the way, this time it wasn't just men who presented themselves as singers.
The ladies "choir" Hohes C, "whose repertoire mainly includes evergreens from the 20s to the 60s, was also a guest.
Finally, there was poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had sat at his desk until three in the morning to create his own rhymes.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented fine-sounding poetry.
There was also a big raffle.
The proceeds will be used to finance a visit to the all-weather zoo for the children of the Albatros Youth Centre.

Volleyball: Women's League 3: USC II wins high-class derby against BW Aasee
The rising star is marching.
Three games, three wins - the reserve team of USC Münster under the patronage of Axel Büring is getting along really well in League Three.
No hint of shyness or tailgating, the independents are doing their thing.
And that in the 3: 0 (25: 15, 25: 23, 26: 24) against city rival BW Aasee really well.
"It wasn't crystal clear, but we made an impression," says the reasonably satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed: "This is a defeat that we can live with very well.
We are not unhappy. "On the contrary.
In the evening at a later birthday party of Ronja de Boer, the atmosphere was good, the game ticked off.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical illusion.
The visitors had a set point in the third set.
"If they bring it to the finish, a game like this can tip over," Büring knows from years of experience.
In the end, USC made everything clear with its experienced forces and brought the full yield to the finish.
'We're all aware of who's on the other side in a derby like this.
It doesn't break our neck.
I saw some really good volleys, "Annacker said of the 0-3 draw - and immediately went back to business as usual.
After just three days of play, it seems impossible to predict where the independents will go.
"It's just too early for that," says Axel Büring.
Only in one sense does he feel vindicated: "The third division has an incredibly good level.
This is not nearly comparable to regional league volleyball. "In any case, they no longer want to look down into the fourth division.
If the vest is not soiled in the next few weeks, they will have to look up.
However, a first assessment can only be made after ten or eleven games.
On Saturday we will first go to Emlichheim.
Aasee will compete in Essen on 14 October.

On her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
Heide Keller became a star on the "Dream Ship."
Now she has spoken candidly about how the show may have been partly to blame for her marriage breakdown to Hans von Borsody.
Her role as chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "Dream Ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018 she left the ship for good.
The series that made her a star could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), to whom she was married for ten years.
'That could've been one of the reasons.
Because I grew up with this work, travelled the world alone with a suitcase, and many colleagues I admired perceived me at eye level, "Keller says in an interview with" Bild am Sonntag. "
At first she had only ever been "the wife of Hans von Borsody," but that had changed with the "dream ship."
For now, the journalists only called Heide Keller.
'I don't know if he liked it that much. '
She thinks it's possible that her then-husband might have been jealous, but "like many men, Hans shied away from talking about problems and feelings."
Keller had always tried to be "the only right person for Hans von Borsody and he did not want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
In plain English, this means: I have disguised myself, "she continues.
She had always felt she was "not good enough for him.
He saw me as an emancipated woman who, in truth, I never was, even though I sometimes appeared cheeky and brave on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever. "
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes again, "even though I was afraid that it could also go wrong a second time."
The day before the civil ceremony I sat crying in the dressing room and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to von Borsody also failed.
Why did it never work out with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller had imagined love at the time "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I've been too naive in my approach to love. '
The moth, which regularly explores the nightlife of the city in the NZZ resort of Zurich, has this time ventured to the ZFF opening party.
Our moth is not a moth, but it is a little shy of light.
And the glare, in which a green carpet on Sechseläutenplatz is bathed, blinds him unduly.
But it's just a film festival, where more or less famous people want to bask in the spotlight.
So on this late Thursday evening, he staggers across the square to relieve himself briefly in the "Aquaclean-WC-Oasis."
This is the name of the public toilet facility sponsored by a large sanitary company, which is celebrating its premiere at the festival: the care facility on the ground floor of a new pavilion goes to great lengths to exude a luxurious ambience.
But this evening, for some reason, it stinks to heaven in the men's oasis.
So get out of here, over to the other side of the street: invited guests, who have just been entertained at the best level by the opening film "Green Book" in the cinema next door, celebrate the beginning of the festival with a party in the three-storey department store as every year.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: as is well known, the works on display come from all over the world.
What do you not have to come up with in an article about this festival, in order not to fall into surreptitious advertising for its 190 partner companies.
The butterfly ties a ribbon around the antennae, which a fairy godmother has given him, and two beefy bouncers actually wave him in generously.
Inside, the invited crowd, they dance long after midnight to live music or let the DJ dictate rhythms to which they shout at each other, and wash down exquisite appetizers with Cüpli.
In the delicatessen shop in the basement, oysters are waiting for slurping mouths, next door the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly sliced, a chocolate fountain bubbles.
And the hammer is: All the sales shelves full of exclusive products have not been cleared out for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without major losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The butterfly studies the sign at the escalator: "Wear a long dress, please be careful on the escalator."
If these are two separate instructions, he has lost his way in the dress code.
But it is more of a conditional construction, and it has certainly saved lives.
In the housewares department upstairs, the winged man tips a cocktail called "Golden Eye," made with espresso, to match the festival award.
This mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself, does not necessarily win the prize for the best drink.
And George Clooney, who has been promoting the brand for years, is not here for the evening either.
But then, between local celebrities, cash tables and kitchen items, a face that seems familiar to the observer passes by: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His lead actor is unlikely to be far behind.
And really: Viggo Mortensen, almost looking like a choirboy at the age of sixty, immediately walks through the crowd.
He is not gossiped at, he is not gawked at, at most he is stealthily squinting.
It is precisely for this restraint, often misunderstood as awkwardness, that international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with cumbia dance
Coach and former football star Diego Maradona is delighted with his team's victory.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona appears to have settled in well in his new home country of Mexico.
After his club Dorados de Sinaloa won 2-0, the 57-year-old coach danced to cumbia rhythms with a player in the dressing room, as seen in a video released on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in a yellow jersey, cheered on by the players.
The Mexican second division side had beaten the Leones Negros 2-0 on Saturday.
After the game, Maradona shouted into a TV camera "Always with my boys, always."
The 57-year-old has been coaching the Mexican club since early September.
Handball: FA League 1: ASV Senden "devastated" after last-minute collapse
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball league ASV Senden, could hardly believe it: "Such a bitter defeat." His charges were "devastated" after the unfortunate 29: 30 (12: 14) - bankruptcy - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday night at LIT Germania 2.
They had - as in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst - not played badly for long periods, the broadcasters.
Only the initial phase "we totally slept over," annoyed the ASV coach.
The hosts quickly led 8-1, and even the early break Bieletzki had taken did not bear fruit at first.
"But then suddenly a jolt went through the team," Bieletzki summed up the second quarter of an hour.
At the break, the deficit was only two goals.
In particular, Sending's best man, Marius Hintze, arrived at the stage one after the other.
After the change it got even better from a visitor's point of view.
After 33 minutes David Ernst equalised to make it 15-15, after which the relay changer led almost all the way.
Four minutes before the siren, the margin was still a seemingly reassuring three goals (29-26).
And then?
Let the impartial get in on the action.
Bieletzki is usually wary of blaming others.
But: The 120-second time penalty that Steffen Mühlhoff received "was a joke."
LIT had a good laugh and scored four more times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys fought really well, stood up well at the back against seven men and kept throwing at the empty goal.
Only they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now we have to get a damn victory," said Bieletzki, a full-back.
ASV goals: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hill (1).
Bavaria: Woman missing for 30 years - police dig for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of a then 18-year-old from Naila (Hof County), police are searching for the woman's remains.
Emergency workers dug up a road near Marxgrün on Saturday.
The road surface and several layers underneath were removed, the police and prosecutor's office said in a joint statement.
New evidence suggests the missing woman may have been buried not far from where she lived at the time.
The woman has been missing since November 4, 1986.
Investigators did not rule out a crime at the time.
Since last year, the Hof criminal police have been working intensively on the case together with the public prosecutor's office, according to the information.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Monument Protection Authority, the investigators used a ground radar to find an abnormality under the road near Marxgrün.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officers limited the area to a few metres.
The results of the excavations were due to be announced later in the afternoon.
The hacking attack on millions of Facebook users highlights the dangers lurking on the web.
However, users themselves can also provide additional security.
Instead of complicated strings of letters, users should use passphrases to secure their accounts on the net.
In addition, security updates, for example for Windows, should be installed quickly, and it does no harm to equip computers with anti-virus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of electric car maker Tesla, has escaped his imminent dismissal as boss of the billionaire firm.
He and the US Securities and Exchange Commission settled out of court a lawsuit over misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.
As part of the settlement, Musk and Tesla will each pay $20 million, and Musk will also step down as chairman for three years, a position similar to that of the German supervisory board chief.
By contrast, he is allowed to remain chief executive.
In the settlement, which has yet to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted wrongdoing.
The SEC had sued the world-renowned manager in U.S. federal court in Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who also heads space firm SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-making electric car pioneer, which is now valued at more than $50 billion on the stock market.
Musk is not aware of any blame
Musk said he had done nothing wrong and was saddened and disappointed by the lawsuit.
He has always acted in the interests of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk had written to his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might take the company off the stock market, paying $420 a share, with financing secured.
That would have valued Tesla at a total of $72 billion.
Musk later rowed back: Tesla will remain on the stock market.
Under the agreement, Tesla will now have to find an outside chairman, hire two independent board members and also set up a committee to oversee Musk's communications.
Football: Sturridge saves Liverpool: Klopp's team 1-1 Chelsea
Liverpool came from behind to draw 1-1 at Chelsea.
In the top game at Chelsea FC, the attacker, who had just been replaced by coach Jurgen Klopp, scored in the 89th minute to make it 1-1 (0-1).
After six straight wins, Liverpool dropped to second place.
Chelsea remain third, with Manchester City the new front-runners.
Eden Hazard gave Chelsea the lead in the 25th minute with his sixth goal of the season.
After that, Klopp's team missed the equaliser on several occasions.
Germany international Antonio Rudiger cleared on the line after a solo effort from Liverpool's top scorer Mohamed Salah (31).
Just before the end, Sturridge redeemed the Reds with a flick into the corner.
Premier League champions Manchester United are slipping deeper and deeper into crisis after their worst start to the season since 1989.
Controversial coach Jose Mourinho's side lost 1-3 at West Ham United and remain in mid-table with 10 points after seven matches.
The pressure will continue to mount on Mourinho ahead of Tuesday's Champions League match against Valencia.
Former Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno made his first Premier League appearance following an injury to Petr Cech.
Before Tuesday's Champions League game at Hoffenheim, Manchester City won 2-0 against Brighton & Hove Albion thanks to goals from Raheem Sterling (29th) and Sergio Agüero (65th).
Leroy Sané made it 1-0 and Ilkay Gündogan did not feature for the new leaders.
"Let's Dance" juror Joachim Llambi and wife Ilona separated
Joachim Llambi has probably separated from his wife Ilona.
The dance expert has become known through the RTL show "Let's Dance."
After 13 years of marriage Joachim Llambi (54) and his wife Ilona (45) are now separated.
Bild am Sonntag, citing Llambi's lawyer, reports on the break-up of the well-known presenter and dance expert.
"Our clients have separated amicably and amicably," lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser said, according to "BamS."
The most important thing for them now is the welfare of their two daughters.
The couple reportedly met in a pizzeria in 2003 and married two years later.
Joachim Llambi comes from Duisburg and was a successful tournament dancer and stockbroker.
Llambi became known on television through his work as a judge on the celebrity dance show "Let's Dance" on RTL, as well as through various appearances in quiz and entertainment programmes.

Polls: 46 percent don't want Merkel as chancellor until 2021
After the squabbles of the past few weeks, GroKo is cashing in on several poll lows.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in a poll - Angela Merkel is seen as critical.
Berlin - The AfD has overtaken the SPD for the first time nationwide in the Emnid Sunday poll for Bild am Sonntag.
In the weekly poll conducted by the polling institute, the AfD gained one point to 17 percent, while the SPD dropped one point compared to the previous week and ended up with 16 percent.
The CDU and CSU also lose one point, coming in at just 27 per cent.
This is the lowest level for the Union so far in the Sunday trend.
The Greens get 15 percent, the Left 11 percent and the FDP 10 percent.
If there were a federal election on Sunday, the governing parties SPD, CDU and CSU would together receive only 43 percent of the vote, according to Emnid.
As a result, the grand coalition has now lost the majority on the Sunday question in all the major research institutes - with the exception of Allensbach.
The governing parties consistently get 43 to 45 percent of the vote (Allensbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 federal election, they received a combined 53.4 per cent.
For the other parties, the range is also wide: the AfD, the second largest party in several polls, comes in at 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens have 12.5 to 17 per cent of the vote.
The Left is on average 10 per cent, the FDP 9 per cent.
For statistical reasons, such polls have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down, depending on the share of the vote.
But popular support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has also fallen significantly since the 2017 federal election.
Currently, only 48 percent of citizens think that Merkel is the right person to be chancellor, according to the Emnid poll conducted on behalf of BamS.
According to the survey, only one in two (50 per cent) currently wants the grand coalition to last until the next regular federal election in three years, while 41 per cent are in favour of a new election.
Another poll released on Saturday also showed a marked drop in Merkel's popularity.
Germans are also divided over whether Merkel should run for the CDU presidency again in December.
According to Emnid, 47 per cent are in favour and 44 per cent against.
Among Union supporters, 64 percent would like to be a candidate, while 35 percent would not.
Poster at Aldi: Reduced prices to make love
Will Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Anyone who says that in the age of Tinder there are no more romantic get-to-know-you stories should have a chat about turkey at Aldi.
Munich - In times of digital "fast food dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket exudes an almost anachronistic romance as a place to get to know the great love.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxer shorts at the table or your favourite pudding is still a better story for future grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The Tinder app has a reputation for being less of a contact and more of a slippery stock exchange.
We took the test: How do women react if you don't spend a lot of time talking about it in the first message?
Here's the amazing result.
It has real Hollywood love story potential when the happiness of love is preceded by an out-of-sight-lost-and-found plot.
When the guy gets in touch with his beloved at bio-putenfleisch @ gmx.de, it sounds a lot like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and the like - romantic comedy at it's best.
So it is to be wished to the author of this advertisement in an Aldi store unknown to us that she will also find her dream man, with whom she talked briefly about the "30 percent reduced organic turkey meat."
She definitely deserves her Hollywood-style happy ending for believing in the magic of getting to know each other.
Billerbeck: 500 lids for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludgeri School has been participating in the campaign "Caps against Polio - 500 Caps for a Life Without Polio."
Polio is short for poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by polioviruses.
The disease, known in German as polio, leads from symptoms of paralysis to death.
In Germany, polio is considered eradicated, but there are still three countries in the world where the disease occurs.
The cause of poliomyelitis, the polio viruses, can so far only be contained by vaccination, as stated in a press release.
Football: Reus and Zorc call for calm for Götze
Leverkusen (AP) - Borussia Dortmund sporting director Michael Zorc and captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public discussion about Mario Götze's form and fitness.
"We should stop worrying about Mario.
That's not good for the boy.
And that is not good for us, "Reus, who is a friend of Götze, told the TV channel Sky after the 4-2 win in Leverkusen.
Zorc had stressed before the game.
For him personally, this is not an easy situation.
Football: Eberl: No rush in contract talks with Hecking
Moenchengladbach (AP) - Manager Max Eberl of Bundesliga side Borussia Moenchengladbach sees no hurry in a possible contract extension with coach Dieter Hecking.
We haven't even talked about a treaty yet.
There's no fixed date when we're going to do that.
"But there will definitely be a moment when we sit down and talk," Eberl said on Sky television on Sunday night.
Football: District: Researcher appearance of VfL Wolbeck against SC Altenrheine is encouraging
There were moments in this still young season when Alois Fetsch took a hard line with his own.
He gave himself sparse words, the coach of the football district league VfL Wolbeck, withdrew at first (inwardly), in order to reflect on the lack of willingness to perform on the green.
All history.
In the meantime it is running again around the Brandhoveweg.
Taufrischer proof is the 1: 1 on Sunday against SC Altenrheine, in the past season only razor-thin past the promotion.
Yes, I am very happy with the performance.
'We've made the spaces tight and put pressure on the ball.
That was impressive, "Fetsch praised his boys and went to each and every one of them after the match to simply say" thank you "for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.
After the injury to Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - Luca Rehberg came in for him - the 4-4-2 changed almost seamlessly into a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes was in the front line waiting for balls.
Wolbeck had a lot more play in the first period.
And opportunities.
But Frerichs before his retirement (17th), the replaced Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
It almost paid off when, in minute 41, the SCA struck twice in the person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer in front of the Wolbeck box - goalkeeper Damian Hallas proved to be a master of his trade.
After the break VfL cheekily took full control.
Thewes narrowly failed from 18 yards.
Schroer, too, was late on a Thewes delivery after 58 minutes.
With the substitution of Miles Geske, Fetsch once again gave the left side a fresh start.
When Altenrhein's Chris Naberbäumer felled Robin Westhues in the 70th minute, there was an indirect free kick for the hosts 18 yards out.
The fouled man stepped up himself and demonstrated his danger to standards.
Westhues "right-footed shot struck the bottom left corner from the marksman's point of view - 1-0 (71.).
20 minutes left, which should be a hell of a long time.
And then this: VfL captain Florian Quabeck unfortunately flew the leather in the penalty area in the 80th minute.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the spot.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79.).
Wolbeck had to endure anxious minutes in the closing stages before Geske scored the winning goal from 12 metres in the 87th minute.
It might have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26. L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66. Geske) - Thewes

Eintracht Frankfurt win 4-1 against Hannover 96
Starting position: Four points after five match days - that was not enough for coach Adi Hütter.
Against Hannover 96, Eintracht Frankfurt finally wanted to secure their first home win.
Striker Ante Rebic, who was in the starting line-up for the first time after injury, should help.
Midfielder Luca Torró was also back after a pubic bone injury and should prevent the SBU from conceding more goals by standards with his strength of head.

Helicopter crashed in Kottingbrunn
On landing, there was an accident at the airfield.
The four occupants suffered minor injuries.
Around 2 p.m. on Sunday, there was a drama at the airport in Kottingbrunn.
There was turbulence when a helicopter landed, police confirmed to oe24.
The helicopter was hit by a gust of wind, crashed to the ground and came to a halt on its side.
The police, rescue and fire brigade were immediately notified.
The emergency services arrived at the scene of the accident with a large contingent.
The ÖAMTC emergency medical helicopter was also called out as a precaution.
Inmates only slightly injured
Fortunately, it all turned out to be largely harmless.
There is only one property damage.
The four occupants suffered only minor injuries and were able to return home on their own.
The exact circumstances surrounding the accident are not yet clear and are under investigation.
According to fire department spokesman Franz Resperger, there was a small fire, but it was quickly extinguished.
Allbright Foundation report: Women remain a rarity on company boards
As of September 1, only 8 percent of the board members were female, according to the report "The Power of Monoculture," which will be officially presented this Monday by the Allbright Foundation and was available in advance to the Deutsche Presse-Agentur.
"Companies will have to position themselves differently, otherwise the international competitors will pass them by," said Wiebke Ankersen, managing director of the foundation.
In the USA, Great Britain or Sweden, all-male management teams - with a few exceptions - are no longer conceivable.
In comparison, the gap makes German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented.
It's a different corporate culture.
Moreover, the slight increase in the proportion of women among German stock exchange companies can be attributed solely to positive impulses among the companies in the index of medium-sized stocks (MDax).
True, according to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of board members are female.
In the previous year, however, the figure was still 3.8 percent.
Among the 30 Dax companies - pioneers in recent years - the proportion of women has stagnated.
Most recently, 26 women served on the boards.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will recruit women more consistently in the coming year - in their own interest," said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement had signalled that they would not continue to make a voluntary commitment to increase the share from "zero percent" to date.
A different picture emerges with regard to the supervisory boards: as of 1 September, the proportion of women there was 30.5 percent - 45 more women and 68 fewer men than a year ago.
"If the same number of women were recruited to the boards each year, the proportion would reach 40 per cent by 2023," the report said.
Some even make a mess: Luxury car bodies: Which manufacturer earns the most per car?
Ferrari deserve best.
The Italians take 280,000 euros with every Ferrari sold and make 69,000 euros in operating profit.
Big cars, big profits: this slogan still applies today - in most cases.
Who makes the most profit per car among the high-end suppliers.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do luxury manufacturers collect for each car they sell?
"Autopapst" and professor of economics Ferdinand Dudenhöffer has dealt with this question.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
Ferrari made an operating profit of 69,000 euros for each car sold in the first half of the year - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only makes around 800 euros, while Tesla and Bentley even make a big profit on each car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the running with prices averaging between 33,000 and 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros in earnings before interest and tax.
On the day of her 38th birthday, tennis legend Martina Hingis announced on Twitter that she was becoming a mother for the first time.
The long-time No 1 ended her career with 25 Grand Slam titles - five in singles - at the end of last year.
In July she married Harald Leemann from Zug.
She did not reveal the date of birth.
Torchlight procession for the opening of the 60th Abtswinder Wine Festival
The tourism association in Abtswind opened its wine festival session with a torchlight procession.
For the 60th time, the association is organising the wine festivals, which from now on take place every Saturday in October in the large marquee on Rehweiler Straße.
To mark the start of the anniversary, those responsible marched through the town to the fairground to the sound of the marching band from Wiesenbronn.
The chairman of the tourism association, Wolfgang Starz, mayor Jürgen Schulz and wine princess Lisa Kursawe welcomed the guests in the already packed marquee. "To organise something like this for 60 years - that is an incredible achievement for a small town with 800 inhabitants.
That's something to be proud of, "Starz thanked all the volunteers.
Wine Princess Lisa II later toasted symbolically with the guests from the stage.
"It's great that so many have again found their way to us in Abtswind." Later, "Die Troglauer" provided the mood.
On Sunday, on which also the Abtswinder Kirchweih was celebrated, the association had fixed the drink prices on the occasion of the anniversary in the afternoon as 60 years ago.
A festive evening for the 60th Wine Festival will take place on Friday, October 5, in the guest's house, before the second round takes place a day later in the marquee.
In Bonn: Emergency medical car crashes into taxi
An ambulance stands badly damaged next to a road.
A 27-year-old female passer-by was fatally injured in the collision between the emergency vehicle and a taxi.
When emergency doctors are called, they are supposed to help - preferably even save lives.
Such a rescue trip came to a deadly end for a 26-year-old woman in Bonn.
Bonn - A 26-year-old pedestrian has been fatally injured in a collision between an emergency medical vehicle and a taxi in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and their driver were seriously injured, police said.
The 46-year-old driver of the emergency medical car had run over a red light with a blue light and a red light on Saturday afternoon.
He then collided with the taxi, which was travelling near Green, at a junction.
The ambulance crashed into a traffic light pole and a tree after the collision.
He captured the passer-by who died at the scene of the accident.
Driver of ambulance and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the ambulance were trapped in their vehicles with serious injuries and had to be freed by emergency services.
The 29-year-old emergency doctor, who was also seriously injured, was able to free herself but was unable to help the pedestrian.
Another emergency doctor called in tried - but to no avail.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
In close coordination with the Bonn public prosecutor's office, the police are investigating who is to blame for the accident.
Manchester United lose again, it's uncomfortable for Mourinho
After their embarrassing exit in the League Cup, Manchester United are now also losing in the seventh round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United, ManU lost 1-3. The manner of the defeat should still give something to talk about.
The scene was emblematic in the 74th minute, when the recovered Marko Arnautovic scored for West Ham to make it 3-1, just three minutes after Marcus Rashford had supposedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
Suspecting an offside on Mark Noble's pass, all the Manchester City defenders stopped and gave Arnautovic all the time in the world to shoot the ball past the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative climax of a performance that had already been inadequate for a long time.
The mood at United's city rivals Manchester City is very different at the moment.
The Citizens, coached by Mourinho's great rival Pep Guardiola, cruised to a comfortable 2-0 win over Brighton & Hove Albion.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke through the home team's defence for the first time.
Sergio Agüero, after a good hour and a double pass with the former scorer, ensured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and with it the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer league leaders
Three days after the 1-2 defeat in the League Cup, Xherdan Shaqiri scored for Liverpool in a 1-1 draw with Chelsea in the Premier League.
As with the Cup exit, Belgium's Eden Hazard was the best man for the Londoners.
The 27-year-old's goal in the 25th minute remained the only goal of the game until the closing stages.
Shaqiri, who came on for Mohamed Salah in the 66th minute, narrowly missed the equaliser after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge did better with his flick in the 89th minute.
After the Reds had started the week with an unblemished record, Chelsea could not be beaten for the second time.
First, the Londoners eliminated Jurgen Klopp's team in the Cup, and the draw in the league saw the Blues topple Liverpool from the top of the table.
Like City, the two London clubs Tottenham (at Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) celebrated 2-0 victories.
However, the Gunners fans, led by Granit Xhaka, had to wait until the 81st minute for a result against the surprise team from County Hertfordshire.
With nine minutes to go, Watford defender Craig Cathcart was unfortunate to concede an own goal from Alex Iwobi, only for Mesut Özil to score his third goal of the season just two minutes later.
Arsenal moved past Watford thanks to a fifth successive win and are now just behind big rivals Tottenham in fifth place, while promoted Wolverhampton continue to make a strong impression under their Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
Wolves remained unbeaten in the league for the fifth year in a row with a 2-0 win over Southampton and are in eighth place.
VW's core brand is missing: Paris Motor Show dominated by diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years, alternating with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially not an issue, but still omnipresent: the diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofits should not let go of the German car companies even at the industry meeting in Paris.
Together with competitors from all over the world, they will be showcasing their new products at the 2018 Motor Show in the French capital from next week.
The diesel doesn't really play a big role any more.
The possible exchange and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are to be negotiated with the government in Berlin until then, are nevertheless likely to be an important topic, at least behind the shiny scenes of the trade fair stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: the Volkswagen Group is present with Audi, Porsche and other subsidiaries, but not with the core VW brand itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are here with, among other things, their first all-electric models: the e-tron from Ingolstadt is due to hit the market at the end of the year, and the EQC from Stuttgart in 2019.
But both have already been officially presented.
BMW's iNext is not due to launch until 2021.
The focus in Paris is on the new 3-series.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors will be represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle manufacturers as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are also present in their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years alternating with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, just over one million visitors came.
At least 380 people have died in the severe earthquakes and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
The island was rocked by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had a magnitude of 5.9, the second 7.4.
Communications and transport links have been damaged and enormous damage has been caused.
After the quakes, the tsunami hit the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal city of Palu, hundreds had gathered on the beach for a festival.
It is feared that the number of victims will rise significantly.
The figures so far only come from Palu.
However, numerous other communities - along Sulawesi's west coast - are also affected.
About 150 bikers celebrate church service in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the closing service for the motorcyclists in the Peace Church in Eveking on Sunday with a team of helpers.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the closing service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the pastoral needs of the powerful two-wheeler drivers.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) takes place on the last Sunday of each month at Haus Nordhelle.
The bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the Friedenskirche in Eveking.
Around 150 bikers had gathered there on Sunday to celebrate a service that was anything but ordinary.
clock the cars were already lined up in front of the entrance portal of the church.
First the biker breakfast was on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cake or already with a hearty Currywurst.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
The sermon was given by the Rev. Dirk Grzegorek during the biker service.
The musical background was provided by singer-songwriter Valerie Lill.
"Although the bikers prefer blues-rock, Valerie Lill strikes a more poetic, calm tone," says the Rev. Frank Schröder.
This, too, was certainly a first in the history of the motorcycle service yesterday.
Füchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates a big party: After the apple comes the milk
And Borisch was also active during the actual day of action.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated to his amazed spectators step by step the process from ripe apple to apple juice.
From time to time Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and let them fill the apples into the large funnel.
With a little muscle power, the apples became a finely chopped mass.
Not many of the children could yet imagine how it would one day become a tasty drink.
But they were also able to look at this important work step on this late Friday afternoon.
Packed into moulds and wrapped in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the apple pieces, which looked a little like chopping material, layer by layer.
Thanks to a certain amount of technical support, the final work step was no longer so difficult.
The freshly squeezed juice gradually ran into a large container.
But the farmer from Füchtorf also had ready-bottled specialities with him.
So he opened his "treasure chest" and presented the latest feather whites to the older visitors.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was correspondingly high.
In a cosy atmosphere, the parents got into conversation, while the children were not only able to follow the apple pressing process, but also discovered the built-up bouncy castle for themselves.
Active members of the Füchtorf camaraderie of former soldiers were also involved in the festival and invited to entertaining games at some stations.
The local association will also offer a day of action in the coming year.
In that case, however, Gregor Krützkamp stressed, the home in the heart of the asparagus village will not be the place of action.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the subject matter: after all, it will be all about the milk.
1: 4 against Frankfurt: Hanover with fourth bankruptcy of the season: "Crappy situation"
Frankfurt / Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat in a row, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professionals from Hannover 96 around him and encouraged them.
However, there was not much positive to see in the 1: 4 (0: 2) of last place in the table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a crappy situation, but you have to get out of it as a team," said 96-year-old professional football player Pirmin Schwegler, adding: "Of course it's disappointing, because you always put a lot of effort into it."
The further winless Lower Saxony, for whom only Florent Muslija (86.) scored, stand with two points at the bottom and are in their current condition a relegation candidate.
Led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, however, Frankfurt celebrated their first home win of the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45. + 1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) scored the goals for the DFB Cup winner in front of a crowd of 46,300. After the successful dress rehearsal for the Europa League game against Lazio Rom, he advanced to the middle of the table with seven points.
Croatia's World Cup runner-up Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous attacking move on his debut and was never able to get a grip on Hannover's defence.
The striker, long out of action after the World Cup, showed with his pace and assertiveness why he is so valuable to Eintracht.
In addition to Rebic, Brazilian Allan, on loan from Liverpool FC, was in the starting line-up for the first time for the Frankfurt side, who started brightly.
A header from Lucas Torró (17th) deflected into the net brought danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller, in a promising position, was stopped at the last moment by the 96 defence around Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-lived Kevin Wimmer (back).
The lead for the hosts was almost inevitable and fully deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penalty area after a deflected corner, Haller extended his header in front of goal, where Ndicka only had to put his foot down.
It was the first Bundesliga goal for the defender, who joined from French second division side AJ Auxerre in the summer.
And Frankfurt eased up before the break.
This time Haller matched his storm partner Rebic, who skillfully tanked his way through and gave 96-goalkeeper Michael Esser no chance.
At half-time, Hannover coach Breitenreiter reacted to the poor performance of his team and brought in two new offensive forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxony played now somewhat more courageously forward, igniting ideas remained however until shortly before the end, when at least the follow-up goal succeeded.
The Hessians were much more efficient there.
After just under an hour Rebic launched a solo and then laid across to De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was just a show for the Frankfurt side against overwhelmed visitors, with Jovic also scoring with a minute to go.
The Morlaixplatz turns into a party mile

Geisingen: Geising Christians celebrate Holy Cross Festival
The Catholics of Geising celebrate the feast of the Holy Cross on 14 September or the Sunday after.
The festive service will take place in the city church, followed by a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the final blessing.
The Church of the Holy Cross houses the shot Christ, which dates back to the Thirty Years War and which, according to legend, was shot at by a Swedish soldier.
Blood then flowed from the gunshot wound.
This resulted in a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ, which then also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is not finished until today, only the sanctuary is standing, the missing nave is indicated by the trees.
In his homily, Father Adolf Buhl reminds us that the cross is a sign of hope, consolation and life.
Despite its importance for the Geising parish, the service was poorly attended.
After the service, the procession to the Church of the Holy Cross took place and the ecclesiastical part of the Feast of the Cross ended with the final blessing.
For many years, the Catholic church choir has been inviting people to the secular part of the festival in the Catholic parish hall.
The choir members provided visitors with hearty food as well as a large selection of cakes and weather-adapted, farm ice cream.
In the afternoon, the parish offered guided tours around the town church. On behalf of the parish, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed the visitors about the damage to the facade, roof, sandstone works and windows, as well as the upcoming construction work, which will continue into next year.
After the scaffolding has been in place for some time, it has been possible to determine the damage more precisely and to prepare the individual tenders more specifically.
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage already existing a few years ago has become greater, but more has also been discovered, which was only made possible by the inspection by means of scaffolding.
The base plastering work has been completed, the natural stone work is to be started before the winter and it is hoped that a good half of this work will be completed this year.
Inauguration: New residence hall in the Neu-Ulm Münsterblickstraße
The Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller is opening a new residential home for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
All those present at the inauguration agreed that "a very special house" will now be handed over to its purpose in Münsterblickstraße.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the residence hall of Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller for some time now depend on the special architecture of the new building.
Wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas were taken into account by architect Rudolf Bader in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago, when the former officers "building of the US Army was put to the test for residents with a mobile phone cap:" The house was getting old and out of date in terms of equipment, "Bader explained in retrospect.
In 2016, the diggers moved in to demolish the house.
The new building should be designed as friendly and bright as possible, so that the residents can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens new residence hall
Lebenshilfe invested around 4.6 million euros in the new building.
The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros, the district of Swabia 450,000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction work has remained within the planned framework - both in terms of time and money.
The managing director of Lebenshilfe, Jürgen Heinz, also thanked him for this.
The balancing act between a barrier-free and at the same time fire-proof construction has not always been easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many specifications, which allowed the inhabitants to experience the freedom of being able to move without outside help.
The head of the social administration of the Swabian district, Gertrud Kreutmayer, made a similar comment: "The house is oriented towards the special needs of its residents, who need tools to be mobile."
The cosiness and functionality have been well combined, Kreutmayer said.
And further: "The property in this situation is a real stroke of luck, because it can no longer be acquired in this way in the current situation."
In total, the new residence hall in Münsterblickstraße offers space for 30 people with disabilities on an area of almost 1500 square metres, divided into three residential groups.
Heinz, managing director of Lebenshilfe, is proud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed on a tariff basis.
Germany: Schwesig laments differences between East and West
Berlin - On the eve of the Day of Unity, the deputy leader of the SPD, Manuela Schwesig, appealed to all compatriots not to resign themselves to the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after nearly 30 years of unity.
We must not be satisfied with these differences, "the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern told the" Tagesspiegel am Sonntag. "
The goal must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It was unacceptable that East Germans worked on average longer than people in West Germany, but were paid 15 percent less.
"Almost 30 years after German unification, I can't explain that to anyone," Schwesig said.
North Korea: Is this cute dog ending the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan hunting dog is meant to smooth the waters between the two Koreas.
In an effort to ease relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has given South Korean President Moon Jae-in two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs as a gift.
Moon's office said Sunday that the two dogs, who are about a year old, reached their recipient as early as Thursday.
They passed through the border town of Panmunjom along with three kilograms of dog food to make it "easier for the animals to get used to."
The dogs with the thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They are part of the national heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The North announced the gift of friendship at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in mid-September.
The two countries also agreed to compete together in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to jointly bid to host the 2032 Olympic Games.
As part of the rapprochement, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test site for rocket engines.
Austria's turbulent history as reflected in 99 documents
What is Austria?
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated in this commemorative year for almost ten months now, numerous new books have been published, most of which answer this question in retrospect of the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and Director General of the Austrian State Archives, takes a very different approach in the magnificent "Picture Book" of Austria, which will be published on 1 October.
New week, new opportunity for the government
Back to business as usual - that is the unofficial motto for the Grand Coalition's working week, which begins today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and her ministers from the CDU, SPD and also from the CSU did not conjure up the mantra of a "return to business as usual."
This may have led some craftsmen, women doctors, cashiers and otherwise employed citizens in this country to the legitimate question of what is actually the difference between work and professional work, but so be it.
If the Federal Government is now ready to return to its mission - to govern - it should not now be prevented from doing so by debating concepts.
Whether the Union and the SPD can actually achieve something together after the provocations and embarrassments of the last few weeks will probably be shown as early as Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the governing parties meet for the coalition committee.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round regularly in order to defuse conflicts early on; a lesson from all this dispute.
First, however, with the diesel retrofits and the skilled labour immigration law, conflicting issues are once again on the agenda.
CSU transport minister Scheuer wants the car companies to get off lightly with exchange premiums, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the obligation to technically retrofit older diesels.
While a rapprochement has emerged in the diesel crisis over the weekend, the Union and the SPD are still far apart on the planned skilled migration law.
The SPD is calling for a stay perspective for rejected asylum seekers who are working or undergoing training.
The Union is strongly opposed to the "change of track" from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be another row among the coalition partners - and how could it be otherwise?
Not Equal and Equal has joined forces to form GroKo, but three partners with, in some cases, very different views of society and priorities.
Controversy is good.
Without dispute, a society marked by such diverse, sometimes conflicting interests cannot move forward.
In order to be constructive, however, disputes must not again be exaggerated for party-tactical reasons into the question of being or not being.
This is still about politics, not theatre.
The Union and the SPD should argue - but always keep an eye on the reality of people's lives.
What is feasible and good for many?
With this key question, both the diesel and lane change issues can be resolved pragmatically - and thus confidence can be regained.
Above all, that is what the people's parties must fight for now.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in her sights
Does the Minister for Employment, of all people, violate the applicable law of service?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look.
Her colleagues had been working "night and day" on social care reform, an exuberant social care minister reported when she presented it two weeks ago.
With list-mushroom-mandatarin Daniela Holzinger the statement of Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) meets with astonishment - she brings the thing now via question into the parliament.
She said she believed "the minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm for the deployment of her team and in no way to announce breaches of applicable service law in front of running cameras."
Even so, she said, she now has questions to "absolve Har <unk> tinger of any suspicion."
Police tear up a road in search for woman's body
The police declined to comment for a long time.
Now there is confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, digging has been taking place on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben.
The line is closed in the Marxgrün area until Monday.
It follows that investigators had previously used an archaeology dog.
Together with his guide, the dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, was finally able to narrow down the relevant area to a few metres in repeated use.
In addition, together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the highest Bavarian monument protection authority, a soil anomaly was discovered in the area of the said section of road.
The Crown Prosecution Service and the Criminal Investigation Service have been working on the missing persons case for more than a year.
Again and again, a bike path near Marxgrün was closed and examined with sonar equipment, because investigators suspect that Heike's body may have been buried here in the course of the new construction of the state road 30 years ago.
Colour powder and eggs: Riots in Barcelona ahead of Catalonia anniversary
Monday marks the first anniversary of Catalonia's controversial independence referendum.
But even before that, there are riots.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Clashes between separatists and police broke out in central Barcelona on the eve of the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum on October 1, 2017.
Catalan security forces were attacked by pro-independence protesters with paint powder, among other things, as they tried to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and Civil Guard.
Around 3,000 officers from the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil police units wanted to hold a rally to honour their colleagues who were deployed at polling stations during last year's referendum, which was deemed illegal.
There had also been violence at the time in an attempt to prevent citizens from voting.
Catalan police had formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of separatists and central government security forces separate, Spanish media reported.
Some of the approximately 6,000 separatists then tried to break the police chain by force, throwing paint bags and eggs at the officers, among other things.
Six people were arrested and 24 others were slightly injured, it said, citing authorities.
Monday marks the first anniversary of the independence referendum.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to secede the wealthy region from Spain, the central government in Madrid placed Catalonia under receivership in the autumn of 2017.
The then regional president, Carles Puigdemont, fled into exile in Belgium.
Other politicians have also moved abroad.
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement, however, remain in custody.
New elections were held in the region in December.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, sequestration was brought to an end.
But the new regional president, Quim Torra, also insists on the "right to self-determination" of Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Gathered perplexity: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen part ways without a goal
Red-and-white awls continue to appear on the spot.
Even at FC Gütersloh it was only enough for a 0-0 draw.
In front of a crowd of 438 in the Heidewald Stadium, they turned out to be helpless at the end and the third last.
The first half was poor from the entertainment point of view.
Those who therefore preferred to get a beer or a sausage, could do so without worry.
There was no danger of missing a scoring chance because there were virtually none.
First shot after half an hour
Gütersloh's Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) shot on goal of the entire match in the 28th minute.
The Ahlener had the best - and in principle the only real - opportunity when Cihan Yilmaz forced FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling into a parade with a shot from the penalty area after 32 minutes.
The hosts were even more innocuous.
Their most effective action was to make an early change.
Striker Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, Sinan Aygün came in for him.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the growing boredom.
In the 48th minute Sebastian Mützel took aim from 18 metres just above the box and after an hour the Gütersloh players also made their first offensive appearance.
After a conquest of the ball by Matthäus Wieckowicz it was fixed.
Nick Flock (62.) "crowned" the briskly presented counter-attack over Sinan Aygün with a lax shot into the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, they followed up with a header from Wieckowicz (66th) after a corner ball from former Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut responded, first bringing in Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60.) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70.).
It made a difference - nothing.
The Ahlens did not achieve more than visual superiority thanks to their own initiative.
It wasn't until the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had his last chance, but even that came to nothing.
Angelo Daut tried to emphasize the positives afterwards: "I like the fact that we played to zero." But unfortunately, the zero was also in front.
"We were not as dangerous this time as we were against Holzwickede, even though our opponent had no desire to play here," stated RW Ahlen's interim coach.
Offensively, "everything was rippling a little bit" against a team that "just wanted to defend.
In any case, I didn't feel we could get a goal against them, "Daut said.
Unfortunately for him, as a spectator, you did not feel as if his team could score a goal.
The performance was too poor for that.
Reckenfelder Thanksgiving Market: Fortunately, there are enough Kreimers
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfeld table dispensary, for whom these donations are intended, are pleased about this.
The volunteers assure: "These donations will also remain in Reckenfeld."
At the opening, the sky was bright blue, but the square was still a bit empty, but that was to change during the day.
"It's so sociable here, that's why we're here today," said one visitor.
As always, the organiser of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in Kiepenkerl outfits with a good pinch of humour.
For the Brockmann couple, who were supposed to be weighed against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer stepped in at short notice.
Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has fallen ill.
But there are plenty of Kreimers.
And the "substitute" did not miss the opportunity to entertain the ever-increasing number of visitors in between.
This was so well received that some folk songs were sung along at a late hour.
"Just great," said a delighted Marcel Kreimer.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to accommodate the opening date in his schedule this time.
He is pleased about the many active people with their stands, among them mainly clubs.
"Actually there should be no such thing as a plaque at all," he nevertheless thanked for the action of the male choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the efforts of all those who worked at the stands and also included the other festivals that took place in September and the "clean up" campaign.
Our garden city gives itself a colourful coat of paint - here goes something.
Then the May wreath was removed by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire brigade and brought to the winter quarters.
At many stands, work was done for the physical well-being.
Everything from sweet to savory was available.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only been living in Reckenfeld for a year, got creative with his scroll saw.
He had veneer work, beer mats with Reckenfeld motifs and much more on offer.
Three beekeepers from Reckenfeld offered a speciality: "Reckenfelder Honey," brought along by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschluter.
The latter still has a specialty with it.
Honey cake in a jar, of course with honey from my own production.
Little Elsa had to grab it again and again, that's how good the cake tasted.
It is the conviviality that allowed the visitors to linger long into the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Smears with a local political message: No successful advertising for skate park
In Lengerich, unknown people have promoted the construction of a skate park in a hardly conducive way.
In several places there are corresponding smears, says Jürgen Kohne of the city administration on request of the WN.
In at least one case, criminal charges have been filed with the police for damage to property.
The three words "Skatepark für Lengerich!" are emblazoned in large letters on signs at, among others, the Gempt Hall and the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that a corresponding lettering on the advertising sign on the staircase to the Gempt Bistro had already been discovered after the vocational election fair on 19 September.
Since the short message had apparently been left "only" with an edding at the time, it could easily have been removed.
"A few days later, it was there again, this time sprayed on," Rottmann said.
He assumes that the relevant advertising sign will have to be replaced.
A special note is given to this particular case by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the board.
If the skate park is built, its realization should also be made possible by sponsors.
There are already commitments, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the municipal department of school, sport and culture, without naming names.
It is quite possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to the companies that appear on the smeared board.
Local politics and administration have been dealing with the issue of skate parks for years.
After the old one had been dismantled at the LWL clinic, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
In the end, the majority of the council voted in favour of the fire station car park.
However, this request was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against a building at this point.
A U-turn followed at the end of June.
The members of the Main and Finance Committee now voted unanimously in favour of the Gutenberg School site.
Jürgen Kohne says about the current state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The city council would then have the final say.
He said he expects a decision to be made this year so that if there is a yes vote, construction could begin in 2019.
Air traffic control bottleneck gets worse
Frankfurt / Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, in 2019 we will have strong winds and then the storm will come," the head of the air traffic control union, Matthias Maas, told the German Press Agency ahead of the aviation summit in Hamburg on 5 October.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight cancellations is the long-known shortage of staff at European air traffic control services, for which there is no quick solution.
"Airlines and airports can make rapid improvements for the coming year, but it takes four to five years to train new controllers," the union official said.
Across Europe, the market for fully trained air traffic controllers has been emptied.
In the center of Karlsruhe alone for the surveillance of the upper German airspace about a hundred people were missing.
Maas again criticised the fact that various air transport unions were not invited to the summit.
Representatives of the federal government, the federal states, air traffic control, airlines and airports will meet in the Hanseatic city on Friday to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional compression of work and overtime, it will not be possible without us," explained the head of the GdF, which has many members at the German air traffic control company.
Maas again blamed guidelines from the EU Commission for the pilot's plight.
Transport forecasts for the regulatory period, which runs until 2019, were far too low.
The resulting cost targets and staff savings at national air navigation services are now having a full impact on the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to lobby in Brussels for regulations that "do not further restrict air traffic control services."
Currently, the EU guidelines are being coordinated until 2024 and further tightening is to be feared.
He said the EU was under constant pressure from airlines to lobby.
"Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown themselves in recent years," Maas said.
He said he hoped the high cost of delays would prompt a rethink by airlines.
The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if Deutsche Flugsicherung (DFS) offers a "coherent training and future pact," Maas said.
The admission of 120 pilot pupils annually over the next five years, announced so far, is just enough to compensate for the age-related departures.
The necessary personnel build-up is not yet connected with this.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board votes in favour of Group restructuring
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously in favour of the plans to restructure the Group.
According to the will of Thyssenkrupp interim CEO Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed CEO at the meeting on Sunday, the crisis-hit group is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies are to have their registered office in Essen and be listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional staff cuts in addition to the cuts already known in the administration.
After two resignations, the controlling body has only eight heads on the capital side.
This is opposed by ten representatives of the employees.
However, the final decision is expected to be made at a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is to include, among other things, the 50 percent share from the merged steel business with Indian partner Tata.
The second company, Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, is to combine its elevator and supply business.
Barcelona: Violence at demonstrations by police and Catalan independence supporters.
Two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police and Catalan pro-independence demonstrators in Barcelona have resulted in violent clashes, with many injured.
According to the municipality, about 3,000 police officers from across Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as about 6,000 pro-independence demonstrators.
The Catalan police had tried with a large contingent to keep the two protest marches away from each other.
But pro-independence protesters repeatedly tried to break through the security barrier, according to the force.
They allegedly attacked the officers with paint and projectiles.
There were also scuffles between the participants of the various protest marches, according to the reports.
Rescue workers said 24 people were injured.
Police said there had been six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
With their demonstration, the police had wanted to pay tribute to their colleagues who had acted almost exactly a year ago against the independence referendum in Catalonia, which was banned by the Spanish central government.
At the same time they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel it is unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn significantly more than they do.
The demonstrators saw it as a provocation that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona, of all places.
"Why did they come here to protest?" 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez asked the AFP news agency.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they messed us up a year ago.
A 31-year-old police officer from the Balearic Islands, who wished to give his name only as Daniel, denied the charge.
"Of course we want to support our comrades who last year did only their duty: defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona because it is a big European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues "did not come to provoke," the police officer said.
Breakdown allowed access to personal data of British ministers
A security flaw in a mobile phone app meant that the personal details of Tory ministers and MPs were temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unidentified people after the glitch became public a day before the Tory party conference in Birmingham.
Two people trapped on B217
Hanover police report a serious traffic accident on Sunday morning on the main road 217, Hamelner Chaussee, at the exit of Wettbergen in the direction of Ronnenberg.
Two people have died after their car crashed into a tree.
The car is currently on fire.
Emergency services are on the scene.

Football: Juve coach praises Ronaldo's best game after top-flight match
According to Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri, the Portuguese star striker "played the best game of the evening together with the half-hour of Valencia," after the record-breaking champions "3-1 win over Napoli.
For the coach, even without an own goal, the expensively purchased star was the decisive man in the important match against the chasing pack.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and is doing well," Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical errors, Ronaldo was very good with our first goal - and from that moment on we grew.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three assists, Juve turned the game around after falling behind early on through a goal from Dries Mertens in the 10th minute and hung on for the time being.
The scorer, brought in from Real Madrid, first laid on former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who provided the lead with a double (26 / 49).
And Ronaldo's header from a corner also set up a goal for defender Leonardo Bonucci (76th), who only had to push in just before the goal-line.
"He gives a lot of assists," praised the coach.
But Allegri also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the record goalscorer in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
"We need to get even better at serving him," the coach said.
Currently Juve's top scorer is Mandzukic with four goals - Ronaldo has three to his name.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, the superiority of Juventus seems to become even more overwhelming.
Seven wins in seven games is an unblemished streak in Serie A. The champions of the past seven years are already six points clear of Napoli on 21 points.
The second-placed side, coached by former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti, were not without a chance against Torino.
But at the latest after the dismissal of the already warned Mario Rui (58th), the top game was decided.
The Portuguese was forced off the pitch with a yellow and red after going too hard on Paulo Dybala.
"We played well against a good Napoli," the Turin coach said.
Emre Can has also been linked with a move.
The Germany international has established himself at Juve.
He has played in all seven of Liverpool's league games this season.
The midfielder also played in the Champions League match against Valencia, which Allegri referred to as the "half hour": Ronaldo was sent off in the Turin side's 2-0 win and is suspended for Tuesday's home game against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes his name
Rapper Kanye West has attracted attention with a particularly bizarre appearance on the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" over the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume caused frowns and question marks among the audience.
The 41-year-old also announced a name change just in time for the release of his new album.
From now on, he will only be called "Ye," according to the musician.
"The creature formerly known as Kanye West," he tweeted, referring to the late singer Prince when he dropped his stage name.
The pseudonym is not news, however.
Already the tenth album was released under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist explained that "Ye" has a religious meaning for him.
"I think" Ye "is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means" you, "" the rapper said.
Football: A1 Münster: Finally!
Done!
Hoetmar's coach, Averhage, made no secret of his disappointment.
That was a poor game from us today.
The opponent was simply more handy, we hardly ever presented him with any problems. "Accordingly, the list of Hoetmar shooting possibilities reads thin.
There are only two scoring chances in 90 minutes, so it is rare for games to be positive.
Soccer League A1: SC Hoetmar defeats SG Sendenhorst 0-2 (0-1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
SG also had only two chances in the first round, but Maik Krause took advantage of the first from an acute angle to take an early lead (7th).
Steffen Uphus could have raised the score in the 43rd minute, but after great preparatory work by Krause he missed a free-kick.
The hosts only had a double chance when Moritz Höne failed to connect with goalkeeper Jos Schuhmacher and Jan Blome also found his way into the Sendenhorst keeper in the second half.
After the break, the visitors became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49.), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (69.) all forgave.
Niklas Eilmann was also unable to use a trading metre - Louis Kortenjann had saved with his hand on the goal line and saw red for it - for the visitors (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide poked the ball over the line was the game decided (81.).
"We had harshly criticised each other before, but that was different today than in the last few weeks," was Florian Kraus's conclusion.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90. Leibig), Turl.
Goals: 0-1 Krause (7th), 0-2 Berheide (81st).
Red card: Kortenjann (75. / Hoetmar).
Football: A2 Münster: Spectacular football in nightmares: GW Albersloh defeats Concordia 3-4
"I don't know what to make of it," he said.
"We didn't get access to them at all." By which he presumably meant the wing pliers with Colby McGill and Janis Kroeger, but probably also all the other green-whites who caught the eye with their collective offensive drive.
Still, he was able to laugh: "A dirty win," he said, winking cheekily and pulling away from his players, but there was a sense of relief that they had pulled away with three points.
Mind you, after a duel between two teams, one of which, Albacht, is playing for the championship and the other, Albersloh, is fighting for the league title.
GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back on the 90 minutes that lay behind him with understandably mixed feelings.
"That was by far our best performance of the season," he says.
'The way we came back from 0-2 down, the way we fought back throughout the game against one of the top teams in the league, it's been phenomenal. '
This makes it all the more bitter that you now have to go home empty-handed.
Top scorer Lars Zymner gave the hosts the lead with his 12th goal of the season (24th).
He needed exactly two touches of the ball in that game for that goal.
He made it 2-0 via the left-hand side for Fabian Fröhning (39.).
We knew that, but you can't take a player like that out completely.
'It was crazy what he did, 'Lewandowski said of the quality of his opponent.
Just before the change of sides, his own team equalised: McGill's free-kick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe into the long corner (45th).
After the change of sides it was again McGill who scored the equaliser (59th).
After that, it went back and forth.
It was a crisp, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albacht again (64th), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann equalised (69th).
Despite being outnumbered, Albersloh was not able to counter the last Concordia hit (80th) again.
We now need to focus our full attention on Wednesday.
'The game against Schapelle, that's what we need to win now, 'Lewandowski said.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kroeger (87. Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87. Bareksai).
Goals: 1: 0 Zymner (24th), 2: 0 Fröhning (39th), 2: 1 McGill (45th), 2: 2 McGill (59th), 3: 2 Nübel (64th), 3: 3 P. Horstmann (69th), 4: 3 Jülkenbeck (80th).
Yellow-red: Atalan (74 / 1).
Football: TSV Strasbourg fights for a point against Primus
There was no winner in the regional league duel between TSV Straßberg and FV Biberach.
The league leader had actually come for three points, but the team of coach Oliver Pfaff stood very well and in the end the game ended 0: 0.
Media: The entire executive committee of Dynamo Dresden resigned
The entire executive committee of second division football club Dynamo Dresden has resigned, according to media reports.
Several media outlets in the evening unanimously referred to a joint letter from the Committee of the Saxons.
There was no confirmation from the club at first.
The reason for the withdrawal is said to be internal power struggles at the former Bundesliga club.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of pomp
It's good that he's gone.
There are few guests of state whose departure in Germany provides as much relief as Recep Tayyip Erdogan's.
The Turkish President spent three days in Berlin and Cologne, and many had thought that he should not have been invited at all.
Evangelical Academy Tutzing: Celebrity guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy of Tutzing offers about 80 conferences until the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has signalled that he will personally pick up the Tolerance Prize in Tutzing.
The term of office was too short for Christian Wulff: As Federal President, he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after Wulff was there as a guest.
This is how Academy Director Udo Hahn counted him when he proudly said: "All Federal Presidents and Federal Chancellors have already been with us." However, the fact that celebrities keep turning up at the Academy in Schloss Tutzing was also a topic during the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October, singer-songwriter Konstantin Wecker will take part in a conference on spiritual experience from a philosophical perspective, and on 29 September the writer Frido Mann will attend a conference on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has also confirmed that he will personally accept the "Tolerance Prize" awarded to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which will also be awarded to television presenter Dunja Hayali in another category (as we reported).
The 80 or so meetings up to mid-2019 have a lot to offer.
"The pension is just not safe!" reads a conference title.
"SOS on Europe's borders" - this is how the Academy describes the "risky and deadly route across the Mediterranean."
"And to a meeting on Syria:" Barbarism without limit. "
Arms deals, destruction, torture, death - war makes a mockery of every humane idea. "
The spectrum ranges from structural racism in society to the gap between rich and poor to the radical transformation of work through digitalisation.
Academy Director Hahn was convinced: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to look for solutions, or at least partial solutions."
At a meeting to mark the 200th anniversary of the
s birthday, some expect more visitors to the direction of criticism of capitalism, while others expect a tendency "from the far left to the centre."
What about neutrality?
"We are 100 percent a subsidiary of the Evangelical Church," said study leader Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100 percent neutral."
Music Cabaret: Gender Understanding with the Heart - Wolbeck - Westphalian News
The musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christuskirche in Wolbeck was "suitable for both adults and men."
As a cabaret performer, Teubner buttoned up gender understanding, not only with humour and warmth of heart for the (felt) woman and the (felt) man and whatever else there might be, but also with music.
She used the mini-guitar and also mastered her violin.
At the grand piano sat Ben Süverkrüp.
On the one hand, he is the male sparring partner, who sometimes speaks right up to the end of the movement, and on the other, he is a true pianist: Süverkrüp Teubner accompanies with such congenial harmony that some may have wished for a solo.
There was, too, with Beethoven and Chopin, but in a different way, in the way that suited the theme of the evening.
Teubner had brought a paradox into play: the satisfaction in a man comes when he has a partner, but she does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, is of no use.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same thing: what would have emerged from Mozart's composing if "das Nannerl" had unexpectedly opened the door?
Thus Süverkrüp glides over in improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden" into the "Lied vom Tod," and from Mozart's Symphony in G minor into a playful little dance.
There was a huge round of applause and "Bravo" from the packed hall.
Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, presented flowers to the chansonette.
But chairwoman Heidemarie Markenbeck did not let herself be deprived of an additional thanks.
She had the idea to treat the duo to performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt as well as one in Wolbeck.

Controversial tech billionaire Elon Musk may remain chief executive of electric car maker Tesla, but must step down as chairman of the board.
Musk also agreed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to pay a double-digit million dollar fine, the SEC said.
The background is Musk's surprise announcement in August that he would take Tesla off the stock market.
In its lawsuit, the SEC accused Musk of making false and misleading statements.
Breaking point.
Following a bus accident on the A5 in Baden-Württemberg, the police have slightly revised down the number of victims.
He said 10 passengers were slightly injured instead of 15.
All have since been released from the hospital, he said.
The French bus driver had remained in hospital for one night for observation.
He will be released later in the day, a police spokesman said.
The cause of the crash of the long-distance bus near Bruchsal is still unclear.
The long-distance bus had crashed head-on into a guardrail on Saturday morning.
Handball: Women's national league: Ahlener SG narrowly keeps the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlen women had problems above all with the third league player Carolin Stallmann, who alone marked ten goals.
'I was actually happy with the defence, only one player scored too many goals, 'he said.
We didn't get a grip on them, "said ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more annoyed by the many missed chances.
His team lacked concentration in the closing stages this time.
The ASG therefore ran almost to the end of a deficit, was behind at the break with 11: 12 and later with 15: 18 (45.).
It was only towards the end that the hosts "wider bench made a decisive impact.
In addition, Aydogdu set back Merle Klement on the left wing, who then made "extremely clever the decisive goals."
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pump, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5 / 3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3. League Women: Top performance of the BSV Ostbevern in the top match at VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyball players of BSV Ostbevern have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd League West.
The Blue-Whites won 3-1 at second-division relegation club VC Allbau Essen.
"That was a huge step for a cool season.
It makes sense to play in the top third of the league.
We have now worked that out, "said a delighted coach Dominik Münch after an almost flawless performance by his team in the toppled championship leader.
The guests dominated the first round almost at will.
Over 4: 1, 16: 10 and 22: 12 he went with 25: 15 to the runner-up of the previous year.
Essen accepted in the two-bar, but did not come into play.
We kept them busy.
Our opponent pitched with high risk, but also produced quite a few tickets.
In the second set the BSV led already with 12: 8. "Essen has changed the acceptance to three-bar.
We couldn't hold the serve pressure.
Food got sucked in, and we got lulled a little bit, "Münch continued.
At 18: 17 the volleyball players from the Ruhr area had the lead for the first time.
Ostbevern fended off four set balls at 19: 24, but the fifth attempt found its target.
"The game was a class better now," the head coach said of the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed significantly with their serves to the fact that the BSV turned the tide in the third section from 14: 16 to 25: 21.
Münch: "We played consistently and calmly there."
Over 7: 3 and 15: 13 brought the Blue and White passage four with 25: 22 on their side.
Vera Horstmann was voted the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier also had an excellent day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish community: Mosque opening a missed opportunity
The Turkish Community in Germany (TGD) has criticised the manner of the inauguration of the large Ditib Mosque in Cologne by the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left a shambles in German-Turkish relations, which can only be swept together with difficulty," the chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, told the editorial network Germany.
Both the Turkish and the German sides would have missed the chance for a joint, conciliatory appearance.
"Instead of standing side by side with German leaders to emphasize the belonging of Muslims to Germany, Erdogan has used the date for his own purposes," Sofuoglu complained.
The extensive exclusion of the German public had "reinforced many reservations."
Heimatverein Nottuln: Offer has already been established
After the long summer break, it's finally Folktreff time again.
On 18 October (Thursday) at 7.30 pm, the Heimatverein Nottuln is already holding its fifth Nottulner Folktreff in the fireplace room of the Alte Amtmannei.
Almost to the day, it has been a year since we held a folk meeting for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln, "says Hanns Moormann, chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I didn't think it was going to happen so quickly in Nottingham.
Whether it was Storm Friederike in January or a heatwave in July, the fireplace room of the office was always full.
"As always, the programme at the next Folktreff is a colourful mix of German folk, hiking and sailor songs, folk songs, evergreens and old hits," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who invites musicians who are friends to Nottuln again and again.
Klaus Spellmeyer has agreed to the first Folktreffen "birthday" with his accordion.
For many years he was a member of "Gaitling," a group from the neighbouring district of Steinfurt, which played music with Low German lyrics.
Now he's on the road with an Irish folk band.
The makers of Folktreff like to remember the last event in the summer, when Christoph Schulz from Folktreff Emsdetten delighted the audience with his international version of the song "Frogs in the Night" and sent them home with a catchy tune.
"We count on many happy guests, in order to spend once again a sociable and humorous evening," it says in the invitation of the homeland association.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to get actively involved is invited to join in.
Since the sought-after seats are always quickly filled, it is advisable to be there early enough.
The Folktreff starts at 19: 30, but admission is already at 19: 00.
China clears proposed merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking another step forward on their way to becoming the world's largest industrial gas group.
The Chinese competition authority has approved the proposed merger, Linde said on Sunday.
This means that the multi-billion dollar merger still has to be approved in South Korea and - as the biggest hurdle - in the US.
According to an insider, the chances of approval there had recently improved because Linde had agreed to sell additional parts of the company.
For legal reasons, all outstanding issues must be resolved by 24 October in order for the merger to succeed.
From pure fruit growing to ecology
The 125-year anniversary of the district association for horticulture and land conservation was celebrated with a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle.
On 29 September 1893 the last founding impulses for the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege Kulmbach were set with a fruit show in the Kulmbach club house, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a big anniversary in the Kulmbach town hall on Saturday evening.
Admittedly, it had a different name at the time: it was founded by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893 as the "District Fruit Building Association Kulmbach Stadt und Land."
The purpose of the fruit-growing association also differed from today's work - in fact, it was purely about fruit-growing, no one thought about flowers and horticulture at that time.
"At that time, in the era of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," explained district home keeper Günter Dippold in his festive lecture.
Fruit trees were to line trunk roads, so-called industrial gardens were created at schools.
The cultivation of fruit is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7000 members.
But that is far from the end of the spectrum.
A natural horticulture, biological plant protection, village beautification and nutrition play just as important a role as the imparting of knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Moles" entertainingly demonstrated on stage how versatile the tasks of a horticultural association are.
"Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said district chairman Günter Reif, and Mayor Henry Schramm also stressed how important experiences in nature are for life.
Collecting chestnuts was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that you can collect as much joy with Smartphone & Co.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with District Administrator Klaus Peter Söllner to mark the anniversary.
"Where they should stand is decided by the district association," added District Administrator Söllner, stressing the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.
The district association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district also left district manager and specialist consultant Friedhelm Haun in no doubt.
He led the many visitors with a picture presentation through the long history of the district association and reported, among other things, on the necessity of self-sufficiency after the war.
Everything used to come from the garden, it was snowed in for the winter.
By the end of the 1950s, however, the kitchen garden had been transformed into an ornamental and residential garden.
"Nature is here to stay, it was there before us and we have to be guided by it," pleaded the expert for fruit and nut trees.
That is why there is an incentive for the horticultural associations not to let up, so that our home remains beautiful and worth living in.
This also includes welcoming the new citizens to our associations, added Wolfram Vaitl, President of the Bavarian State Association.
"We have to stop the blatant decline in insects, we owe it to our children and grandchildren," Günter Reif concluded the successful ceremony, which was solemnly framed by the tower brass of the Thurnau Music Association.

Nafta talks priority: Canada's foreign minister postpones UN speech
Mexico's government wants clarity on Nafta: They are giving both trading partners an ultimatum to reach an agreement.
Canada's foreign minister is now making the trade deal an absolute priority - and postponing her speech to the United Nations.
Due to time constraints in the struggle to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the US and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of this Saturday, the minister will not address the United Nations General Assembly until Monday, her spokesman Adam Austen said.
In the meantime, she said, she is focused on renegotiating Nafta.
Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said Friday that negotiators from Canada and the United States have 48 hours to reach an agreement if Canada really wants to join the trade deal already struck between its country and the United States.
The US and Mexico agreed on a new version of the Nafta regional free trade agreement in August.
US President Donald Trump has hinted that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
Talks on a new edition have been going on for more than a year.
They are now due to be finalised by Sunday evening (local time), with Trump's administration aiming to submit the agreement to the US Senate before October 1.
If negotiations fail, Mexico's president-elect, Andres Manuel López Obrador, announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidate Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in a knife attack, has left hospital.
The far-right ex-military wanted to fly to Rio de Janeiro, where he lives, according to a report in the daily "O Globo."
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will make any public appearances in the South American country in the final week before presidential elections.
The politician was attacked in the street during a campaign rally in southern Brazil in early September.
Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "Der nicht"), women's associations in particular had called for protests against the ex-military.
The associations also mobilized on social networks against Bolsonaro's racist and misogynistic statements.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In the capital Brasilia, the protests mixed with a rally by the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers "Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He took the place of former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who was sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and is therefore not allowed to stand.
Brazil's presidential election is on October 7.
As the ex-mayor of the metropolis of São Paulo, Haddad has been far behind far-right candidate Bolsonaro in polls so far.
The "Trump of Brazil" has been involved in politics for a long time, but now presents himself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates reaches an absolute majority in the first round of voting, there will be a run-off on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge successfully from it - no matter who he runs against.
Bolsonaro is known for inciting against homosexuals and blacks and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Again and again, he shocks with verbal slip-ups.
On another occasion, he said supporters of Lula's left-wing Workers' Party should be shot.
Europe reclaim Ryder Cup title
Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines - Just an hour from Disneyland, European golfers have written another Ryder Cup fairytale just outside Paris.
Captain Thomas Bjorn's underdog team dethroned the favored defending champion USA by a toothless Tiger Woods in front of more than 150,000 spectators over the three days at Le Golf National with great shots and outstanding team spirit.
After a long illness: Danish rock legend has died
Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen said on Larsen's website.
At his deathbed, Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician had been in treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become well-known with the band Gasolin ', which was hugely successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Their songs were influenced by international music greats such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the break-up of the band in 1978 Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold around three million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album "Midt om natten" is still the best-selling album in Denmark.
In a statement on Sunday, Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen paid tribute to Larsen as a "street boy" who was "against everything, but in all hearts."
The prime minister also recalled that Larsen, an opponent of the monarchy, had performed at the 70th birthday of Denmark's Queen Margrethe II in 2010.
Rock night in the shoe factory: volume at jackhammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saw and ignite a concert evening with the power of a tiger." The band names of "Here We Stand," "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" alone suggest such a description of the rocking live music experience on Saturday night in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik: pure hard rock by three bands who are friends with each other.
After the sound check and shortly before the start of the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There was no sign of stage fright.
Afterwards, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in conjunction with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - and their bands loudly inspire the 120 or so visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with front man and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows how to convince at the beginning of the concert evening also with newest, unknown pieces written by themselves and the soon to be released CD.
In front of the stage, the audience dances to the harmonious and powerful interplay of the band.
Although "encore" shouts can't be ignored, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leaves the stage to the trio "Here We Stand."
Guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher demonstrate that hard rock is not the same as hard rock with their alternative sounds, sometimes reminiscent of classic rock of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers," "Here We Stand" also uses a synthesizer in addition to the guitar rock.
Not only the yearning, almost ballad-like "Take Me Home" impresses with the change from melodic passages to the guitar-heavy rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuschen, meanwhile, has gained a special degree of recognition since its foundation in 2005.
Full of agility, the band presents their hard rock on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ignition" has special stage experience with its performances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the tour in China in 2017 - is obvious and unmistakable.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also sets his own accents in collaboration with the band on the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
In the meantime guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a highly acclaimed solo to the sound that feels even higher than before, whereby he runs through the audience.
A certain volume is, of course, part of the genre at such a hard rock concert: at the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, according to the mixing desk team, the three-way concert of "Here We Stand," "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is about 98 decibels.
This is approximately at the level of a pneumatic hammer, but is still significantly below the levels of the "Wacken Fesitval," which "The Ignition" refer to on their website.
Deafening 120 decibels in jet engine volume as usual at the annual Metal rendezvous in the north of the Republic, however, the Ahlen audience does not need this rock night.
After just under four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocking pace have long since convinced with their confident, virtuoso playing and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, have taken the bone saw and ignited a concert evening with the power of a tiger," can all three groups, admittedly in the figurative sense, say at the end.
And above all enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

One dead in glider accident at Essen / Mülheim airport
There has been a fatal accident at Mülheim / Essen Airport.
A glider crashed in a parking lot at Mülheim / Essen Airport on Sunday.
The pilot died in the crash.
There was a fatal accident near the airport of Mülheim / Essen on Sunday.
As the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" reports, a glider had crashed in the trade fair parking lot at the airport.
The pilot was killed, he said.
As the "WAZ" further reports, the flight student was alone on board - the plane is said to be a single-seater.
The plane was already on its approach to land at the time of the accident.
The crash site is just a short distance from a marquee on the airport grounds.
But an Oktoberfest has been taking place since this weekend.
Mülheim / Essen Airport is located on the city limits of the two Ruhr area cities and directly at the entrance to the motorway 52.
From the parking lot there is a Park & Ride offer at large events in the Messe Essen or the Gruga-Halle in Essen.
Trump adores Kim: "And then we fell in love"
It is no secret that the US president is sympathetic to North Korea's leader Kim, despite the nuclear crisis.
Now, however, Trump has made a veritable declaration of love for his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters."
At the tender age of 72, the married US president has confessed to a new flame.
The tragedy is that it is a long-distance relationship.
In public, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday.
In front of supporters in the US state of West Virginia, Trump had almost tender words for the half-old scion of Pyongyang's ruling dynasty, even though he is proving to be quite a tough chunk in the struggle for North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
"I was tough, so was he, and it went back and forth between us," Trump said.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And it wasn't just the talks with Kim that would have melted his heart.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection has also borne political fruit: Trump referred to Kim's announcement of a halt to all nuclear and missile tests, even though critics have so far paid little more than lip service to it.
The US president seemed well aware that the affection for the "Rocket Man" - Trump's nickname for Kim - notorious for his martial threatening gestures might not be to everyone's taste.
In any case, he anticipated the expected criticism when he appeared at a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they fell in love."
How terrible, how terrible is that?
It's so unpresidential.
But he didn't care, Trump said, then pointed his index finger at the crowd: "I've always told you it's so easy to be presidential."
But then there wouldn't be 10,000 people out there cramming into this packed arena, we'd only have 200 people standing outside.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler Best visited, atmospheric and on top of that spoiled by sun: Very varied and with a good shot of Oktoberfest flair, Baesweiler's city centre cleaned itself up on Sunday.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest did not just take place in the marquee at the fire brigade tower, but was extended to the city by the trade association on Sunday.
Refugees rescued from Libyan prison thanks to video
Nigerian refugees have used a mobile phone video to draw attention to their appalling conditions in detention in Libya, enabling them to be rescued.
The group had filmed the footage in their cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July, risking their lives, and shared it online.
"They refuse to send us back," one man said in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the website "France 24 Observers," whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were eventually flown out to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we probably wouldn't have been able to return to Nigeria," Efe Onyeka, who recorded the video, told the AFP news agency.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya while trying to cross the Mediterranean to Europe.
He said he put his life in danger with the video.
One of his comrades was nearly beaten to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
In general, the conditions of detention were disastrous: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organises the voluntary repatriation of refugees stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria have been sent back home through the program this year, said Jorge Galindo, an IOM spokesman in the West African country.
The case of the Nigerians who have now been rescued is not exceptional in view of the poor prison conditions in Libya.
But he said he had not yet heard of a call for help via cell phone video.
International organisations have long criticised the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps as inhumane.
The North African state, which is largely dominated by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on their way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the elementary school on Sunday afternoon to prepare her class for Monday, she surprised a burglar.
At about 4: 50 p.m., the teacher entered the building through the main entrance.
In the front building of the first floor, she saw a man who immediately fled.
First through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there via a staircase to the ground floor or the forecourt.
The teacher notified the police, who have launched an investigation.
It is not yet possible to say whether items or money were stolen.
Description of the perpetrator: about 16 years old, black, very short hair, slightly darker appearance, dark trousers, dark t-shirt.
Please refer to the police inspection Obernberg am Inn, telephone number 059 133 4244.
German man was trapped in his own car for days
A 75-year-old man had to stay in his car for several days and nights in a wooded area in central Franconia after he got the car stuck off all forest roads and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescue workers discovered the car by chance near a pasture on Saturday afternoon and freed the man, who had been missing since Tuesday evening, police said on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was said to be in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He said he was now looking forward to his home.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after failing to return from a drive in his SUV across the local meadows and fields on Tuesday.
Despite intensive search efforts, the man's whereabouts had remained unclear for days.
Laschet calls for rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) has called for the rule of law in Turkey in talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to his own statement.
Relations between the two countries are currently "overshadowed," Laschet said on Saturday after meeting Erdogan at Cologne airport.
This concerns in particular waves of arrests, freedom of the press and freedom of religion.
He had therefore "made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalise in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this."
According to Laschet, he also addressed the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey.
He had expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan then again stressed the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan was moved at short notice to a building of the Federal Ministry of Defence's flight readiness at Cologne airport.
Originally it was supposed to take place at Schloss Wahn - but the owners of the castle had refused to do so out of political conviction against Erdogan.
After the talks, Erdogan travelled on to the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said: "The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their point of contact - and not the Turkish President.
Lack of trust in US: North Korea makes demand for disarmament
While US President Trump never tires of emphasizing the successes of negotiations on North Korea's denuclearization, the East Asian regime presents a more sober picture.
Foreign Minister Ri is calling for a concession from Washington.
At the UN General Debate, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho accused the US government of using its continued sanctions to block negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
"The recent stalemate comes as the United States is relying on coercive measures that are lethal to confidence-building," Ri said in New York.
Under these circumstances, disarmament would be unthinkable for North Korea.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances, there is no way that we will be the first to disarm ourselves," the North Korean chief diplomat said.
That punitive measures could "bring North Korea to its knees" is "a pipe dream of people who don't know us."
To build trust, however, his country halted its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test site, Ri said.
However, there has been no "corresponding reaction" from the US side, the minister criticised.
Because of North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, the UN Security Council adopted sanctions against the internationally isolated country three times last year alone.
US President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have been pushing for strict compliance with the sanctions at the United Nations in recent days.
At the same time, the US government is working on rapprochement.
In June, Trump met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for the first time.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US president is seeking a second summit with Kim.
Pompeo is scheduled to return to Pyongyang in October for talks on ending North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the community
The fact that they were actually in a youth meeting place was not noticed by the many visitors to the HoT open house: white blankets and floral arrangements on the tables and a large buffet were waiting for the guests after the Thanksgiving service.
The young people of the HoT had conjured up the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to say thank you with the food.
The start with the new facility was not exactly easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, remembers.
We had already filled our fridges with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then on the first day after the summer break came the nasty surprise: A power failure had put the huge, two-part fridge out of operation, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start all over again: We got a lot of support from friends and neighbours, but the children and young people wanted to do it on their own," says Westbuer.
And so everyone got involved.
The result was impressive, the guests were enthusiastic.
"Chefs can't do better either," praised one impressed visitor, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were allowed to help themselves to quiche, liver cheese or cake.
"It is really great what the children and young people have put on their feet," emphasised Father Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen caused astonishment with card tricks and other tricks.
Jürgen Sator leaves the NRW regional board of the Tafel
Out of frustration over criticism from his own ranks, the head of the Essen Tafel, Jörg Sartor, has left his post in the regional association.
Sartor had become well-known throughout Germany because the Essen Tafel had introduced an admission stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned as deputy head of the NRW tablets in July, Sartor told "Welt am Sonntag."
There have been too many in my back.
The head of the Tafeln-Landesverband NRW, Wolfgang Weilerswist, told dpa that he was sympathetic to the decision of his long-time deputy.
Sartor took the sharp criticism with him.
"I can understand his move - there were people who didn't know exactly why the Essen Tafel was doing this."
Sartor, however, is still active for the Essen Tafel - "six days a week, nothing changes," says Weilerswist.
Sartor again criticized colleagues from other panels in the "Welt am Sonntag."
One should not take the approach that "without us, the people in the city are starving."
It was the task of the state to ensure that people did not starve to death.
The Essen man did not take part in a congress of the boards on Friday in Berlin.
"There's too much sweet stuff being told to me," he said.
There are all these social fuzzis who were so critical of me back then.
SF Lorch lose 2-0 lead - Gmünder Daily Mail
Football, Lorch loses to newcomers 2: 3 - TV Heuchlingen wins in Kirchheim after falling behind - Bettringen beats Lauchheim clear.
With 2: 0 Lorch was already in the lead in the home game against the TV newcomer - in the end it was 2: 3 and the disappointment among the sports fans was great.
Completely different of the TV hypocrites: In Kirchheim the TVH quickly fell behind with 0: 1, but won after 90 minutes with 2: 1. At the top of the table the SGB could meanwhile with a 3: 0
Gladbach squander two-goal lead - Schalke without Embolo with first win
Borussia Monchengladbach must continue to wait for an away win at Wolfsburg.
At 2-2, the Foals squander a two-run lead.
Schalke get their first win of the season against Mainz (1-0).
(sda) Schalke have been offside four times in their first five league games with early goals.
Now Domenico Tedesco's team once again showed the strength with which they finished in first place behind Bayern last season.
Alessandro Schöpf headed the home side into the lead in the eleventh minute after strong work by Yevgeny Konoplyanka, and the hosts then preserved the mini-cushion with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback Borussia Dortmund greets again from the top of the Bundesliga.
Lucien Favre's team had racked up a 0-2 deficit against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but came back to win 4-2 in the second half.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65.) and Marco Reus (69.) equalised with a double within four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63rd minute, provided the crowning conclusion of the performance increase after the break with another double in the closing stages (86. / 94.).
VfB Stuttgart also won for the first time.
Against Werder Bremen, who had already been decimated before the break due to a yellow and red card against Milos Veljkovic, Stuttgart had to worry in the meantime.
Borna Sosa and inattentive goalkeeper Ron-Robert Zieler produced a curious throw-in own goal that helped the visitors equalise in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later Gonzalo Castro led VfB to their first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a completely successful, but also not a failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The team from Gladbach with the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang twice gave up a lead, finally played 2: 2 and are still waiting for an away win in the VW city since 2003.
Renato Steffen was responsible for Wolfsburg's equaliser in the 1-1 draw with his second Bundesliga goal.
Yann Sommer was powerless with a low shot from 20 yards, just as he was with his second goal after an hour.
Nevertheless, the trends at Gladbach are quite promising.
Alassane Pléa turns out to be a goalgetter in the storm of the foals.
Against Wolfsburg, the French record purchase, who came from OGC Nice, scored for the third time in a row and for the seventh time in the seventh game.
Gladbach finished in 4th place after seven rounds.
Within 40 minutes, the previously unbeaten Werder Bremen manoeuvred themselves into an uncomfortable position against VfB Stuttgart.
After 19 minutes Florian Kohlfeldt's team let themselves be surprised by a Stuttgart counter-attack, which ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis completed with his first goal of the season. After 36 minutes Milos Veljkovic added to his team: The 23-year-old Serb received a yellow-red after a jersey tug against Daniel Didavi.
Although Stuttgart defender Borna Sosa and goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought Bremen back into the game with a curious throw-in own goal (68th), a quarter of an hour before the end Gonzalo Castro shot the outnumbered Stuttgart back on the road to victory.
Nuremberg won the duel against Düsseldorf 3: 0.
After half an hour Hanno Behrens put the home team on course with a foul penalty.
Macedonians to vote on new state name
In Macedonia, around 1.8 million citizens are voting today on whether to change their country's name to Northern Macedonia.
A "yes" vote could resolve nearly three decades of simmering conflict with neighbor Greece.
Athens had insisted on a name change because of its northern province of the same name and had blocked any rapprochement between Macedonia and the West.
The voters therefore also decide on the future integration of the West.
The US had announced that, if the referendum was positive, the country could quickly become a member of NATO.
Syrians in custody.
Refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian brutally beat up three pensioners, some of whom were seriously injured.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker had rioted in the escape alley in Alsergrund at around 10pm on Friday.
When the police arrived, they spoke to the suspect about his behaviour, who ran at passers-by with clenched fists and tried to attack them.
The Syrian then tried to punch and kick the officers.
A short time later it turned out that the suspect had beaten three elderly ladies (65, 67, 75) to the ground with his fists at a tram stop in Währinger Straße.
He had also kicked the trio with his feet.
Some of the pensioners were seriously injured.
They suffered hematomas, bruises and concussions.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured "for an as yet unknown cause," police said.
He was taken to hospital and monitored throughout the treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of marriage for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs has married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two exchanged vows in Hamburg on Saturday.
A registered civil partnership was out of the question for her, Kahrs had previously told the Bild newspaper.
"If we get married, that's right." He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the budget spokesman for the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokesmen for the Seeheim district, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs caused a stir with an angry speech on 30 June 2017.
He had accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of "stumbling" on the issue.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said, alluding to Günter Schabowski's accidental announcement of the opening of the GDR border.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples have been able to marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their civil partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as the right to adopt.
Garden day: 400 metres of hedge cut
There was a lot of work in front of the members of the civic association Children's Home and the Society for Leprosy.
This is because around 400 metres of hedge around the gardens of the residents of the Pfründnerhaus were to be cut.
Supported by the residents, it went to work for about twelve supporters.
"We are doing this in order to reduce costs," said Walter Schröer, chairman of the citizens "association.
And a lot of things have accumulated.
Due to the hot summer we are late this time, but fortunately it is now only a shape cut.
Because the hedge had already been shorn once in the spring.
Breakfast, which always follows work, also has a long tradition.
"Everyone should stick to their guns," said Walter Schröer.
World Championships in Rio: Hannes Aigner wins gold at the Canoe Slalom World Championships
Hannes Aigner from Augsburg has won the gold medal at the end of the Canoe Slalom World Championships in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old put in a perfect run on the Olympic track on Sunday.
Two years ago, he missed out on Olympic bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well prepared, I've had enough rides here on the track and it all worked out today, "said the London 2012 Olympic bronze medallist.
At the finish, he threw away his paddle for joy and raised both arms in victory - knowing that it would be enough for at least one medal.
After all, he had race number four.
But the six remaining starters could not top his fabulous time of 89.69 seconds.
The Czech Jiri Prskavec finished second ahead of the Russian Pawel Eigel.
The Gauting Police Department reports the first attempted break-in of a single-family home this fall.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - burglars want to take advantage of that again.
Yesterday, the Gauting Police Inspectorate reported the first break-in attempt this autumn.
The fact that it remained with the attempt at the single-family house on the Königswieser road, is thanks to the alarm system.
It started when the perpetrators shook hands shortly before 8pm on Friday.
The burglars did suspect that the residents were not at home.
However, the alarm system apparently surprised them so much that they fled without prey.
Information to the PI Gauting, telephone (089) 8 93 13 30.
Hertha bust: caught up with reality as Bayern take on Ajax
The predicate of unbeatable is gone: the FC Bayern does not want to put up with the defeat in Berlin.
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach will now determine the first interim result of Niko Kovac's tenure.
The first small dip in performance under new coach Niko Kovac should not be a major autumn low for the Munich-based side.
"A week ago, people still had the impression that we were invincible.
Now a bit of reality has caught up with us, "stated Thomas Müller after the deserved 0-2 defeat at Hertha BSC and demanded a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us knows that this really annoys us and that is why we are stepping on the gas towards Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year no own goal was scored away from home, as at the same time of the pre-season two obligatory games in a row without a win, lost the league lead in the Bundesliga to Borussia Dortmund for the time being.
Although the overall situation is nowhere near as dramatic as it was at the end of the failed Carlo Ancelotti era at the end of September 2017, the record signing still has to be warned.
The FC Augsburg at 1: 1 with its running-intensive man-against-man tactics and the Berliners with their playful pinpricks over the outside have delivered two blueprints within three days, how the recently overpowering Bavarians can be cracked after all.
"Those who know FC Bayern know that we will not put up with this and we will do everything we can to be successful again," stressed Kovac.
Apart from that, however, he was surprisingly gentle with his losers in his hometown and blamed his first defeat as Munich coach only on another poor handling of chances.
A win against Amsterdam and against Borussia Monchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless make the first interim result of his tenure positive before the international break - otherwise the tone is likely to get worse.
Kovac did not take any extraordinary measures ahead of his second Premier League appearance of the season after the 2-0 defeat at Benfica Lisbon.
After the day off on Sunday, the short preparation begins as planned for the second preliminary round match against Ajax, who also beat AEK Athens 3-0 in their opener.
"Now it has caught us in two games, but we will score again," announced national team captain Manuel Neuer.
As was the case after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt at the same place, Joshua Kimmich in particular spoke clearly.
The lawyer acted in the role of admonisher.
"I don't think it's all bad luck, we have to work it out again because we don't make the many chances and make the mistakes at the back," stressed the 23-year-old shortly before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On matchday seven of last season, Bayern were already five points behind Dortmund, who have now taken the lead again with a one-point advantage.
And so Kimmich, with a twinkle in his eye, at least took a positive view that the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bayern has now come to an end.
"Yeah, that's a good thing," the international said.
It's good for the league.
DFB boss in line of fire: Özil-Causa: Sharp attack by Erdogan on Grindel
With serious accusations, Turkish President Erdogan denounces the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB president Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the FA line.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought on different stages for the sovereignty of interpretation in the long-running dispute over Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish President strongly criticised the treatment of the former world champion in Germany at the opening of the large Ditib Mosque in Cologne, the DFB chief defended the FA line.
In the early hours of Sunday morning, Grindel, who was personally attacked by Özil, announced the consequences of the cause in Mainz's ZDF "sports studio."
"In the future - because we also have a lot of players with a migrant background in the U-teams - we have to draw very precise conclusions that something like this will not happen again," said the 57-year-old and wants to recruit an international without a migrant background as another integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel reiterated that Erdogan does not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
He had strongly denounced racism towards Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our Mesut Özil, who was born and raised in Germany, and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this society because they allowed themselves to be photographed with me in England, "Erdogan said Saturday in the cathedral city.
To be honest, as their president, I could not digest the fact that our two young men, who have risen to the top of the German national team, were marginalised.
Grindel pointed to Gündogan's statement that, in contrast to Özil, he felt "sensibly treated by the DFB" after the World Cup affair, which began with photos of the two of them with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced his intention to stand in front of players in the future.
For someone to say: If I win, I am German, if I lose, I am a migrant - that is not possible.
"I very much regret that he has such an impression," Grindel said.
We should have defended Mesut more, I've always said that.
But he also does not see a basis for Özil's return to the national team.
As a consequence, in addition to Brazilian-born Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon, an additional integration officer is now to be appointed.
"If someone without a migrant background has a clear impact on society and football and says," The issue is important, we have to take care of it, "that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground, where integration has to work," Grindel said.
Despite the criticism of himself after the World Cup exit and the Özil affair, he intends to run for president of the DFB again next year.
"I'm doing my job and trying to do it as well as I can," Grindel said.
Year-old builds three accidents in three hours
Coburg / Rödental - Police say the 75-year-old caused the accidents between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. on Friday.
At first, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red light in the Lauterer Höhe area.
She told the pensioner that he had hit her car.
There was no exchange of personnel, however, as the 75-year-old could no longer find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, the police received a telephone message about a motorist who had veered off the road and hit a guard post.
Asked about it, the man did not want police on the scene and then drove away.
After that, the Rödentaler drove home.
However, the pensioner got lost in his home, where he has lived for decades, and rammed a construction vehicle while turning.
Eventually the police were able to find him and stop him.
His car was clearly damaged in the accident.
The 75-year-old made a confused impression and could not remember many things.
The damage amounts to approximately 1300 euros.
Moor fire in Meppen: Nearly 1000 firefighters are still in action.
About four weeks after the outbreak of the bog fire on a Bundeswehr site in Emsland, 980 firefighters are still working on the extinguishing work.
This was announced by the Bundeswehr on Sunday.
As the situation continues to be stable, according to a spokesman, 70 volunteers have recently been withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of forces is planned, it says.
On Sunday night, an above-ground fire had been discovered and extinguished.
Last week, the disaster, which had been declared just over a week earlier on 21 September, was lifted because of fears that the flames were putting neighbouring forests and settlements at risk due to wind and flying sparks.
Thursday, it said the fire was no longer threatening to spread to neighboring communities.
At times, more than 1,500 firefighters tried to get the blaze under control on the ground.
The Air Force continues to support the work at the Bundeswehr test site near Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with Bundeswehr drones.
According to the Bundeswehr, reconnaissance flights with "Tornados" are also planned for 2 and 5 October.
The fire was caused by test missiles fired by Airbus technicians.
The plume of smoke from the bog fire had at times travelled up to a hundred kilometres across the north-west of Germany as far as Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr plans to set up a contact point to receive damage reports.
Initial claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Katharinen in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, the politician married his long-time friend in Hamburg.
The two have been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of marriage for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs has married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two exchanged vows in Hamburg on Saturday.
A registered civil partnership was out of the question for her, Kahrs had previously told the Bild newspaper.
If we get married, that's right.
He said he had been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the budget spokesman for the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokesmen for the Seeheim district, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs caused a stir with an angry speech on 30 June 2017.
He had accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of "stumbling" on the issue.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said, alluding to Günter Schabowski's accidental announcement of the opening of the GDR border.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples have been able to marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their civil partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as the right to adopt.
Referendum begins in Macedonia on new state name
In Macedonia, the much-anticipated referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Some 1.8 million voters are to decide whether their state should be called Northern Macedonia in the future.
Its neighbour Greece insists on this because of its northern province of the same name.
As a means of exerting pressure, Athens had blocked any rapprochement between Skopje and the EU and NATO for almost three decades.
If the citizens vote "yes," they will also be giving the go-ahead for their country's Western integration.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saves the Shoah from oblivion
Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel would have turned 90 on September 30.
The 1986 Nobel Peace Prize winner died in the United States in 2016, leaving behind a body of work that preserves the horror of the Shoah for posterity.
Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve family members in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may continue to be removed only with explicit consent, stresses Swisstransplant.
(AP) Switzerland is launching an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This should make organ donation easier and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
People who wish to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes can then be called up by Swisstransplant if necessary.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may continue to be removed - as in Germany - only with explicit consent, stresses Swisstransplant.
It is assumed that 15 percent of Swiss people have a donor card, says Franz Immer, director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only in five per cent of cases would a card be found at the crucial moment with potential donors.
In more than 60 per cent of conversations, relatives do not know the wishes of the deceased.
"They then have to decide on behalf of the deceased, which is often very stressful," Immer said.
A similar registration system already exists in the UK.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information on possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokeswoman of the Federal Agency for Health Education, Marita Völker-Albert, says.
"There is no register where people can register their wishes - for or against organ donation," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has spoken out in favour of a new regulation of organ donation.
Under his proposal, anyone would initially be considered an organ donor, unless they or relatives object.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is world champion in mental arithmetic
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is world champion in mental arithmetic.
He beat 39 competitors in Wolfsburg at the weekend.
Martina Flamme-Jasper from the Phaeno Science Museum, the venue of the competition, announced the news on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany took third place.
The youngest participant in the World Cup was a 12-year-old Japanese schoolboy, the oldest a 74-year-old pensioner from France, chief referee Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organises the competition every two years.
Previous tasks were for example: 14,130 214 x 17,981,822 or 57,809,355 + 28 x 16,448,333.
Since spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, in which participants competed against guests from the audience with calculators.
Wenzel Grüß from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air while doing arithmetic.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Grüß was already there two years ago as a 14-year-old in Bielefeld.
With terms like "super brain," "genius" or "prodigy," Laue can do little.
"Mental arithmetic can be trained," he said.
Many participants practised for several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even stadium-based computing competitions.
The disciplines include, for example, square root drawing from six-digit numbers.
In versatility computing, candidates are given surprise tasks for which they must quickly find a solution strategy.
The Germans have a good chance here, too, said the chief referee.
Otherwise, Asians are often at an advantage, because mental arithmetic is learned more intensively and with other, effective methods already in early childhood.
Urgent appeal: Video featuring naked Serena Williams: It's all about breast cancer screening
Tennis ace Serena Williams shows off her emotional and sensitive side.
The 37-year-old wants to use this video to raise awareness of breast cancer and advocate for early detection.
It is a matter of life and death, but also of courage and education.
Serena Williams sings topless the song "I Touch Myself" by the group "The Divinyls" - only her hands cover her most intimate parts.
Singer Chrissy Amphlett has died from the disease.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project, which is about breast cancer screening that can save lives.
Serena Williams nearly died herself a year ago.
There were complications with the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia.
Emergency surgery was launched to save the baby's life.
A subsequent CT scan then revealed blood clots in Serena's lungs.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The Federal Government is planning a significant extension of the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the turquoise-blue coalition will send a corresponding bill to the so-called "symbols law" for review.
The aim is to significantly expand the number of terrorist or similar groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings fresh snow to the mountains in the west
Next week, Ms Holle will shake out her beds for the first time in the West: Polar cold air will reach Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit drops to 1,500 to 1,200 metres at the beginning of the week - in narrow valleys it can snow down to about 1,000 metres at high intensity, it was said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern, 20 to 40 centimetres of fresh snow is to be expected above 2,000 metres.
On higher mountain pass roads (Arlberg Pass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brenner Pass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Grossglockner High Alpine Road), the road conditions therefore become wintry.
Farmers will be allowed to start annual kink maintenance on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers will be allowed to start their annual kink care on Monday.
The "green ramparts," which are unique in Germany, have shaped the landscape of the forest-poor federal state for around 200 years.
The tree and undergrowth hedges, which are up to five metres wide, are a "forest substitute" and the last refuge for many animals and plants.
Knicks connect scattered habitats as corridors through which the exchange of organisms can still function, as Ingo Ludwichowski, managing director of the German Nature Conservation Union (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, said.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were founded on an order of the Danish King Christian VI in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field boundaries and cattle fences, they also supplied the farmers with firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.
His name "Knick" also dates from that time: by "bending" the branches, the dense, intertwined demarcations were able to develop.
Today, some 45,000 kilometres of hedges stretch between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, giving the impression of a woody, variously structured landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used as a substitute habitat by around 7,000 animal species.
Up to 1800 different species could live in one kilometre of bend and breed up to 30 pairs of birds.
However, the kink can only fulfil its ecologically important function if it is properly maintained in winter.
Otherwise, it atrophies to a light row of trees, which, in addition to biodiversity, also loses the wind protection effect, Ludwichowski said.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, buckling care can only be carried out outside the breeding season from October to March.
After Sulawesi tsunami, Indonesian man talks about sighting on the ground
In an interview with the RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND), local resident Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquake and tsunami:
Have you been there yourself during the tsunami?
No, I was in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I found out about the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
I arrived there on Sunday morning, because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, because the airport on Palu was closed at that time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that relief supplies can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, which are all completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" is also destroyed, but we have provisionally set up something where we have also accommodated other people.
Where are the people living in Sulawesi now?
Many have run to surrounding hills, where they are still holding out for fear of another tsunami and earthquake, and where they have no access to water or food.
Some are in front of their homes, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and gas stations are completely closed, people sometimes steal food and gasoline.
The public service has been completely shut down, the national government is helping out.
A prison has also been destroyed, some of the prisoners are walking around freely and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies lying around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How does communication and information supply work on the island?
At the moment we have mobile phone reception, but before that it did not work and we only got information over the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbours and other people who they do not know if they live or where they are, because people were not at home during the earthquakes, but at work, for example.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have any information?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the all-clear came, many thought, "Okay, no tsunami" - and then it came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was the misinformation that a tsunami was hitting the region and they ran to the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi, located on the Pacific Ring of Fire, not prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this one was the worst.
We usually know how to respond to earthquakes, and we also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.
Muscle injuries against Werder: VfB have to do without Aogo and Donis for a long time
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will miss VfB Stuttgart for an extended period of time with serious muscle injuries.
Aogo suffered a torn muscle in the back of his left thigh in the 2-1 win over Werder Bremen on Saturday, the Bundesliga club announced on Sunday.
Doctors diagnosed Donis with a torn muscle in his thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably still miss games after the following international break.
VfB Stuttgart did not give a forecast for the downtime.
A muscle bundle tear usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fiber tear usually heals a little faster.
Triumph of Hyperrealism at the San Sebástian Film Festival
San Sebastián - The San Sebastián Film Festival brings to an end the annual round of the most prestigious European festivals.
Despite all the farewells to cinema, 2018 has been a remarkable year for the film.
After a convincing competition in Cannes, especially with strong entries from Europe and Asia, and a Venice that attracted a lot of attention with Oscar candidates from Hollywood, San Sebastian also delivered one of its best competitions in recent years.
On Sunday morning, the Olching Fire Department tried to catch an injured duck.
The action, however, dragged on for some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - Walkers at Lake Olching noticed a white, injured duck on Sunday morning.
She was in the area of the water watch station.
To help the animal, passers-by called the police and fire brigade.
The first attempts to catch the duck, however, went wrong.
Despite the injury, she was able to avoid the emergency services time and again.
In the end, she fled to the lake.
With a lifeboat, the fire brigade was able to encircle the animal and push it back to shore, where it was then put into a transport box by a firefighter with a bold handle after almost an hour.
The duck, injured in the chest, was then taken to the veterinary clinic of the LMU in Oberschleissheim.
But according to initial assessments, their chances of survival are rather slim.
Biathlete Julian Eberhard aiming for World Championship medal
Fourth place at the Olympics was long in the stomach for biathlete Julian Eberhard.
Next winter, the man from Saalfelden wants to make up for the missed precious metal at the World Championships in Östersund.
The 31-year-old's final shot cost him a medal within touching distance in the Pyeongchang Olympic sprint.
Seven-tenths of a second down on bronze in the end.
"I deliberately took my time to process this," Eberhard says at the opening of the MyGym gym in his hometown of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top form, but it just wasn't to be.
The Pinzgauer is all the more motivated to make up for the missed precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to come back to a major event with the constitution, to win something.
At some point you have to strike.
The World Cup track in Östersund (SWE) is in Eberhard's hands: "I have already taken the track to my heart," he remembers with joy his fourth World Cup place in the individual race last year.
Immediately after the Olympics, he celebrated the only individual victory for Austria in the mass start competition of Kontiolahti (FIN) in the last World Cup winter.
He finished second in the relay in Oslo (NOR).
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation at turbo pace
Time is extremely short and the number of scheduled interrogations is severely limited.
With an FBI investigation underway, Republicans in the US Senate want to secure a razor-thin majority for controversial Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on charges of coercion.
President Donald Trump has given investigators until Friday to investigate the alleged incidents, which date back more than 30 years.
The latest twist in the drama surrounding Kavanaugh's appointment, which has been accompanied by a culture war, was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing between Kavanaugh and first accuser Christine Blasey Ford, during which the lawyer launched angry tirades against opposition Democrats, the Senate Judiciary Committee was supposed to clear the way for the final confirmation of the arch-conservative judge to the US Supreme Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed assured when, contrary to his initial announcement, Senator Jeff Flake suddenly declared that he would vote yes, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his fellow party members agreed.
President Trump, who on Thursday referred to the serious allegations as "shit," initially refrained from further attacks on the women, instead calling them "bad luck."
That way, final doubts could be dispelled, he said.
Later, at a campaign rally, Trump sharply attacked Democrats for opposing Kavanaugh: "They're trying to block and destroy."
Trump orders FBI investigation into Kavanaugh case
The White House has also severely limited the powers of investigators.
"They're not going on a fishing trip," a government official told the Wall Street Journal, referring to the well-known allegations by two women.
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses will be heard.
The mobile radar system installed in a "civilian vehicle" by the municipality of Ried to monitor the speed limit will be stationed on Gartenstraße from Monday, 1 October, according to the municipality.
This is also where the Federal School Centre is located.
The municipality also operates several fixed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: You could feel the fear
Coach Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first win of the season against Mainz.
There is great relief at Schalke after their first win of the season.
Against Mainz, however, the time factor also played a role.
Gelsenkirchen - By now it is well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches.
It was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
'I've seen every ball in there.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penalty area, "said the sports director of Schalke 04 - and breathed a sigh of relief.
In the end, the royal blue managed to secure the narrow 1: 0 against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first victory of the season.
In fact, things could have been different.
After the lead by Alessandro Schöpf 11th had given the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco security Tedesco: "Overall, the first half was good, both in terms of play and in terms of pressing.," the head obviously played more and more a role as the game went on.
Don't really create a header monster
"The last ten minutes felt like two hours for me," Heidel said. "If the team was half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to let this get out of their hands and therefore withdrew further and further.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three points of the season.
"We all fell a huge stone from our hearts," said Schöpf, who had no small part in this with his header goal: "I am actually the worst header player in the team."
But in the end, only victory counts.
The relief was palpable throughout the arena, including Tedesco, of course.
"We wanted to start strongly in the early stages and make fireworks out of it," Schalke's head coach said.
The win was important.
Finally we can look forward to a few hours.
I'm very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We played intelligently, calmly and courageously, so we have to approach games over 90 minutes
Probably the biggest flaw of the afternoon: Royal Blue missed out on making for clearer conditions.
The opportunities were finally there, such as the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who hit the crossbar twice, or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have been a shock win," Tedesco said: "You could feel the fear a little bit."
So I'm glad we won.
So he was not the only Schalke player.
Fischbachau: Smoke column in the Leitzachtal 2 km visible
The smoke could not be overlooked.
A hiker in the Leitzach Valley observed a fire about 1.30pm on Sunday from a distance of about two kilometres.
Police are now investigating.
Fischbachau - The police and fire brigade soon found out the cause: An unknown person had set fire to garbage on a two-square-metre area on Gschwendner Berg.
According to police, it appeared he had been monitoring the fire for some time, but then left the embers unattended.
And this close to the forest.
30 Fischbach firefighters were busy pulling apart and extinguishing the fire.
Police are now investigating for arson.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion at eye level
In front of them stands the author, Professor Doctor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has once again accepted the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have made it my mission to bring interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treffs" - the association that cooperates with the "Kulturpolitik" alliance in organising the evening.
El-Mafaalani goes into the reading very relaxed, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the topic in an understandable way.
With a lot of gestures, solid figures and the odd joke, he brings the audience closer to one of the most conflict-ridden topics: migration and integration.
Why do conflicts arise more and more despite successful integration?
The Syrian-born author uses a metaphor to answer the question.
At one table sits German society, at the cat table the migrants of the first generation.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to come to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to have a say.
This leads to conflicts.
The decisive factor is therefore not whether one classifies oneself politically to the right or to the left, but: "Am I for or against an open society?," he stresses.
At first rather subdued, then the discussion gets off to an increasingly lively start.
And there is a need to speak.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani is standing in front, not on stage, a symbol of the discussion: she is on an equal footing.
The sociology professor does not impose his opinion, stresses that he is talking about the average, not about individual fates.
He is pleased that there is interest in the issue because "it is only when we understand what the problem is that we can find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
During the subsequent signing session, he still had an open ear for the questions of the guests and there was also intensive further discussion in the foyer with prepared Kurdish specialities.
Basketball: Bonn and Gießen win opening matches
The Giessen 46ers and the Telekom Baskets Bonn have finished the first day of the Basketball Bundesliga (BBL) with a home and an away win.
Gießen prevailed in a hard-fought match in its own hall with 91: 84 (43: 46) against the Central German BC.
The ambitious Bonner won at the BG Göttingen with 86: 79 (49: 47).
The first league leader of the season is Alba Berlin after the 112: 55 Gala on Saturday against Science City Jena.
At the beginning of the new season, the German champions Bayern Munich and the former series champion Brose Bamberg had much more trouble.
Munich already struggled to an 83: 77 at ratiopharm Ulm on Friday, Bamberg won the Frankenderby at s.Oliver Würzburg on Saturday with 84: 80.
Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The need is obviously huge: Over 100 prospective buyers have applied for the purchase of one of the properties in Landsham South.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first plots of land in the new development area Landsham-Süd on the open market.
This is what Mayor Roland Frick tells us.
In addition, the application phase for the 20 plots offered by the municipality at more favourable conditions or prices - similar to the former local model - has been completed.
A good 100 applications have been received, according to Frick.
"The documents are currently being examined," with regard to the application criteria, completeness and accuracy.
According to the mayor of Pliingen, the aim is to have drawn up the list of applicants for the 20 plots by the end of the year and to submit them to the local council.
After that, the award could take place.
A total of 50 plots for single and semi-detached houses will be created on the site in the south of Landsham, as well as four plots for multi-family houses, each of which is expected to have eight residential units.
The development is now almost complete, and the roads and paths are to be paved soon.
A single plot as well as two of the apartment buildings belong to a private individual, the rest to the municipality of Pliening.
It sells the majority on the open market, 20 plots in a socially acceptable model.
According to Frick, the two apartment buildings in the community are to be built as affordable housing.
With a total of 16 income-oriented apartments supported by the Free State.
Space for 200 people
It is roughly estimated that housing for around 200 people will be created on the site of the new Landsham South development.
Not only that: now, at the beginning of October, according to Frick, the start of the construction of a new day care center will take place there.
It will house three kindergarten and three nursery groups, as well as a multi-purpose room.
It is scheduled to open in September 2019, at the start of the next kindergarten year.
Schalke's Naldo is' great sport 'even on the bench
Not in the starting line-up for the third time in a row: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had not been in the Schalke starting line-up for the third time in a row, but had sat on the substitutes "bench, the understanding of many people would have been great if the almost two-metre tall Brazilian had let his frustration get the better of him.
But when the Schalke players gathered as usual in the centre circle after the 1-0 victory over FSV Mainz 05 and head coach Domenico Tedesco thanked all his professionals, the 36-year-old, who everyone calls Naldo for the sake of simplicity, stepped in and said: "We have to thank you, coach!"
"It was very emotional, it was great sport," Tedesco later said of the reaction of his vice-captain, who held no grudges despite being a reserve again.
Probably Naldo, who was celebrated as the best Schalke player last season, knows that he is actually not on the sidelines with his coach - but gets a break for good reason.
One reason is called "stress management."
It wasn't easy to tell him that.
"It wasn't easy to tell him that, I'll be honest with you," Tedesco said of the moment he told Naldo he wasn't in the starting line-up.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the cause, it's about the club, "Tedesco said of the move.
Naldo played 90 minutes against Bayern and Porto.
He is 36 years old.
It is important that everyone can take a breather at the moment.
And that we keep everybody in the boat, "Tedesco said of the rotation, which has also caught Naldo recently.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by proving himself an exemplary team player even on the bench.
The mood in Austria's industry accelerated its decline compared to the eurozone in August.
The purchasing managers "index (PMI) was at a 37-month low of 46.7 points.
Across Europe, Austria still has the third-best sentiment behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute said on Monday in its survey of 3,000 companies.
In contrast to Austria, the PMI for the euro zone rose by 1.1 points to 45.1, but the index is still below the 50-point mark indicating growth for the 13th month in a row.
Only Ireland's industry broke that threshold in August, with 50.9 points.
At the bottom were the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the sentiment barometer fell, but at a slower pace than in previous months.
In Spain, the index reached 44.0 points, its highest level since March.
"The slightly weakened dip may mean the worst is over," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
But industry - in the third quarter at least - remains the number one drag on growth.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the eurozone fell at their fastest rate since November 2011.
Companies cut jobs for the seventh month in a row.
Industrial production in China also fell more sharply in August than initially thought.
The sentiment barometer fell to 47.6 points from 49.3 points in the previous month.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The Purchasing Managers Index bases its figures on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
It covers, among other things, developments in turnover, employment, warehouses and prices.
Tuchel's PSG team secure eighth win in eight league games
September 29, 2018 at 7: 45 PM
Nice coach Thomas Tuchel is rushing from victory to victory with Paris Saint-Germain in France's football championship.
At the OGC Nice, the defending champion won 3-0 (1-0) thanks to two goals from superstar Neymar and was also successful in his eighth league game.
The last time Olympique Lyon made such a good start to the season in France was 82 years ago.
Brazilian Neymar gave PSG the lead after 22 minutes and set up the final score in injury time.
Christopher Nkunku (46th) made it 2-0 at the interval.
It also provided Paris with a dress rehearsal for their landmark second Champions League group game against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
Tuchel's team suffered their only defeat in the Premier League so far this season in the 2-3 draw at Liverpool.
