In The United States we are now attacking abortion justice - a powerful documentary tells us why
The US Senate is currently trying to determine whether one of the nine members of the supreme court is to choose the candidate Brett Kavanaugh Set by President Donald Trump.
In the Republican party, many people wish that kavanaugh's decisive voice would be able to overturn the decision known to the roe vs. Wade, which made the eu abortion legal in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg documentary irreversible - usa and abortion rights tell us how the current situation has been coming up over the years.
As incredible as it feels, the subject is also current in Finland.
The Minister of foreign affairs TIMO SO (in) has done a publicity job against a safe abortion and has received different degrees of support for the power of the country.
At the beginning of the documentary documentary, the gynecologist Colleen Mc Nicholas, who has been the only abortions in the state of Missouri, has been the only one to become a doctor in the state of
The Armed Guard of the clinic tells us that he defends the freedom of religion of the
News videos remind us of deadly terrorist attacks in clinics.
Let's move on to the time when abortion was illegal in the USA
The Association of Lutheran Church men guided women to reliable abortion doctors at the time.
The arguments of the interviewed pastor are good, but they are not even needed, a photo of a dead woman who has been killed is enough.
The deaths were in the EU in about 5000 years.
The legalization of abortion was defended in particular by the Republican party.
Already in 1967 in California, abortion law was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan.
Later, Reagan, in its presidential election campaign 1980, began to confuse religion with politics to collect voters.
The abortion position was also passed by his successor George Bush Sr.
And the same did Donald Trump.
To the deepest core of the matter, the documentary is in search of the root cause of the politicisation of
When the religious organisations that supported segregation were denied tax exemption, they became politically active.
An abortion was chosen as a stick horse
Religion has brought extraordinary knots to politics.
In writing this, we are in a situation where sexual harassment has been praised, but the president of the religious right has chosen the supreme court of kavanaugh, which several women now blame for sexual harassment.

At least 191 Palestinians have died in the Gaza demonstrations after March, when the Palestinians started on the border weekly demonstrations.
The wounded are according to the un human rights Councilman 12 000.
The protesters demand access to the Palestinian families in areas where the Palestinians were forced to leave when the state of Israel was founded in 1948.

The paedophile assistance service was immediately filled with reservations - in Finland about 40 000 experience interest in children
According to the estimate, % of men and a small part of women experience at least some sexual interest in the pre-age age.
In Finland, this means about 40 000 people.
It's been hard to get help from children or young people with sexual interest until now.
The Joint Serie Project of the criminal service support foundation and sex will train professionals to encounter pedophiles as customers and help people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was announced in the spring, the e-mail flood and the appointment times were booked very quickly, yle tells.
However, these promise will be released during the autumn.
The sexual affinity against children causes many shame.
Most of the paedophile s' emotions in themselves have not implemented their fantasies and thus did nothing criminal.
However, preference is usually a permanent feature.
Most of them wish to get rid of those thoughts that haunt and depressing them.
They also start a normal life, says to yle the sexual therapist Patricia the, who works as a specialist in the project.
In my opinion, work is valuable if one child is saved from sexual violence, the sle says.
Korean leaders or congolese gynecologist?
Us President Donald Trump Nobel Peace prize winner - the idea may sound strange, but trump is one of the biggest favorites for the award.
The background is trump's role in getting north Korea at least at the level of speeches to commit to nuclear disarmament
The biggest favorites of peace Nobel are based on the coefficients of the president of South Korea and the leader of the North Korea, Kim Jong-the, who have already met three times this year and promised to seek peace agreement between their countries.
The global warming of the Korean is significant, because last year we had a great deal of time.
However, for years, the rewarding of the Kim with an iron grip and the iron grip of its country would undoubtedly raise criticism.
Nobel Prize winners will be announced from Monday, and on Friday we will have the most attention to the peace prize.
If the prize is not given to the people who participated in the Korean peninsula diplomacy, there is one of the top candidates for the congolese doctor Denis Muk.
A reputable gynecologist has taken over thousands of women who have been victims of already in the Democratic Republic of Congo and become a leading expert in the world.
Muk has paid attention to sexual violence, which is a creepy by-product of many conflicts.
As a strong candidate, the un refugee organisation has also been held, which won the Nobel Peace prize in 1954 and 1981.
The Nobel Committee has told us that this year there will be 331 candidates for the prize.
The names of the candidates will not be disclosed to the
Trump himself wouldn't mind if the Nobel would get it.
In May, the journalist asked him in the white house whether he deserves a peace prize.
Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it, trump said with a smile.
I want to finish this.
The prize I want is a victory for the whole world, the president continued with reference to North Korea negotiations.
There are, however, things that make trump's Nobel unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee on the award has often given a confession to people and organisations representing liberal democracy and multipolar world order - just the kind of international cooperation that trump has been seen.
In The 2000's, the prize has received three American politicians, all of whom have been Democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, al gore in 2007 and Barack Obama in 2009.
The reward of trump would therefore require an ideological full translation of the Nobel Committee.

The traffic in the tunnel area was cut due to the announcement both in turku and Helsinki

The Highway was left at the time to drive even in the wrong direction after a moment of waiting.
When the first starts to act against the traffic rules, some others often follow, Traffic Security Liaison Chief Tapio Heiskanen is talking about.
According to traffic rules, you can't stop in motorways and tunnels like a compelling reason.
Road safety reminds us that in exceptional situations you cannot go to risk traffic with hasty solutions.
Alarm vehicles must always be given as unhindered as possible.
In the opposite direction, driving on the highway is especially forbidden, as well as making a u-turn and withdrawal.
The same bans are also valid in tunnels, where there is always a need to switch the headlights on.
Also stopping for no escape is forbidden, as of course also parking.
There have been even cases in the past where the driver has stopped in the tunnel to brush the snow from his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and the time for that action, heiskanen says in the transport security bulletin.

The M / s tampere on the way from hämeenlinna to tampere was late on Saturday night and was caught on the ground with water and water.
19 passengers aboard the ship and five crew members were evacuated to the mainland at night.
No one was hurt in haver.
Bobcat fans would have liked to continue their party on the ship until the morning, but of course it was more sensible to send them to the harbour and bus home, the remote said STT:lle.
Bobcat fans had been in hämeenlinna following the match of lynx and hpk, which ended with the 4-3th victory of the lynx.
According to the remote, Saturday's blood was due to the fact that the water surface and water was about half a meter lower than normal.
It was also difficult to find the nearest fairway mark covered with log droppings, which is why its reflectors did not appear normally in the dark autumn.
No more relevant collision
The blood happened on the west side of the narrow jumu strait after the ship route was below the bridge between tampere and Helsinki.
A greater drama in the case was not joined, as the speed of the ship was very low at the moment and the impact of the hit did not cause any more significant impact.
According to the remote, it has not caused any leaks and no pressure on the ship, and the ship's cruises are continuing normally.
The Diver went on Saturday morning to check out the ship's good before the ship started to get low.

The Trump judge candidate for harassment and drinking may stay on top of the top
Brett Kavanaugh, who is a judge of the supreme court of the United States, may well remain a member of the office, evaluate the programme director mika a from the foreign political institute.
So far, at least three women have accused kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior in the past.
According to a, doubts have brought so much political pressure to the Republican party that President Donald Trump can end up playing someone else in office.
In The United States, once again, it has happened that the presidential candidate for the supreme court has raised a lot of contradictions.
In this case, the judge candidate has usually retreated, says a.
This is how the president has been able to preserve his face
I think it was a Democrat.
The Supreme Court of the United States seeks to be above politics, but at least in kavanaugh's case, the choice of a new judge has become a politically sensitive process
If kavanaugh is appointed, the decision will probably be raining in the upcoming interim elections of the democratic party of the democratic party.
It would raise voting enthusiasm among young people and women who would be more likely to vote for Democrats.
On the other hand, the name of the conservative judge for the supreme court would be a long -
The appointment of the appointment will not be hit every presidency, as the judges of the supreme court will be appointed for life
In Practice, some of them have been retired from their own request at the age of about 70-80 years.
Some of the Republicans are hesitating
A background report is normally made from the candidates for the supreme court of the United States, a says.
Even though trump has ordered the FBI's additional report only a week's deadline, it can still bring up something relevant.
It might bring.
Rarely there is smoke without fire, says a.
According to the a, there is no doubt that there is still a lot of discussion about kavanaugh's suitability or impropriety before the Senate takes its decision.
The Republicans have a majority in the Senate on 51-49, but at least two female Republican Senators are considered to be sceptical about kavanaugh's appointment.
The most embarrassing thing would be that the name would be taken to the vote and the Republicans would lose.

Organic silliness once left my husband's speech, where he suggested it as a person to the story of ke, says a espoo comic blogger, a housewife and a former EU translator sari piippo.

Then 2014 Photos became a comic.
Piippo tells me that he never dreamed of making a comic, even though he had read Donald Duck, tint and asterix since he was a little girl.
I was the last one to draw as a child, but when these organic manuscripts began to be born, the situation changed.
I made some dozens of scripts for the shell first.
My daughter viivi valkama (s. 2000) is a skilled cartoonist, but I didn't get him to be lured in until the summer of 2016, when I bribed the vii with a drawing disc.
His enthusiasm lasted a dozen strip, and then I had to start trying, laughing piippo, who tells me that the drawing album was a great incentive for him.
The drawing disc is an easy and convenient tool to try to get something done.
On Paper I didn't even try to draw, tells me about piippo's relationship to drawing, which he usually does at night.
Scripts Pop up all the time, but I usually don't do it all at once.
One of the three-screen strip goes up to several hours.
I might do the screen at a time and play with the colors.
Starting the drawing is always the hardest, because drawing is not my strongest sport.
Sari Piippo says she appreciates the current comics of the newspaper, among other things, Scott Adams's dildo.
As a person of organic nature, a carrot-body mother with a salad hair is one of the most beautiful people in the l-theme.
Other people are male, chav and twins.
In the world of organic food, human being is what he eats.
The ideas of the series come from their own life and social media.
Sari Piippo doesn't want to preach or offer a forced bun even though the organic drink is in between.
Piippo says he'll read his series with his husband and children.
After all, it's such a great feeling when you look at the comic picture and says that this is what I've been doing today.
And There's plenty of challenges for home mother

The Oulu police managed to find the missing sienna inhibitor with a drone only in a few minutes.
The Rector of the high school high school, kimmo him, referred to the case and mentioned, among other things, that "with the help of prejudiced experience and effective education, we are also the tip of the world".
The Drone is a very new thing and even more recent police missions.
There is no statistics about the Finnish police being the master of the drone use.
According to him, there is a strong understanding that this is the case.
This has survived, for example, when the experiences of the Finnish police have been reported in international events.

Fists were flying on several occasions in kajaani
A little over years old man assaulted three men in a restaurant located in the centre of kajsa and on Saturday morning at pm.
A man first hit one of the men in the restaurant, as a result of which he was removed
Outside he pushed another man to the ground, and in the absence of a third man, the abuser was still hitting him.
The police took the attacker.
At the police station, a man was still acting aggressively and kicked another cop in the leg.
A man also threatened the police with abuse and killing.
The man was taken to the brig to calm
It is examined as a three-way assault and a violent opposition to the official.
There was also another assault case on the middle of the street in the centre of kajsa on Saturday morning.
The victim was assaulted by two men.
First, a 20-Year-old kajsa man hit the victim.
A little later, the other man knocked him down and the man who hit him was still kicking the victim.
Outsiders pulled away the victims from the victim and the police called the police.

The long line radio radio presenter erkki noodle is dead
As a long-term journalist, erkki noodle passed away from cancer when he was 83
Radio Presenter Erkki Noodle, 83, is dead.
He passed away from the incurable liver cancer that he told on his facebook page in March 2018.
It's time to go.
The doctor has said it, I live one day at a time, he commented on his situation in the evening magazine a month ago.
The safety of the aunt and the road must be guaranteed
The first time I got paid for the magazine was in 1984.
With these annual tires, there's a lot of things going on, it's usually a big news.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27.9.) from the insecurity of retail workers, I was amazed and at times even a little angry.
I also talked about the work of the professional union of the professional union of services (Pam).
He says criminal statistics don't tell you the real situation.
The problem is growing, although employers of course claim otherwise.
Police information only goes clearly to serious cases and a lot of real violence is not reported.
"companies have a duty to record their close-up situation on the basis of a safety law, but these statistics remain for internal use and do not collect any information", he said.
Mental injuries don't end up in statistics.
There has always been a problem in violent situations that they are not always born with physical injuries.
Psychiatric Trauma can be much more serious than bruises and wounds in spite of this.
The difference between violence and violence is difficult to pull when a certain level of aggressive threats must be counted as violence - even if there is no access.
Too many people are afraid of their work, even if the actual thing doesn't happen.
Some residential areas are restless.
The shop has acquired guards.
During the opening hours of the shops, there was a significant impact on the safety of sellers in the media.
"at the time, a lot of employers organized security services at least during the hours of the night and to prevent work alone", frizzy comment.
When nothing happens, let's make the wrong conclusion.
This seems to have been an effective effect, but this produces a new negative trend.
When the safety of the disturbance was well held, the image was created that security would be unnecessary.
Now in many places we try to find solutions to remove the expensive guard services.
Mild assault is a criminal offence, and it is quite understandable that the seller who was assaulted does not want to make an inquiry into a criminal who usually lives near the store.
But the same, according to the law of 2011, mild assault changes to the prosecution if it happens in the workplace.
I think we need precedents now.
The next time the aunt or uncle of the store is being abused, the police should investigate and the prosecution will blame.
When the court of justice put a few of the people in jail, and the sentence from the hard end of the penalty scale, the ways would be cleaned
A society where grocery store needs to be open for almost a night in small places, must guarantee the safety of trade workers.

The Sohl is looking for the his.
The most likely sohl was referring to the newly divorced sieppi, who laughed at the comment, even though it seemed confused at first.
Sieppi talked about his divorce for the first time in the evening of the evening messages.
The beauty beauty told me that he doesn't want to open the reasons for the difference in public, because it is between him and roope salminen.
He said he's not busy with a new relationship, he's going to focus on himself.
I'm focusing on my own things and especially I'm starting to live my own life alone, Sara Sieppi told me.

A fresh district court judgment is not in writing.

J Forecast: tomorrow's industrial activities will be visible in children's day care and social and health services
In public and welfare areas tomorrow, overtime and shift bans will be seen in particular in social and health care and children's day care, evaluate the president of the NHL Päivi Niemi-Laine.
The effects are going to be extensive, and they will be visible in the way that there are not enough staff on the spot.
Everyone has to wonder what way to pick up their kids.
The job of the employer is now to make sure that the services play and that no one's spirit is threatened, Niemi-Laine says STT:lle.
According to Niemi-Laine, the shortage of workers was also reflected in the beginning of the year when the members of the NHL were suspended due to the negotiations.
Employers have made it possible, through flexibility, that the staff have not been hired, but the workers have been left to work or have changed shifts.
This is not an industrial activity yet.
It is a very standard thing for every employee to take care of regular working hours and make them.
The NHL Is opposed to the efforts of the government to lighten the dismissal of small companies.
The Finnish labour market director markku noble does not undertake to assess the effects of overtime and shift bans.
However, he does not believe that they are very revolutionary, although services can be weakened.
Employers from all over Finland are aware of this and made the preparations that have to be done.
The area is so impossible, social and health work and technical sector, that it's hard to say.
The effects can vary very much by industry, by region and by employer, noble said STT:lle.
The Noble says that last week we had experience among other things, among other things, the middle and basic nurse union, the super and the social and health trade unions.
Their effects were pretty small.
The Ban on overtime and shift in the NHL Applies to workers, church, state and private social and health workers among other things.
For example, family nurses are excluded.
At this stage, the industrial sector is almost 100 000 members of the NHL.
According to Niemi-Laine, the activities of the NHL May last for a long time.
The Union is also prepared for other industrial activities if the preparation of the dismissal law continues.
The Government should now admit that here is a run to the wall and hard.
In the process of processing, both the ay movement and the government must come.
It's special that the hard ones are already in the barrel, even though the performance has not yet been given, the noble will update.

The great coral reef is still not a children's performance, but a performance that adults and children do in joint action.
It gives adults information and observations about children's way of taking information and making art.
Children's ability to throw into practice and common games also dissolve the distance between adults and children.
The great coral reef reminds me of a bit of his, fitness circle and nature topics, but finally it will be set up in different, non-Humane spaces around visits.

In the great coral reef we are both diving people who observe the life of Coral Reef and the corals that are considered.

To be a landscape of some kind, a landscape that looks at the landscape and an organism that looks like another organism or landscape - and all this at the same time.
For Kids, it doesn't seem difficult.
In other spaces, the group is working on the line of thinking and action to reach when the group consists of both children and adults, it is challenging.

Other premises have built their works in such a way that it respects the diversity of life also in political terms.
There are other generations, there are other types of consciousness, other species and their future generations, which are clear and clear.
Kids grow up too fast - I'm happy that my childhood didn't have smartphones
Today's children and young people are even more irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking all the time younger and younger.
In my opinion, children should be children throughout their childhood, not to mess up their lives because of substance and sex, because others say they do.
I was overwhelmed when my friend told me that he had had to pick up his sister in fifth grade this weekend from "boyfriend"
When he came to pick up his drunk sister, he told me about his sexual experiences from that night.
I could not possibly imagine my own sister in the same situation, because we have been told and warned throughout our childhood that the drugs can not be touched and sex is an adult thing.
I wish today's kids could live a decent childhood, and they wouldn't have to grow up too early because of the group pressure created by friends.
I keep seeing younger girls on Instagram who are in their pictures with makeup on their face and reveal their clothes on.
S is used to take and send pictures of the evening.
It's even harder for girls to guess what age they are.
Today's 13-Year-olds can easily look like 18-Year-olds and parents.
My childhood consisted of playing in the woods and playing game games.
I'm happy that I didn't have smartphones in my childhood.
I got to be a child for many many years and didn't have to think about what others think of me.
Yle: authorities told the government that the pearl of the case is not related to national security
According to the promoted ilkka kaner, the protection police and defence forces visited the defence and foreign affairs committees earlier this week.
The Finnish state leadership has been told that the investigation of the pearl of the air is not currently related to National Security, but to organised crime, news yle.
The information of anonymous sources confirmed to yle the chairman of the committee on defence, Ilkka Kanerva (kono).
According to Heather, the defence forces and the protection police visited the defence and foreign affairs committees this week to tell us about the ongoing investigation.
This is primarily considered as economic crime.
They were very strict that they would not speculate that there would be other, Heather commenting in an interview.
According to information, there has been no evidence of the connection to national security so far, but the investigation is just beginning.
There is no way to know what can be revealed from there, one of the people who interviewed us says.
A week ago, the extensive home search of the turku archipelago and the continent has raised the question of whether the investigation is a purely economic crime or a threat to the internal security of Finland.
The evening magazine bought a story earlier this week, which is going through arguments both for and against.
Video: dream paint saved Liverpool's losses
Liverpool's 1-1 % League start came to an end, but it was still more satisfied with the team 1-1 draw on Stamford Bridge.
On Sunday it will be exactly a year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and ran away from the 1-0-guest victory.
That's when the combination of Pep Guardiola sent a signal to the entire premier league that city was now serious.
Everyone remembers how the last season ended.
And surely Liverpool's manager j klopp arrived at the same idea in West London.
The Reds had started the Elite League with six consecutive victories.
Liverpool started stronger and especially virgil van dijk seemed to choose his own field to end.
Chelsea had this Wednesday's great allsvenskan guest victory from field road.
That's when eden hazard got out of the exchange bench to solve the match with a great
Now hazard was, of course, from the beginning of the minute.
In 25. Minutes, he was first in a small space with Mateo hard and j.
In the end, the croats saw hazard crashing forward and sent this perfectly weighted pass.
Hazard went down a little bit to the edge of the penalty area, but bombed the perfect left leg in the back corner of the bet
The pool watch was a little slow in the fight, and he didn't get his finger on the ball.
Klopp must have felt the loss of the defeat in a lightly unjust way, because almost immediately after antonio rüdiger cleaned up the mo control line.
In the second period, the chelsea goalie kepa got into real action.
The Basque guard reacted quickly to sadio man's bet and pushed the ball from the root of the pole.
On the other end of the day, the ali reset the risk of driving through hazard.
The best place of the guests came in 72. Minutes When James Milner found his focus on Bobby Firmino.
However, the brass star's head turned into a team of National Team David Luiz, who saved the host's leadership.
It couldn't take anymore 89. Minutes when the exchange man Daniel Sturridge was free to shoot from 25 meters.
The played in his old home stadium, and the attacker bombed it in honor of the top corner of the irresistible bet.
Liverpool's 1-1 % League start came to an end with a 1-1-draw, but it's still at the top of the league - together with Manchester City.
Chelsea is also firmly involved in the championship battle two points behind the tip.
In the clock transfer discussion the pot differences are deep
I remember when a decade ago a magazine asked different Finnish influences, which shares the Finnish people.
Juice Widow's answer was the only thing that was left to mind:
Some of the last names have an "n" judging and some don't.
The distribution lines can be born anywhere, and here was one served.
Finland has made it possible for the annual clock to be moved.
A lot of people agree that the two times a year has been the work of fools and caused a variety of problems.
Finally, this achievement seems to be the easiest part of the solution in Finland, even though it has not been easy.
The hardest thing is now to solve what time ends: the current summer or winter winter or some other time zone.
This will also make the people say their opinion. On the fi page.
The survey has opened the ministry of transport and communications, and it is open on Friday 12. October.
The discussion is going on at coffee tables and social media, and everyone has their word to say.
The people who defend winter time justify their position on the impact of morning light on the wellbeing of people and the night of the night with the effect of the evening light on the desire of people's outdoor life and
Both sides have their supporters and good arguments.
According to the studies, the morning light rhythms human day and gives a sentence.
On the other hand, if you do not especially suffer from waking up in the dark, more light on the movement of people outside and give you better opportunities for example
The amount of additional light after normal working day has already been calculated for class.
I'd prefer to take both, but it's bad for our location in the northern part of the world, we can't
Winter is too dark and summer for many too light anyway.
A typical discussion on the subject is that your own vision is driven and the second view is very strongly opposed.
The arguments of the counterparty are not exactly listening, because the most important thing is what it feels like.
Since almost everyone has an opinion on it, it is somewhat pointless to try to turn the other head.
It's a waste of gunpowder.
The subject is a very easy debate, because it does not require a great deal of effort and arguments.
These types of things are usually in the strongest and equally infertile manner.
I'm sorry if the wrong option is to be chosen, but I think you can adapt to that too.
And always it offers a suitable scapegoat if life feels sad.

The mute is going to turkey to follow the selection of the syrian quota refugees
The Interior Minister must be mute.) travel in the next few days to turkey to follow the selection of quota refugees coming to Finland.
Finland has been decided to take Syrian refugees this year from the refugee camps in turkey.
Selection trips are usually made a couple of times a year and representatives of the immigration agency, the ministry of labour and industry and the police are involved.
The delegation is already in turkey doing interviews.
The Unhcr is first elected by the un refugee organisation unhcr, who are particularly vulnerable.
In Practice, it has meant people who are considered to be in a particularly needy position in refugee camps, for example single families, disabled and sick, women and children.
More people are elected to Finland than in the quota, because in practice some are left for different reasons.
The silent way is also on the way to Ngos in the Turkish interior, süleyman man and the Syrian border.
On the way there is also the chief of staff of the ministry of interior ilkka
We talked about raising quota
Finland has been taking quota refugees since the 1970 s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees per year.
The quota was for a couple of years in 1 050 years, but since then there was no agreement to raise it.
The Coalition has supported the quota, but the project has last fallen to the resistance of the blue.
Prime Minister Juha Your (between.) recently presented an increase in the quota to 1 500-2 000 people per year.
The mute visit will be the first to be held by the minister of interior for the selection of quota refugees.
Previous interior ministers petteri orphan (ko k.) and Paula-(ko k.) time to move on to their new tasks before the visits were arranged.
Finland receives EUR 10 000 support for each of the most vulnerable refugees.
Now let's go to the wrong - no longer know whether to cry or laugh
Karelian news last Saturday about the draft law to change the animal welfare law.
The article received the impression that the bill in principle prohibits the marketing of all animals that are not individually authorised by ministerial regulations, as a result of the application of the bill.
So everything else is prohibited, not only for the animals mentioned in the regulation.
If the bill ends up in law, it means that we are rejecting the general principle in western democracies that the law expressly prohibits action that endangers the safety of society or the good way.
We are now in the process of imposing a ban on all activities that are not separately promised by the law or regulation.
The change causes that nothing new can be tried for example in business activities and do nothing else until the law or regulation that is adopted is given.
The Government's action in legislation has usually been weak.
If we go on the road that in Finland, everything is forbidden, which is not allowed separately, no longer know whether to cry or laugh.
I don't doubt that the animal welfare law requires an update.
But the law project in this way does not belong to democracy.
Unfortunately, I do not know the constitution very well, but I wonder if it will accept such a 'everything is forbidden, which is not allowed in law or regulation separately'.
Hopefully there will be some sensible minister who will suspend the progress of such a law project.

Status symbols don't attract friends - four facts about popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic or admired?
The researchers of the university of Sydney have outlined two of the "cool" species composed of different features: in general, the most attractive coolness and the opposite dissident coolness.
The most attractive people, according to the description of researchers, had many socially desirable features: they were outward-oriented, friendly, harmonious and qualified.
For dissidents, there was a typical distance, Independence, rebel and edge.
They wanted to experience their experiences and only cared for a little bit of external estimates.
Both guys combined good self-esteem and stable emotional life.
The role of tough is not cool: High status at teenage age does not necessarily lead to success later in life.
This is what the American research published in the child development magazine in 2014
The young people who dated early, party, applied for good-looking people and strive for others, was a young grown-up risk of using drugs and getting into crimes.

He was a supporter of abortion justice and sexual minorities and, for example, solved in 2015 with his voice that the same sex was given marriage justice throughout the Federation.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative than he is.
His choice for the supreme court may be locked in the right of conservative power for decades.

In Practice, you can't see the information of the elementary school grade, but by asking them to be printed.

It is extremely important for child care that parents can be involved in it.
The right of teenagers to privacy must naturally be taken care of.
Minors can have family situations where you can't talk about all things.
Often they are related to sexual health, where free care is a deeply relevant human rights.
