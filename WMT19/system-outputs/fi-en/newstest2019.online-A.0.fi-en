Finland is at the forefront of human capital comparisons, says the science journal Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years Finland was the number one year of statistics.
In 2016, the tip of the five was almost the same as in 1990.
In the past, Finland was followed by Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Later Holland ranked one higher and Canada instead of the list found Taiwan.
In 2016, the worst comparison was between Niger and southern Sudan.

The World Bank has aligned its human capital with economic growth.
Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois kept under control of Atleticon, the local game ended as a non-painted
Real Madrid's goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois stretched the splendor of Torjuntoihin, and the local game of Madrid teams ended in a non-target draw late Saturday in the Spanish Football League.
Atletico Madrid's Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were the closest to the goals, but the Belgian guard Courtois managed to fight.
Courtois played three seasons at Atletico, with a loan for the same season as Chelsea's player.
In the early week of the International Football Federation, Fifa chose him as the year's goalkeepers.
In real, the best finish was given to Gareth Bale, but his shot was past the end of the goal's opening.

The United States is now attacking the right to abortion-a powerful documentary explains why
The US Senate is currently trying to find out whether one of the nine members of the Supreme Court could choose Brett Kavanaugh, nominated by President Donald Trumpet.
In the Republican Party, many would like to have the decisive voice of Kavannaude be overturned against Roe, a decision known as Wade, which made the Usa a lawful year in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's documentary Reversing Roe-United States of America and abortion rights will tell you how the current situation has been flooded over the years.
As unbelievable as it seems, the subject is also topical in Finland.
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (SIN) has made publicity work against safe abortion and has received varying degrees of support for the power of the deputies of our country.
At the beginning of the powerful documentary, the gynecologist Colleen McNicholas, who, due to extortion of laws, has remained the sole physician in the state of Missouri.
The armed guard of the clinic tells us that he defends the freedom of religion in the Usa.
News videos resemble deadly terrorist attacks on clinics.
Moving to a time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At the time, the Association of Lutheran Church Men instructed women to provide reliable abortion doctors.
There are good reasons for the pastor who has been interviewed, but in fact they are not even needed, a photograph of a woman who has been made in a self-made abortion is enough.
The USA had around 5000 deaths per year.
In particular, the Republican Party defended the legalisation of abortion.
Already in 1967, California abortion law was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan.
Later, in particular, Reagan, in his presidential campaign of 1980, began to confuse religion with politics with voters in order to Haalian.
Abortion's position was also run by his successor George Bush senior.
And the same was also done by Donald Trump.
To the deepest core of the documentary is the search for the bottom cause of abortion as a matter of politicisation.
When the racial segregation of profitable religious organisations was denied tax exemption, they became politically active.
The stick horse was chosen as an abortion.
Religion has brought politics to extraordinary nodes.
As of this writing, in the Usa, there is a situation where sexual harassment kehuskellut but the voices of the religious Right have been captured by the President at the Supreme Court by Mr Kavnaugh'n, whom several women We are now blaming sexual harassment.
Kavanaugh can get the weight of the scales based on the rights of 164 million American women and girls.
Israeli army fired seven Palestinians, among them two children-on the border of major demonstrations
Nearly 200 Palestinians have been killed in half a year when Israel has been in the frontier zone.
On Friday, the Israeli soldiers fired seven Palestinians in the Gaza frontier zone, the Palestinian Ministry of Health says.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, two children are among the dead: Boys aged 12 and 14.
According to the Ministry, 505 people have been wounded.
Of these, 89 were wounded by bullets.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened fire and made an air shock to the border zone when the protesters threw Israeli troops through rocks and explosives.
The army says that it has begun to use force, that the demonstrators do not break or seek to the other side of the frontier fence.
At least 191 Palestinians have died in the demonstrations in Gaza since March when the Palestinians started the weekly demonstrations at the border.
According to the Un High Commissioner for Human Rights, 12 000.
The demonstrators demanded access for the Palestinian families to the regions where the Palestinians were forced to leave when the state of Israel was founded in 1948.
The Palestinian sniper has killed one Israeli soldier.
The areas and explosives dropped from the Palestinian side and from the helium balls have ignited woodlands and farmland in Israel.
Teemu Pukki got a penalty kick-could not shoot himself
Wigan's T.O. Chey Dunkley seemed to have poured him behind him in a penalty area.
The referee Gavin Ward allowed the game to continue.
According to his interpretation, Taklaus was clean.
Teemu Pukki could not believe his eyes.
The situation would have left to bother the referee Wardia, who condemned Norwich with a penalty of 85. Minutes when the buck was poured.
Ward looked like a penalty comma, and Mario Vrancic shook the 1-0-winning goal.
The buck has made Norwich five goals in the championship series.
Last Saturday I was born against Qprin in style with chest musculature.
The work was tasted again.
After he lost the ball, he continued to the end of the situation.
He created paint situations and defended tirelessly.
For Norwich the match was fifth in two weeks.
The team continues in the League Cup.
Behind is a five-victory streak.
The paedophile service filled immediately with reserves-in Finland about 40 000 experiences an interest in children
It is estimated that two percent of men and a small percentage of women experience at least some sexual interest in my present age.
In Finland this means about 40 000 people.
So far, children or young people who have been sexually assaulted have had difficulty in getting help.
The Correctional Foundation and the Sexpon Joint SeriE project will educate professionals to confront pedophiles as clients and help people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was announced in the spring, the email flood and meeting times of Sexpossa started with counseling and therapy, and the gathering time was very quick to complete, says Yle.
However, these promises will be released over the autumn.
Sexual preference for children causes shame for many.
The majority of paedophile feelings in themselves have not implemented their fantasies and thus did not commit any criminal.
However, preference is usually a permanent feature.
Most of them are hoping to get rid of the ideas that are distressing and depressing for them.
They also complicate normal life, says the noble sexual health firm Patricia Thesleff, who acts as a specialist in the project.
In my opinion, work is valuable if even one child is spared from sexual violence, says Thesleff.
Korean leaders or a Congolese gynecologist?
As the winner of the American President Donald Trump's Nobel Peace Prize, the idea may sound strange, but Trump is one of the biggest favourites in the award of betting odds.
The background is the role of the trumpet in getting North Korea at least at the level of rhetoric to commit to nuclear disarmament.
On the basis of the coefficients, the biggest favourites for the Nobel Prize for Peace are the South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korea's leader Kim Jong-Un who have met three times this year and promised to seek a peace agreement between their countries.
The warming of the Korean spaces is remarkable, as last year there were good gaps.
Yet, for years, the compensation of Kim, who was threatened by nuclear weapons and his country with an iron grip, would undoubtedly raise criticism.
The winners of the Nobel prizes will be announced from Monday onwards, and on Friday the highest priority is the peace Prize.
If the prize is not given to participants in the Korean Peninsula, the Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege is one of the top candidates.
The esteemed gynecologist has treated thousands of women who have been victims of rape in the DRC in the Democratic Republic of Congo and emerged as the leading expert in the world.
Mukwege's work has drawn attention to sexual violence, which is a gruesome by-product of many conflicts.
The Un refugee organisation, which won the Nobel Peace Prize between 1954 and 1981, was also a strong candidate.
The Nobel committee has been told that this year the prize will be 331 candidates.
The names of the candidates are not disclosed.
Trump himself would not mind if the Nobel laureate could.
In May, the journalist asked him about the White House to earn the peace Prize.
Everyone thinks, but personally I'd never say it, Trump said with a smile.
I want to get this done.
The prize I want is a victory for the whole world, the President continued with reference to the North Korea talks.
There are, however, factors that make the trumpet a Nobel unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee for the award of the prize has often acknowledged individuals and organisations representing a liberal democracy and a multipolar world order-just the kind of international cooperation that Trump has Seen.
In the 2000 century the prize has been awarded to three American politicians, all of whom have been Democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007 and Barack Obama in 2009.
Rewarding the trumpet would therefore require an ideological turnaround for the Nobel committee.
Fire alert in tunnel: Motorists behaved like lemmings and drove in the wrong direction
The traffic chaos that occurred on the first road in Lohja occurred on 8 September. September.
Traffic in the tunnel area was disconnected in the direction of both Turku and Helsinki.
When it became clear that it was a system malfunction, the fire department attempted to bring the traffic to normal.
However, it did not succeed very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the road traffic center said that it could not be opened, because there are motorists on the road and they drive how it hurts, on duty the fire master Pasi Käkäinen told the Stis at the time.
The motorway was then driven up in the wrong direction only after a moment of waiting.
When the first starts to work against the traffic rules, a few others often follow suit, with the traffic safety contact Manager Tapio Heiskanen amazed.
According to the traffic rules, motorways and tunnels must not be allowed to stop as a compelling reason.
Road safety reminds us that in exceptional circumstances it is not possible to start endangering traffic by hasty solutions.
Emergency vehicles must always be given the most unobstructed passage possible.
Driving in the opposite direction on a motorway is especially forbidden, as is the U-turn and cancellation.
The same bans are also in place in tunnels, where there is always a need to turn on the headlights.
Also, stopping without compelling reason is forbidden, as of course also parking.
Recently, there have even been cases where the driver stopped in a tunnel to brush up on his Lumia car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for that activity, Heiskanen says in the Traffic safety bulletin.
Ilves fans would have liked to continue their celebrations even though the ship was caught on the bottom of the lake
On the inland waterway M/S, the Ilves fans, which were transported by the Tampere Department, would have liked to be on board to continue to celebrate, even though the ship had been left at the bottom of the lake, says Juho Syrjä, who was the ship manager at the time of the event.
On the way from Hämeenlinna Tampere, M/S Tampere went out late on a Saturday night out of his route and remained at the bottom of the bow with Vanajavesi in Akassa.
The ship had been aboard 19 passengers and five crew members were evacuated at night to the mainland.
No one was offended by the Haverin.
Ilves fans would have liked to continue their celebrations on board until dawn, but of course it was more sensible to send them to the fire department by the Port and bus home, the remote said to the Stis.
Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna for the match between Ilves and HPK, which ended with the 4-3 victory of Ilveksen.
According to the discrimination, Saturday's haveri was due to the fact that the water level in Vanjavavesi was about half a metre lower than normal.
It was also hampered by the fact that the closest bus sign was covered by a log, which is why its reflectors did not appear normally in the dark in the blame.
No MAINITTAVAMPAA collision
Haveri took place on the west side of the narrow Jumusensalmi, shortly after the boat route was under the bridge between Tampere and Helsinki.
The greater drama was not associated with the case, as the pace of the ship was very low at the time of the event and no MAINITTAVAMPAA impact was caused by hitting the bottom.
According to the discrimination, the bottom failure has not caused any leakage or pressure on the ship, and the boat cruises will continue normally.
On Saturday morning, the diver went on to inspect the ship's condition before the ship began to tow off the low.
As a precaution, we are still in the dock to check that this is not the result of any damage.
The remote believes that M/S Tampere Next, at the end of next week, a barted cruise can be handled by the atonement.
The vessel's cruise season continues according to his Independence Day.
No use for ambulances
The rescue service received an alert on the incident on Saturday night a little half after twelve.
The port of Viiala was alerted to ambulances receiving evacuated passengers, but there was no use for ambulances.
On duty, the fire master Matti Willman said late at night that evacuation conditions on the lake were awkward due to darkness and rather heavy winds.
The rescue service in Pirkanmaa reported half of three after Sunday night that all the ships had been evacuated and the passengers were transferred by bus to Tampere.
The cruisers built in 1957 have been restored between 2001, 2014 and 2017.
In the event of harassment and the accused, the trumpet judge candidate may be missing out on top posts
Brett Kavanaugh, who is the judge of the Supreme Court of the United States, may well be missing out on the posts, evaluating Program director Mika Aaltola in Foreign Policy Institute.
To date, at least three women have accused Kavannauh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour during the study.
According to Aalola, doubts have brought so much political pressure to the Republican Party that President Donald Trump could end up with another person in office.
In the past, the United States has occasionally seen the presidential candidate as the judge of the Supreme Court having aroused a great deal of controversy.
In this case the candidate for the judge is usually withdrawn, says Aaltola.
This is how the president has been able to maintain his face.
Name of the port to Democrats in the Laar
The Supreme Court of the United States strives to be above the policy, but, at least in the case of Kavannagu, the election of a new judge has become a politically delicate process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, the decision to be taken by the Aaltolola is likely to be a Democrat in the Laar Congress in the forthcoming interim elections.
It would increase the enthusiasm for the vote among young people and women who are more likely to vote for Democrats.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge to the Supreme Court would be a long-standing victory for Republicans.
The occasion for the appointment does not hit every presidency, as the judges of the Supreme Court are appointed to life.
In practice, some of them have opted out of their own request for retirement at about 70-80 years of age.
A part of the Republican hesitate to refer to the
The United States Supreme Court judge candidates are also subject to a normal background report, Altola states.
Although Trump only ordered a one-week period for an additional explanation of the Fla, it can still bring something essential.
Yes it may bring.
Rarely is smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
According to Aaltolan, it is certain, at least, that the suitability or impropriety of kavaunaugh'n will be debated even more heavily before the Senate takes its decision.
In the Senate, the Republicans have a majority of 51-49 votes, but at least two female Republican senators are thought to be sceptical about Mr Kavnaughton's name.
The most embarrassing thing would be for the nomination to be exported to the vote and for the Republicans to disappear.
The woman identified the suspect as a military intelligence agent
A Russian woman has told the BBC broadcaster that she recognizes Salisbury poisoning as an agent of the Russian military intelligence service of a suspected Russian man.
On the basis of the photographs, the woman was told that she was Anatoly Tthepiga, who works in military intelligence in the Grui.
Online community Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia reported earlier that it had revealed another poisoning from suspected men to be a tthepiga.
In the past, they said they had found evidence that the current identities of men are covert identities.
The BBC group traveled to the Far east near the Russian-Chinese border, where Tshiiga grew up.
The woman living in the village recognized the young Tshigiga in the pictures published by Bellingcatin.
He recognized the same man in the British police's pictures, which featured a man who is now inviting Ruslan to Bosnia.
Russian men are suspected of being the former twin agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter poisoning Novitshok-nerve myryes in March.
Skalpalit survived.
Colonel Tthepiga has been awarded the honour of the Russian hero, among others, in 2014.
Russia is still denying a suspected GRU connection.
In September, the suspected poisoning men reported that they had in Salisbury as tourists in their interview with Russian TV.
Elderly throwing bags in the Sote reform
There is now a vivid example of what the change of the Sote reform limiter, as defined by the Sipilä Government, means in practice.
In my birthplace, the Vaala Sote services are produced by the municipality of Oulu, which is the former regional director of Attendon, elected as health service director in 2016.
The group leaders warn the board of the change limiter.
If the sote expenditure now rises, the municipal state aid will be cut in the future.
The city centre makers were scared, and most of them are ready for a major restructuring of the elderly, which would end the health Centre's Department of Institutional care and small memory units.
There would be an increase in home care, which means, in the light of long distances, that elderly people living in remote villages are ripped from their roots to be treated by the health centre ' at home '.
Attendo trusted the municipality to pay the customers.
The left wing of the Vaala did not have a bad preparation, but organised a good audience opportunity, which became a lot of relatives, close carers and also delegates of other parties.
I presented the Sote provincial preparation with slides to see how the elderly in the municipality are already the largest in the whole of Northern Ostrobothnia.
There was also a neighboring councillor, Carina Western.
The local newspaper made a big story about the event, and it again brought the Oulu draftsmen back to their feet.
The Sote draftsmen do not write in any paper that Attendo has built a new nursing home, which now awaits the empty inhabitants.
There are no other service providers.
The draftsmen speak only of the voucher, but do not tell us what level of treatment it can receive or the type of staff the Attendo will take to treat elderly people until hospice.
Without a nurse?
In fact, the sites of the health centre are discontinued because there is no medical night-time emergency.
Attendo should also be resorted to doctors in the Vaala health centre.
The example of Vaala illustrates how centring officers run delegates with incomplete information, and delegates are injected against the wall with a change limiter.
In this way, the Centre Party clears the inhabitants of the Vaala, for whoever is left to live voluntarily if there is an opportunity to move away.
Was the center of one electoral sentence that the whole country kept inhabited?
Turkish President Erdogan opened a grand Mosque in Cologne
In the city of Cologne in Germany, thousands of people showed their protest when the country visiting Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, opened Europe's largest mosque.
Several hundred people had gathered around the river Rhine in the morning.
Erdogan is not welcome, read the demonstrators ' signs, and the slogans condemned fascism.
A number of demonstrations have taken place during the visit to Erdoğan on Thursday, and the security measures have been tight.
Around 10 000 people were expected to protest in the streets of Cologne in advance, including the human rights situation in Turkey.
In the vicinity of the Grand Mosque, the supporters of Erdoğan had also gathered.
However, the police had isolated a large area of the mosque from the environment for safety reasons.

However, Merkel emphasised that there are deep differences between countries on issues such as human rights.
Review surrounds your visit
Both Cologne Mayor Henriette Reker and Prime Minister Armin Laschet of the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia withdrew their attendance at the inauguration when the review of Erdoğan accelerated.
A 30-year-old student from Turkey, Cansu, said that he had come to the protest against Erdoğan in Switzerland.
I want to have a voice for those who can not leave the streets in Turkey.
They have been arrested, killed and relegated.
For Erdogani, anything different from his own thinking is terrorism.
At the final stage of the German voyage in Erdoğan, a significant proportion of the population is Turkish.
Slovakia for three indictments of journalist murder
In Slovakia, three people have been prosecuted for the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
The prosecutor said on Friday that three people were accused of Kuciak and his fiance's murder and other crimes.
Earlier this week, the police arrested eight people in investigating the murder, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak was discovered in February, fired with his fiancé from his home in Bratislava.
He had studied the relations between politicians and the Italian mafia.
The police have doubted the murders associated with Kuciak's explanations.
The case and Kuciak's published article have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.

Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
The journalist Arto Nyberg is today to interview, for example, Vesa Heilalaa, in his live discussion programme.
Vesa is in the studio telling about his upcoming space trip, which he drafted from Virgin Galactica already in 2010.
The price was EUR 151 000, which needed a bank loan.
If the original plans had been true, Vesa would have been in space a while ago.
However, the departure date has been postponed for a year.
Now it seems that, after the misfortune of the unfortunate test, which occurred in 2014, and after the deaths of the dead, things are in the hole.
If all goes well, commercial flights will start this year or no later than next year.
Vesan flight number is 300, which means that his journey is about a year away from the first departure.
The flight lasts 2.5 hours and in a weightlessness of 5 minutes at a height of 100 kilometers, a Finnish astronaut tells us about its future website.
At the same address, he also has a background to his longing for space.
As a child I read a comic magazine called Space Travel and saw the Star Trek series on televisions.
Star Wars have been seen and that's what the thought was...
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.

In an interview with the Swiss magazine Blick, Mersu's British driver was asked, does he, that the release of Kimi Rauskösen from Ferrari services would help Hamilton in the rest of the season.
Hamilton leads the second driver of Ferrari in the World Cup with 40 points.
Just under three weeks ago, Ferrari reported that Raikkonen would not continue in the garage next season and Raikkonen announced his move to Sauber.
Of course, Hamilton doesn't think that Raikkonen would loose gloves in the counter.
I don't think Kimi will change in the remaining races.
He is an exceptional pro-fantastic driver.
He remains one of my favourite drivers and I am convinced that Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
For me, it makes no sense.
Hamilton has previously told me that Raikkonen has been one of his ancestors.
I don't know if Kimi is aware of this, but when I was young and daydreaming of Formula One, I was playing a F1 game on Playstation.

If there had been one less of the Vaasas, the match could not have been started.
FC Lahti Academy won the match 16-0.
The break in Lahtelaiset led 7-0.
One reason for the dealer's play is that the team has played A part in the same players as the A-young SM-series, the P20 series, and the men's Kakkonen C-blocks.
Vasa IFK has been playing in the Kakkonen in practice against the fall of the season.
At the end of Kakkonen's closing round on Saturday, Vasa IFK is forced to win the JBK in a guest match and at the same time hope that Tampere United will lose his own guest match against KuFua in the Siilinjärvi Toivola.

All good ends in time.
Today, it is a run of Korpela Kuja, which has been quite well kept for the domestic country drama.
The third season has gone like hot stones: Last week, the episode looked on television as a first show of 722 000 Finns.

Is it worth to work tomorrow in a small flunssassa?
Here is the facts for and against
Flu season is hot.
Many people are going to stay home or not.
However, it is worthwhile to consider whether others are going to infect the disease, because the diseases can be contagious even if their own symptoms are small.
Between the flu symptoms strike suddenly, between them appearing in the yeast.
In the latter option, you may already infect others, even if your symptoms feel small, says Prevention release.
Is it worth staying at home?
According to Prevthion, the flu is contagious even when the person itself has no symptoms.
The Virus is transmitted already a day before the symptoms start and from then on from five days to a week.
Children may infect the disease longer.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you should not be at school or at work.
The work can return when the cough is relaxed and no fever is any more, says Professor Gregory Poland.
You should also avoid training.
Too fast the return to the gym slows recovery.
Also, remember to wash your hands, swallow your handkerchief, and throw the glanders into the trash.
Painful movement though?
If you have to leave your home ill, consider using a protective mask.
The mask does not keep viruses under control, but keeps the user aware of the area of the head.
Then the fingers will not be placed in the nose or mouth, Poland says.
The sneezing is also limited to the mask.
How can we escape the infection?
The best way is still washing your hands and avoiding touching your face.
However, it is difficult to escape the latter.
In the United States, for example, the average person touches his eyes, nose or mouth every 15-30 seconds, Poland warns.
The new Miss Finland repeats the tradition of misty: "My husband is a hockey player"
The ice hockey player and the misses are often connected.
This was also the case with Alina Voronkova, 23.
The 2018 of Miss Finland's crown has been Alina Voronkova from Pertunmaa.
Beauty now lives in Lahti, where she moved to the age of 15.

Voronkova was teased at school for the father's Russian fatherhood.
The mother and father moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was tempted by my Russians.
In Pertunmaa, I had no friends at all, Alina says at the launch of the semi-finalists of the Miss Finland competition.

Soon the beauty of Misty was to find new friends and the day started to roll out in a hopeless manner.
At the age of 15, he imagines that he is an adult, but I certainly did not think afterwards.
Three years ago, Alina met Joonas Hurri, the current partner, who is familiar with the ranks of Pelicas.
After the SM-liiga career, the hockey player has played abroad, including Sweden and China.
In 2009 he was a Finnish team in the 18-year-old WORLD championships.
In the early days of courtship, the couple lived nearly a year in distance, but later Alina got to travel with her husband to the world.
If I could get to the winning triangle, and with it, I would be a career, so I don't want to believe it would affect our relationship in any way.
Even if we were to live separately, we would have a strong trust and a distant relationship is the good side, that the beginning spark remains the whole time, Alina grinned in May.

EX managers require Robert Helenius to pay outstanding fees
The evening game of boxer Robert Helenius against Erkan Teinherit is a shadow of a monetary dispute.
The evening messages were today reported by the boxing manager Jaakko Heluto and the deputy Judge Jussi Kokkala for the challenge of the application, in which a total of over 80 000 euro was paid by the Helenius with interest on arrears.
According to the application for the challenge, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helenius 15.4.2014-30.1.2015.
We have tried to reconcile, but there is no other alternative.
There has been a definite mandate, and a great deal of work has been done, says Kokkila to the evening messages.
The current manager of Helenius, Markus Sundman, sent a statement to the evening newspaper describing the events of the boxer's vision.
Helenius denies that it is required to pay the amount required.
According to the match, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services in a financially awkward situation for Helenius and promised to be able to organize matches and sponsor income.
It was understood that Helenius was obliged to pay only percentages of his matches.
It was repeatedly assured that Helenius would not need anything to pay, just to receive the income they have organized.
This is also the normal and only practice of the professional athletes ' manager in action.
There has never been an agreement on paid work and it would have been absurd in the context of the Helenius situation, Sundman explains in a message he has produced.
There was never a written agreement on cooperation.
According to the match, Helenius had wanted to agree on the income distribution in writing from the outset, but Kokkila and Sundman did not make a draft until the end of 2014.
He said that the proposal was a poor person and that he broke the cooperation with Kokkala and Helide.
Helenius did not once in dealings with Kokkala and Helide.
One year after the end of cooperation, Helenius had been assigned a "unique but extensive" invoice manager's work.
This year, the same arguments have been brought.
Helenius keeps a few things in a cowardly, in a reply.
Today, Helenius encounters the Boxing Association's "challenger", a contender on the list of the seventh Erkan Teperi in Stuttgart.

I heard my wife screaming for help, but then came the silence
Dozens of corpses lie in the hospital backyard of Palu, on the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia.
Only one building separates them from the area where the injured survivors are gathered to assess the injury and the need for treatment.
Patients are also treated outdoors due to aftershocks.
One of the most mobile in the hospital was the 52-year-old Paluga Baharuddin, who was looking for his son.

Sari Piippo left her career in Brussels and became a housewife in Finland-I think the idea of a comic-art shortage did not slow down
The organic shovel once went out of my husband's uttermost, where he suggested the story I developed, says the Espoo comic blogger, housewife and former EU translator Sari Piippo.
Sari Piippo says that she was a member of the European Economic and Legal Affairs Committee in Brussels until after the fourth child became a returnees ten years ago.
I have enjoyed my home mother very well.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point it came to mind that what it would do when the slightest kid started to be big.
Then the 2014 picture became a cartoon.
Piippo tells us that he never dreamed of making a comic, even though he had read Donald Duck, Tintin and Asterix from the outset.
I had drawn the last time as a child, but when these organic waffle manuscripts began to emerge, the situation changed.
I made the next top some dozens of screenplays in the drawer.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (born 2000) is an accomplished designer, but I didn't get him to be tempted before the summer of 2016 when I donated the drawing board.
His enthusiasm lasted for a dozen strips, and then I was forced to start trying himself, laughing at the Piippo, who says the drawing board was a big incentive for him.
A drawing board is an easy and convenient tool to try and get something done.
I have not even tried to draw a paper, says Piippo in his relationship to drawing, which he usually does in the evenings.
The manuscripts popers to mind constantly, but I usually don't make it ready at once.
It takes up to several hours to get to one three-screen strip.
I might make a screen at a time and play with the colors.
Starting drawing is always the hardest thing to do, because drawing is not the strongest of my species.
Sari Piippo tells about her appreciation of contemporary newspaper comics, including Scott Adams ' Dilberis.
The Organic Shack is the "L"-themed mother of the carrot-and-stick-hair-Pehko.
Other persons are male, Fjortis and twins.
In the organic world, man is what he eats.
The ideas of the series come from their own life and social media.
Ricky P do not want to preach or to offer the forced buns even if the organic shack is in the case.
Piippo says that she is reading her husband and children.
After all, it's such a great feeling when you look at the comic and find out that this is what I've done today.
And the challenges are enough for a housewife!

Rehn wondered about the luxury of ending Europe in a trade war: "Keep watch the next tweet"
The trade war between the United States and China is reflected in the global economy.
Growth forecasts have been calculated throughout Europe and the Finnish bank has also slightly lowered its own economic growth estimates.
Mr Olli Rehn, the Director-General of the executive, said in the first, that even if the tension is not directly affected by the European trade flows, it undermines confidence, which in turn reflects the investment decisions of companies.
The situation also applies to the export of Finnish companies.
In the opinion of Mr Rehn, Europe is very much at the moment.
It has succeeded in building an interpeace with the United States and has also helped to calm the situation with China and Japan.
In the opinion of Mr Rehn, Europe does not seem to be crushing the trade war.
Keep Watch the next tweet and evaluate it afterwards.
We have a time for an unforeseen partner in Washington, but he said in an interview with YLE.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of them is the third largest national economy in the euro area, Italy, which is also one of the most indebted countries in the euro zone and throughout the Western world.
The market reacted sharply yesterday to the Italian government on Thursday evening to clearly present the deficit budget.
Next year's deficit is over 2.4% of national product.
Mr Rehn sees the situation in Italy as worrying.
Five per cent of the country's lending is a problem of credit and there are more than 10% of marshland loans.
In addition, its public finances are in poor straits and the country seems to have regained its commitment in relation to its European partners.
It may not be a good idea to paint new crises yet, Mr Rehn replied when asked whether Italy would be taking the new economic crisis in Europe.
Another thing that affects Europe is Britain's resignation from the Eu.
Rehn hoped that it would be in harmony.
There would be much more negative effects on the dispute.
Rehn started as president of Suomen Pankki in July.
Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank (ECB), will withdraw from his office in a year's time.
The debate on his successor has begun.
The name of both Rehn and his predecessor, Erkki Liikanen, has been a glimpse of the speeches.
It will probably not hurt if the Finnish names are involved, Rehn said, adding that there is no intention to comment on this further.

The lost mushroom was found thanks to an "unprejudiced experiment"
The Finnish police's drone skills are at the top of the world: "We are being asked about trainings"
According to the rector of the Police College, the police can use the drone in addition to missing searches, for example in crime scene investigations and reconnaissance missions.
On Tuesday, the Oulu police managed to find a lost mushroom maker in Raahe in just a few minutes.
The rector of the University of Applied Sciences, Kimmo Himberg, referred to the incident and mentioned, among other things, that "with an open-minded experiment and effective training, we are the world's tip".
Drone is quite a new thing and even more recent police missions.
Nowhere is there any statistics that the Finnish police would be the champion in the use of drone.
According to Himberg, there is a strong perception that this is the case.
This has survived, for example, when the experience of Finnish police has been reported at international events.
There is a terrible interest in it elsewhere, Himberg says.
It would be very hard for visitors to see the activities of the Finnish police.
We are asked for trainings.
Becomes even more common
Himberg recalls that it is very important to find lost in the winter conditions in Finland as soon as possible.
As stated, in the Raahe case, the stray was found in just a few minutes with the drone.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
According to Himberg, they are to be trained more.
The drone is already heavily used in police duties and is becoming more and more common in the future.
So I would dare say, Himberg says.
In addition to the search for missing persons, the police may use drones, for example, in accident and crime investigations and in certain intelligence missions.
For example, there is already a need to check some area for a little longer, where there is a potential fear that violence will be encountered there.
The drone may then be used for pre-enquiry.
Karelian Rugby rose to the first diva
The Karelian Rugby party in Kuopio, on Saturday, has a 2-division victory.
Joensuulaiset were still in the mid-7-12 at the Helsinki Rugby Club in the middle of the match, but found a storyline in the second cycle and whispered the south to 26-12.
The 2-division championship also knew Karelian rugby's historical ascent to the 1st Division.
In the past, the club has been playing in the singles, but at the time the Finnish rugby league was divided into two levels, the SM-sarja and several-tier 1 divisions.
The club is going to take a series of seats, but it knows the next winter very hard work.
The current roster of less than twenty players must be brought up to 25.
The 1 division also knows the number of games and longer game distances, so the fundraising must also be in line with it.
Eagle Peninsula launches season in Montreal, strengthens head coach
The Montreal Canadiens ' ice hockey Nhl, the head coach Claude Julien confirmed in the club's Twitter account that the Finnish striker Jesperi the Eagle Peninsula starts the season in Montreal.
He was drafted in the first round of the three summer ceremony by the Montreal Super Promise.
The striker joined Montreal in late summer and has made strong excerpts from the training matches of September.
In the first training match, Kotka Niemi succeeded in making a goal.
Head coach Julien praised the Finnish major developments since the arrival of the newcomer to the camp.
The NHL regular season starts on the night before Thursday next week.
Montreal meets in the opening round of the Toronto Maple Leafs.
What is a good leader?
There has been much talk of leadership this week in Finland.
The Chairman of Nokia Board, Risto Siilasmaa, told Hs in an interview about his book a paranoid optimist, in which he shed light on his leadership philosophy.
He also criticises the leadership of his predecessor, Jorma Ollila.
Ollila disputed the allegations sharply, but in previous Nokia reports the inability of managers to act as a team has been mentioned; The fear and the lack of speech that caused the collapse of the mobile telephony business.
The risk appetite and agility of the company's ascent phase disappeared.
During the week, Helsinki was also a business giant event for the Nordic Business Forum, which drew the Finnish business cream to the exhibition centre.
On the podium was the main star of Barack Obama, with 12 business world stars.
The talk of good leadership was enough.
The legend of the leaders Gary Hamel said that a good leader must dare to take the company to the future even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are mentally most tied to past decisions.
John Mackey, founder of the wide range of organic Whole Foods, said that the director should know how to communicate with all staff about the purpose of the company.
And that purpose cannot be merely a victory for the owners.
The success of the book's Introverces, written by Susan Cain, reported that the most successful leaders have been proven humble.
They act calmly, quietly and purposefully.
Often they are introverates.
The financial sector professor, Aswath Damodaran, reminded us that the qualities of a good leader must be hit with the life cycle phase of the company.
At the beginning of the company, the director must tell the story to which the company's future is based.
The mature stage of the grown company needs a leader who knows the numbers.
These doctrines in the Nordic Business Forum listened to 7 500 visitors-mostly Finnish leaders.
They had the risk of information colic.
A good leader requires a lot.
Therefore, leadership is so often wrong, even at the highest level.
There were also Siilasmaa and Ollila.
They chatted with each other on the backstage.
However, they were unlikely to wonder whether they were the right leaders at the right time for Nokia.
And their humiliation was not easy for the outside to judge.

The name of Macedonia has been the cause of decades of discord-now the people will vote in the matter of the elections
In the Balkans, Macedonia is currently voting on a proposal for the country's new name.
Under the agreement of the Macedonian and Greek governments, the Republic of northern Macedonia would be called.
Greece has hitherto blocked its veto on Macedonia's efforts to become a member of NATO and the Eu.
According to Greece, the name ' Macedonia ' belongs to its northern province.
The question of a referendum does not mention a new name, but asks whether a voter should be accepted for EU and Nato membership of Macedonia.
The vote started at least at the school in the capital city of Skopje.
In the school voted retired nurse Olivera Argirosvka hoped for agreement.
A referendum will mean a change if it opens the door to Europe and to NATO.
It means a change especially for young people, he said.
In 1991, the independence of Macedonia has been used in official contexts as the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
The government of Prime Minister Zoran Zaev has campaigned for the agreement to be approved.
The nationalist opposition in the right, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has called for the boycott of the referendum.
In addition to the result, tension is sufficient to increase the turnout over the 50% required.
The referendum is not binding, but the victory of the Yes vote would allow the mandate to change the Constitution.
A two-thirds majority of Parliament is needed to change the constitution.
The Greek Parliament still has to approve the agreement.
Polling points are closed for eight o'clock in the Finnish time.
A handsome win!

Students play a rare pea: the ancient tragedy-the simplistic Oresthesia influences the visual
Ancient tragedies are a rare delicacy on the Finnish scene.
For example, the National Theatre has been seen in the last ancient tragedy, the Sofocles Filoktetes, in 1988.
Now the Theatre Academy brought a tour of the National Theatre to the beginning of the ancient Spectacle trilogy, Aeshyloksen Oresteia.
In 2015, the Blades Open! Projects, theatre Academy students work with the Professional director internationally.
Mikko Roiha, living in Berlin, is the director of this fourth project, as the first.
The international premiere of Oresteia was awarded in Berlin in April.
The atonement of Oresteia sums up the report of the end of the death sentence of the doomed atresia and the birth of the rule of law, to his credit, to hours to twenty minutes, especially through the intensification of choral units.
The work will be very faithful to the spirit of the fine Finnish translation of Kirsti Simonsiali (2003).
Dramatic lights and a revealing presentation of the theatre scene highlight the simple and bright stage thinking.
It is centered on the dynamics of the choir Irtautuvien, the performer of the name roles, and the choir.
The presentation uses both duplicate and three-way name roles.
The actors are not eliminated at all from the scene, so, for example, the Agamemnon of the Trojan War and the murder of the Cassandra in this war of honour are shown on the scene, contrary to the customary tradition of the ancient presentation.
Of course, the presentation does not emphasize that it is faithful to the tradition of the ancient presentation.
Rather, a modern, faithful interpretation of the text is created in the eyes of the spectator, constantly conscious of the ritual roots.
Roiha has succeeded in bringing the students of the master stage into a rhythmic set of a dense group, even as a single organism.
The actors, especially in the choral parts, which are highly expressive in the sculpture group formations, are able to get their rights bare, only on the scene of the white curtain.
Impressive.
Oresteia's performance tour continues in Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.

Fists Viuhuivat several times in Kajaani
In just over thirty, a man assaulted three men in a restaurant in the centre of Kajaani and in the foreground on Saturday morning.
The man first struck one man inside the restaurant, as a result of which he was removed from the scene.
In the outdoors he was poking another man into the ground, and in the absence of a third man, the assault was still slapped by him.
The police took a beating stick.
In the police station, the man was still aggressive and kicked another policeman in the leg.
The man also threatened the police by assault and killing.
The man was taken to the pipe to calm down.
The issue is examined in three cases and the violent suppression of an official.
In the centre of Kajaani there was also another assault incident on Saturday mornings.
Victims were beaten by two men.
First, some 20-year-old Kajaani man slapped the victim.
A little later, another man poured him into the ground and previously smitten the man still kicked the victim.
Outsiders pulled the beaters further away from the victim and the place was played by the police.
However, the authors were already going to leave before the police arrived.
The police will ask the event eyewitnesses to contact the Kajaani police by telephone 0295 416 520 or by email at tutkinta.kainuu@poliisi.fi.
The long-line radio host Erkki Pälli is dead
Erkki Pälli, who was known as the long-term journalist, died of cancer at the age of 83.
Radiovce Erkki Pälli, 83, has died.
He died of incurable liver cancer reported on the Facebook website in March 2018.
Yes this is now going on.
The doctor, too, has said, I live a day at a time, he commented on his situation in the evening newspaper a month ago.
The safety of the trade and the road
I received my first newspaper salary in 1984.
With these annual rings, the subject of something is amazed, it's usually a big news story.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27.9.) The retail workers ' insecurity, I was amazed and at times even a little annoyed.
I also spoke to Erika Kähärti, the work environment expert in the service Sector Union (PAM).
He says that crime statistics do not tell the real situation.
The problem is growing, although employers obviously argue otherwise.
The police will only be aware of the cases which have been seriously experienced, and many of the correct situations of violence will not be reported.
"It is true that companies have a duty to statistics near their misses on the basis of the safety law, but these stats remain for internal use and their data is not collected," he said.
Mental disabilities do not end with statistics.
There has always been a problem in violent situations that they do not always result in physical injury.
In spite of this, psychiatric trauma can be much more serious than bruising and wounds.
The difference between the situation of violence and the threatening situation of violence is difficult to draw when a certain level of aggressive intimidation is to be counted as violence-even if there is no access.
Too many people are afraid of their work, even if the actual act does not meet.
Some residential areas are restless.
The shop has been acquired by guards.
With the release of the opening hours of the stores, the höykytys time of the store had a high impact on the safety of sellers.
"At that time, many employers organized security guard services for at least night-time emotions and to prevent work alone," says Käärä.
When nothing happens, the wrong conclusion is drawn.
This now seems to have had an effective effect, but this produces a new negative trend.
As a result of the guarding situations, the impression was created that security would be unnecessary.
Now, in many places, we try to find solutions to remove costly guard services.
Mild assault is the plaintiff's offense, and it is quite understandable that no pahoinpidellyksi had a seller to want to make an enquiry about a criminal that usually resides in a shop nearby.
But the same, under the law laid down in 2011, a slight assault becomes a public prosecutor if it occurs at the workplace.
I think that precedents are now needed.
The next time you trade the lice or beaten, should the police investigate and the prosecution to blame.
When the right would put a few beatmen into jail, and then judgment from there the penalty scale from the hard end, then the ways of trimming.
A society in which the grocery store must be a small place, open all day and night, must guarantee the safety of the trade workers.
Heidi Sohlberg checked to him before the start of the live broadcast-"Sara, Iiro is married"
The crown of the Missi will not be seen in the traditional way on TV, but it will appear on the Viafree website.

The front-line races are followed by many previous years Miss Finland.
Among other things, Sara Chafak and Sara Sippi were sitting next to each other and Sohlberg was throwing a small joke in either direction.
Sara, Iiro is then married!
Sohlberg was a consolation for the other.
What was more likely, Sohlberg, was referring to his very divorced sip, who laughed at the comment, even though he seemed confused at first.
The Sioppi spoke for the first time in the Journal of the evening messages.
Beauty was told that she did not want to open up the reasons for the difference in public, because it is a matter between her and Scrooge.
He said he was not busy with a new relationship, but he was going to focus on himself.
I focus on my own things and especially in the field of living my own life alone, Sara Sippi said.
Harjulan's status of marriage became apparent at a later stage, when Sohlberg accidentally mistakenly called Janni Hussia and Iiro Harju as a couple.
The presenter of the trio laughed at Mokalle.
Iirohan was married or how it went?
Janni Hussi checked out Mokan.

Four witnesses, two women and two men were heard in court.
The victim 34-year-old must pay compensation for pain, suffering and temporary detriment totalling EUR 5800.
There is hardly any such money, because the sentenced person is already in debt for recovery.
The prison sentence is not a man's first.
The night magazine does not describe the name of the sentenced person to protect his privacy.
The recent district Court does not have the legal force to write this.

Filipino inventor flies by drone car-this avoids traffic jams
Mendiola is a Filipino inventor, hip-hop dancer and some kind of geek fearless.
He is now part of a growing world that swelies with his flying car-or at least his own version of it.
As competitors, he has such factors as Audi and Airbus.
However, Mendiola does not believe in mass production.
According to reports from the world, the man has used much of his property to build his dream.
He began the development of his flying car six years ago.
Now he's calling the development version of the drone car.
He recently said he had made the first successful test flight-he flagged his device at an altitude of more than seven metres.
One of his goals was to avoid traffic jams.
I hope that the device raises positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago, Mendiola said of the British Daily Mail.
JHL anticipates: Collective action to begin tomorrow will be reflected in children's day care and social and health services
In the public and welfare sectors tomorrow, the overtime and shift bans are shown, especially in social and health services and in children's day care, by the chairman of JHL, Päivi Niemi-Laine.
The effects will be extensive and will certainly be reflected in the way that there are not enough staff on the spot.
Everyone is going to wonder how to apply for their children.
It is now up to the employer to make sure that the services are playing and that nobody's life is threatened, says Niemi-Laine.
According to the Niemi loan, the shortage of workers was also evident at the beginning of the year when the members of JHL were in a ban on overtime and shift in the negotiations.
Through flexibility, employers have made it possible for staff not to be hired, but for employees to be overworked or to have exchanged shifts.
This is not a collective action yet.
It is a norm in the workplace that every worker is treated as a concern for regular working hours and is only done with them.
JHL opposes the actions of government intentions to lighten small business redundancy protection.
Markku Jalonen, the labour market leader of Kunniemployers, does not prejudge the effects of the overtime and shift bans.
However, he does not believe that they are very revolutionary, although the services may deteriorate.
Employers around Finland are aware of this and have done the preparations for what needs to be done.
The area is such an impossibly broad, social and health action and technical sector that hard to say.
The effects can vary very much by industry, region and by employer, Jalonen said to the Sts.
Jone says that last week there were already experiences, including the three-day activities of the middle and primary nurses ' super and the social and Health Trade union, which are responsible for the work.
Their effects were quite minor.
The ban on overtime and shift of JHL applies to municipalities, the church, the state and private social and health workers, among others.
For example, Family day carers are limited to outside.
At this stage the collective action is subject to nearly 100 000 JHL members.
According to Niemi loan, JHL'S operations may take a long time.
The Union is also prepared for other collective action if the law on dismissal continues.
The Government should now admit that in this run to the wall and hard.
In the opinion of both the AY movement and the government must come against.
It's a curious fact that hard is already in the tweet, even though the show hasn't been delivered yet, Jalone is updating.
A large coral reef with children and adults-a presentation in fitness circles
In other modes-the collective large Coral Reef premiered last spring in Hamburg and last Saturday it was aired a second time in Finland, this time in Kannel House.
Like the group's previous works, a large coral reef is a work that is built from start to finish together with the audience.
However, this time, a clear-track presentation is also being built, which refreshes and sums up the observations made in the initial exercises.
There is also a fairy-tale magic for the children.
The child's perspective has already been included in the preparatory phase of the work.
However, a large coral reef is not a children's presentation, but a presentation that adults and children do in collaboration.
It gives adult information and observations on the way children take information and make art.
The ability of children to throw into the exercises and joint play also is a dirty distance between adults and children.
A large coral reef reminds me of some fairy tale ballet, a fitness circuit and natural facts, but it is definitely being tuned around for visits to other, non-human living spaces.
A large coral reef starts with corals, as well as the exploration of the coral reef and the fish's commercial lines.
In six different gyms, you'll learn, among other things, the rays and the gestures of the sea horse.
Finally, a less than an hour-long presentation with music, lights, and shiny paints and costumes will help you explore the life of the coral reef.
In the large coral reef there are both diving people who observe the coral reef life and corals that are being explored.
In addition, we are examining organisms.
The eyes and observations that are addressed in many directions make the show dense and life-teeming.
To be a landscape of an organism, a living organism, and a second organism or landscape for the organism, and all of this at the same time.
For children it does not seem difficult.
In other modes, the group strives for the boundary between thought and action, which can be reached when the group is made up of children and adults is challenging.
On the other hand, the involvement of children makes it more significant.
After the workshop, a silent demonstration of endangered corals is held in Sistor.
The damage beyond human comprehension must not be allowed to harden, although it may be difficult to comprehend the significance of self-esteem in the face of the destructive visions.
Others have built their creations in a way that respects the diversity of life, including the political gesture.
There are other generations, there are other kinds of knowledge, other species and their future generations, whose wonder and bread it is a clearing space.
Children become mature too fast-I'm happy that my childhood had no smart phones
Today's children and young people are more responsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking constantly at a younger and younger age.
In my view, children should be kids throughout their childhood and not mess with their lives because of substance and sex, because others say they do so.
I was embarrassed when a friend told me that she had to get a "boyfriend" on her fifth grade at the weekend.
When he came to get his drunk sister, he said he had a sex experience from that evening.
I could not possibly imagine my own sister in the same situation, because we have been told and warned throughout our childhood that substance abuse should not be touched and sex is an adult affair.
I hope that modern children will be able to live a decent childhood, and they will not have to be grown too early because of the peer pressure created by their friends.
I am constantly seeing young girls in Instagram who are wearing makeup on their faces and revealing their clothes.
Snapchat is used to take and send images that reveal in the evenings.
It is even harder for girls to guess what age they are.
Modern 13-year-olds can easily show 18 years of age and Vanhemmiltakin.
My childhood consisted of playing in the Woods and playing board games.
I'm happy that my childhood had no smart phones.
I got to be a kid for many many years, and didn't have to think about what others would think of me.
Yle: The authorities told the state leadership that the case of the airistless gem is unrelated to national security
According to the interview of YLE, Ilkka Kanhavan, the protection police and the armed Forces were informing committees on defence and foreign affairs earlier this week.
The Finnish Government has been informed that the investigation of the airless helm is not currently related to national security, but to organised crime, Newsoi Yle.
The information of anonymous sources was confirmed by the Chairman of the Committee on Defence, Ilkka Kanerva (Kok).
According to Heather, the armed forces and protection police held this week in the Defence and Foreign Affairs committees to report on the ongoing investigation.
This is seen primarily as a financial crime.
They were very strict about not speculation that this would be the other, Heather commented in an interview with YLE.
According to the YLE information, there has so far been no evidence of a connection to national security, but the investigation is only in its early embryonic.
We cannot yet know what can be revealed from there, one of the people interviewed by the YLE.
A week ago extensive home searches in the Turku archipelago and on the mainland have raised the question of whether the investigation is about purely financial crime or a threat to the internal security of Finland.
Earlier this week, the evening newspaper consisted of a story that goes through allegations both for and against.
Video: Dream Paint saved Liverpool's defeat series
Liverpool's 100% Premier League entry was completed, but it was still a happier team in the 1-1-draw at Stamford Bridge.
On Sunday it will be exactly one year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and escaped to the 1-0 guest victory.
At that time, the combination of Pep Guardiola sent a signal to the whole Premier League that City was now in earnest.
Everyone remembers how the last season ended.
And certainly Liverpool manager Jûrgen Klopp arrived with the same idea to west London.
The Reds had started the Premier League with six consecutive victories.
Liverpool started out more strongly and, in particular, Virgil van Dijk seemed to dominate his own field alone.
He was the winner of the Great League Cup in mid-week.
At that time, Eden Hazard emerged from the exchange bench to solve the match with a great individual performance.
Now, the Hazard was, of course, right from the start of the minute.
On the 25th minute he first took a small space with a triangle game with Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
Eventually, the Croat saw Hazard rushing forward and sent him a perfectly weighted pass.
Hazard drifted to the edge of the penalty area, but bombed the perfect left leg to the rear corner.
The pool's brasserie Alisson was a bit slow in his fight and didn't get like a finger head to the ball.
Klopp certainly felt the defeat of the position lightly unjust, because almost immediately after the succession, Antonio Rüdiger clean sweep Mo Salah's goal line.
In the second period, Chelsea-Veskari Kepa was also in action.
The Basque guard quickly reacted to the tow of Sadio Mané and pushed the ball into a corner-kick.
On the other end, Alisson will be thrown through the passage of hazard.
The best place for guests came 72. Minutes, when James Milner found Bobby Firminon.
However, he was directed towards the team mate David Luzia, who saved the host's lead role.
It still didn't last 89. By a minute when Daniel Sturridge was free to shoot at 25 metres.
Sturridge played at his old home stadium, and the attacker bombed it to honor the top of the irresistible bet.
Liverpool's 100% league-start was completed in 1-1, but it is still at the top of the league-together with Manchester city.
Chelsea is also firmly involved in the championship battle with two points behind the tip.
In a clock transfer conversation, the Poterot is deep
I remember when a few decades ago a newspaper asked various Finnish influences to share the Finnish people.
The answer to Juice Leskinen remained the only mind: Nen-terminal.
Some of the last names have nen-suffix and some not.
Jakinjojah can be born anywhere, and this was one of the most tender.
In the EU, Finland has achieved the abandonment of the annual clock transfer.
Very many people agree that the bell-moving twice a year has been a silly thing and has caused many problems.
In the end, this achievement seems to be the easiest phase of a solution in Finland, even though it is not easy.
The hardest thing to do now is to decide what time is to end: the current daylight saving time or another time zone.
This also gives the people a say on the otakantaa.fi page.
The survey has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and is open until Friday, 12 September. October.
The debate is hotly debated at the coffee tables and in the social media, and everyone has his say.
The winter time is defending its position with the effect of the morning light on people's well-being and summer time defending the effect of evening light on the desire to open the people and thereby to prosperity.
Both sides have strong supporters and good arguments.
According to the research, the morning light rhythms the human day and gives Virkeyttä.
On the other hand, if not especially suffering from awakening in the dark, increases the luminosity of people's movement outdoors and gives better opportunities for example in autumn yard work.
The amount of extra light after a normal working day is already counted.
Preferably I would take both, but the bad thing about our location in the North corner of the earth is not possible.
The winters are too dark, and the summers for many are too bright in any case.
The typical debate on this issue is that it is a very strong opposition to one's vision and a very sharp stance against the other.
The arguments of the opposing party are not just listened to, because the most important thing is how it feels.
Since almost everyone can find an opinion on this, it is somewhat pointless to try to reverse the second head.
It returns Ruth to the drain.
The subject is terribly easy to debate, because it does not require a great deal of commitment and a mutu feel is sufficient justification.
In general, similar types of issues are often controversial and equally infertile.
I would not be annoyed if the wrong option is selected, but I figure that it adapts.
And always it also offers a suitable scapegoat if life feels like a apeor.
Josba fought a winning guest victory
JOSBA's first guest game in Floorball Divaris produced a full three-point score against Nurmo Jymin.
Jobba went on a home trip to Seinäjoki 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) with a win.
Nurmo was still in paint at the beginning of the third installment, but Josba applied for compositions and recycled men in chains.
In 50.47 the brothers Eetu and Juuso Lehtiniemi drank the 6-5-winning goal.
The two teams had to play decisive minutes in the ice.
JOSBA's most powerful was Juuso Lehtoniemi (2 + 1).
The second chain was also efficient, when Teemu Tukkanen (1 + 1), Jere Kaarinen (1 + 0) and Jere Kettunen (1 + 0) were hit.
Miika Koonenkin (1 + 0) played in the second chain at the time of the birth.

In the church on Sunday, 200-year anniversary
The 200 anniversary of the Church of Enonkoski is celebrated tomorrow on Sunday in some very sad mood.
The devastation of the church's arson week then was a shock.
Eno's church was guarded in the post-fire two night.
Despite the pain, today is still the place to celebrate.
Although no one would want to, Eno's church now has the oldest church in the Joensuu Parish group.
In the middle of the churchyard the village has always been a heart of Eno despite all the municipalities and other joints in the world.
The family fair starts at Enonkoski in the church today at 10 a.m.
Then we move to the congregation house around a Karelian holding table.
The program has all sorts of things both indoors and outdoors throughout the day.
For example, the church building can be explored with the guidance of Ari Räsäsen, a retired, 37 year-old parish master.
The church's birth celebration also marks the end of one era.
Already decommissioned, the parish house, built in 1982, will keep its doors open today for the last time.
Now there is a dodge in the premises of a former municipal house, "says Markku Koistinen, chaplain.
The parish house destroyed the internal air problems, but the church has stood healthy in place for that 200 year.
Elon Musk gives way to the Chair of the board of Tesla-fraud charges were agreed on 40 million dollars
The electric car manufacturer Tesla, and the company's president and CEO, Elon Musk, have agreed to their lawsuit with the U.S. Securities Market Authority, the SEC.
SEC doubted that Musk was guilty of fraud, and Musk was in danger of being sidelined due to the company he founded.
However, Musk may continue as managing director of Tesla.
Instead, Musk will have to give way to the Chairman of the Board of Tesla for three years.
The company is required to recruit the external board chairperson.
Musk is also subjected to stricter control.
According to the agreement, Tesla will have to employ two independent directors to further monitor Musk's communications.
In addition, Tesla and Musk pay both 20 million dollars (approximately EUR 17 million) for the reconciliation of the case.
"The decision is designed to prevent new market failures and the disadvantages of Tesla's shareholders," says Steven Peikki, director of the Seca.
The incident originated in August, when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might withdraw the company from the stock exchange.
Musk also wrote that the company's funding is secured.
At the moment, Tviitti raised Tesla's share rate.
SEC doubted that Muski was guilty of fraud.
According to the agency, the Tviitti was false and misleading, and Musk had not talked about the arrangement with other management or potential donors.
In practice, the agency accused Musk of misleading investors.
The SEC announced on Friday that he was challenging the company and Muskin Justice.
The SEC said he would insist that Musk be sentenced to fines and prohibited from operating in the management of listed companies.
It was a challenge for the Sec to be scared by investors, and Tesla's share went into a sharp decline.
An earthquake in Indonesia and tsunami dead over 800 people
In the earthquake in Indonesia and in the ensuing tsunami, the number of deaths has risen to at least 832, says the country's disaster agency's news agency, according to the AFP.
The number of deaths is still expected to increase as the disaster is being resolved.
According to Vice-President Jusuf Kallan, the final figure could rise to thousands.
The Friday earthquake raised the tsunami, which hit the town of Palu on the island of Sulawesi.
The tsunami was given immediately after the quake warning, however, which was promptly canceled.
According to the authorities, almost all known deaths are at least for the time being.
The rescue authorities are concerned, among other things, about the area of Donggala, the centre of the earthquake, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Even now, several people are known to have died.
Rubble of requests for assistance
The Indonesian Army has been alerted to rescuers to help find victims.
In the affected area today, the president either Widodon urged the soldiers to continue their rescue efforts without being exhausted day and night.
One of the central points of the rescue work is the hotel, which is still believed to be 50-60 people in the ruins.
Muhammad Syaugi, head of the agency for rescue work, reported that the ruins of the Roa-Roa hotel, which was favored by business travellers, were one person alive in the night.
We also heard people's requests for help, he said.
According to Syaug, heavy clearing equipment would quickly be dug into the earthquake and tsunami areas.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find missing loved ones.
Please help, you in the fire and nearby.
Friends of my family still missing, one author appealed to the Facebook group.
Politicians ' telephone numbers leaked into the hands of griefers in the UK
Many British politicians were harassed when their contact information was leaked due to shortcomings in the application's encryption.
Among other things, the telephone numbers of the ministers were accessed by the Troublei.
This was the application used by the government in the British Conservative Party congress.
For example, the Minister for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Mr Gove, and former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, are being harassed by BREXIIT.
Several members of the MPs received harassment calls.
Due to the lack of encryption in the app, the audience was able to access the politicians ' profiles at the Conservative Party's annual mobile app.
The public got access to profiles using the politician's email address. Which was readily available online.
To log in to the profile, you could watch and edit the content stored in the profile.
Someone managed to change the profile picture of Boris Johnson for a moment and to be a soloist of the title.
Michael Goven's profile was changed to the image of media mogul Rupert Murdoch.
The Guardian's columnist Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that the meeting application allows you to sign in to other people's profiles using these email addresses.
The login can then view the contact information for the profile person and, for example, send messages in this name.
The meeting application made the phone number of every journalist, politician and participant public, Foster criticized.
A Conservative spokesman asked for the information to be excised.
He said that technical problems have been solved and the application is now working safely.
The British authority ICO supported data leakage.
The application was prepared by the Australian company Crown Comms.
The opposition Labour Party criticises the fact that the Conservative Party cannot be trusted in security matters.
Every week, the Wall Finnish quiz audience has a large number of pating poles
Eye-catching viewers drew attention to The response of The Wall Finnish quiz show to The studio audience.
In The world of fast-spreading American format, The Wall landed in The Finnish version for Nelonen last Saturday.
The game show, hosted by Heikki Paasonen, is filmed in Poland in the same studio, where other international productions are made in the format.
In the Polish studio, the possibilities for shooting were exceptional, as the format of the Big 12 metre-high game wall demanded space for the farm.
During the initial period, the social media revealed the programme's studio audience, which was veisted.
On Twitter, there was a debate about whether the studio might sit in a game of Polish in Finnish.
Unne Sormunen, head of Nelonen domestic programs, illuminates the issue with the evening newspaper.
He tells us that the studio audience is the players ' close-up, other Finns, expatriates in Poland, and just the poles.
The audience is made up of international tapeters in Finnish production, as well as The audiences of other countries in The same production space.
In Finland, too, there are such piglets, so-called professional audiences, who go to the descriptions of the various programmes, with the background of Sormunen.
He reminds us that playing a game in itself is not so difficult to comprehend, even if it doesn't understand the language in which it is played.
It is easy to distinguish between the red and green balls.
In the foreign language studio, however, there are interpreters who manage the translation work.
There are two interpreters, who, as simultaneous interpreters, interpret the studio-instructor all the time events.
And the studio instructor will then instruct the audience and tell you what kind of flap there, for example, is thrown and what the situation is going, Sormunen says.
He compares the situation with the way in which David Hasselhoff recently acted in domestic production.
David Hasselhoff was a few years ago involved in Talent Finland's photo shoots in Finland.
He became a simultaneous interpretation of the ear, and he knew all the descriptions were spoken in Finnish, Sormunen sums up.
Southern parts of Japan Murjonut typhoon progresses towards the main islands-authorities warn against landslides and floods
The authorities also warn of possible landslides and floods.
At least 50 people have been injured in the typhoon Trav, but according to the authorities, there are avoidable of large injuries and no information is available to death casualties so far.
On the southern Okinawa island, the wind has been so harsh that it has turned the cars around.
According to the NHK broadcaster, people have been evacuated to shelter, and electricity has been broken by more than 300 000 households.
Over a thousand flights have been cancelled and the bullet trains are in some places at a standstill due to a storm.
The storm is expected to hit Osaka near noon in the Finnish time.
The capital city of Tokyo is not directly on the storm route, but there are also harsh winds and rainfall.
Trains have been cancelled today in Tokyo.
According to meteorological scientists, the Trami torment Japan until Monday.
The skies of aces even more gloomy
The early age of aces has been bad.
The sky was almost out of sync when the team lost on Saturday at home on Vaasa Sport 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1).
The Pori now has five consecutive losses, with a total of two points in the six rounds.
No ACE-defender or two lower-chain players have yet scored.
The pressures are also increasing all the time.
The crowd was already at the stage when the game was nearly half the time.
Six games are just played, and there is of course no reason to resign.
Of course, we must be worried, because we are so weak in our fears.
Especially in the second installment, the performance was shameful, with Aces 1 + 2 made by Jarno Kärki.
A victory for the sport naturally tasted.
The team had a flying game from Friday, so it would have thought to be visible.
Perhaps it appeared, but aces couldn't be exploited.
The number of visitors to the bread Day continued to
The mother of Bread Day Pirkko Hyvärinen wonders about the audience of the event in the Big Hall grandstand.
Somehow, it was thought that perhaps this year the crowd would come, Hyvärinen wonders this morning.
In the autumn of 2017 the SM-liiga was held at the same time as the bread day, so perhaps the expectations would be that the audience could even be slightly lowered from the previous year.
The other way, however, happened; The corridors were getting clogged before ten, the sellers reported that the products were exhausted, the news porridge was sold more nearly 500 servings, and in the number of cars Hyvärinen heard there was a rise.
The estimated number of visitors has been around 6000, Hyvärinen says later in the afternoon.
For the first five hours of the morning and afternoon, there was a special programme for Families with children, which would entice them to record much of the show.
In addition, Hyvärinen evaluates the event to reach a greater distance.
The sellers also bend the Liperin every year from a larger area.
This year, the rapporteurs, the sellers of handicrafts, pastries and harvesting products had arrived at almost one hundred bread keepers.
Mother of the bread Day PIrkko Hyvärinen admired the crowd in the hall.
The first day of the bread was blessed with harvest.
In the children's series Teija Kiviniemi's beautiful bread won the public vote.
In the children's bread competition, 11 different forms of bread arrived.
The winner of the Rye Bread Competition Marjatta Vepsäläinen spent a day in the Martha Pie Workshop.
7 x Most Beautiful lamp-here you'll recognize a good lamp
Bring your room to life, create the right atmosphere for your interior and read the book without getting tired of your eyes.
You should invest in good lighting.
We gathered together three good reasons to invest in lighting.
The tips were delivered by Finnish sales and marketing director Tarja Jokiniemi.
Make a favor for your eyes
The greater the importance of illumination, the more the ages are behind.
Sufficient light can be used to help with problems that many become with age when the visual acuity decreases and more and more glare is affected.
Vanhemmiten also increases the need for light.
The Sixties needs a light three times more than their twenties.
So, for health reasons, you should invest in the effects of light and the characteristics of the luminaire.
A good lamp gives enough light, but does not dazzle, River Peninsula tips.
Create a beauty around you
The beautiful interior is only accessible with the right lighting solutions.
At the moment the decorator can afford to choose.
It is popular with the Japanese style, which unites the scandinavianism and Japanism.
On the other hand, the modern and playful retro style inspired by the 70, with its strong colours, different shades of metal or ice-cream colors, has risen to the boom.
Authenticity fascinates in the same way as in other home interiors.
The materials now appear in wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Be a joy to your personality
On the other hand, more is being invested than before, and the interior has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, your own home wants a tailor-made, bold lamp with a story to tell.
People are clearly searching for Finnish and Scandinavian products whose origins and designers are known.
So we are very design conscious, Jokiniemi says.
The home is not necessarily the latest trend lamp, but a timeless classic that has been saved for many years.
Certain timeless, rustic and elegant classics keep their guns from one year to the next, says Jokiniemi.
Thank you and goodbye!

The game's specialty gaming man currently recycles not only games but also packaging materials.
The products of the stone-foot shop are no longer packaged in plastic bags, but paper bags made from recycled material.

All packages coming to us will go to the recycling.
We may use the boxes for a dozen or so times, as long as the package is in the condition that it can be used, says Ville Puurula Oulu's game man.
As an alternative to padding, the company uses newspapers and similar recycled material as a rule.
The bubble wrap is avoided as far as possible.
In the near future, we are supposed to move to recycled material.
The business wants to set an example for others.
Recycling is not an extra effort.
There is no big problem to start to recycle.
There will be economical savings, for example, when the cardboard cartons are used as new.
Recycling is a natural way of playing the game man's activities, as in addition to the new products, the main product range includes used games and equipment.

The action of sabotage by Russian intelligence services has a long tradition
There is no reason to suppose that the Russian Federation's foreign inquiry SVR or military intelligence GRU would have abandoned this modus operandi.
During the Soviet period, the activities of sabotage were specialised by the so-called DRG groups.
The name comes from the Russian-speaking words Diversionno-Razvedyvatelnaja Gruppa: Sabotage and intelligence Group.
The Western Ombudsmen in the west of the USSR are completing detailed plans for the important sabotage of the destinations, says the archivist in the west of the KGB, Vasili Mitrohin (1922-2004).
His information was published in Christopher Andrew's books at the end of 1990 and in the early 2000
The destinations were ports, shipyards, large dams, oil refineries and gas pipeline connections.
In Germany, KGB acquired the "DRG" for the Bundeswehr, railways, game guards and road workers uniforms and accessories for covert operations.
This was used by Russian parachuting soldiers in Crimea in February 2014: They dressed in the local Ukrainian police riot gear, set up inspection stations from the peninsula to Ukraine, and isolated the Crimea.
In the Cold War, the during agents hid the sabotage for groups of supply kits with mines, explosives, lighters and communications equipment.
In 1998, the KGB was found in Switzerland and the ansamiinoite exploded when the authorities sprayed it with a water cannon.

A true story today on TV: a climber left for death twice
The American Beck Weathers wrote 18 years ago a book.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on the man's own experiences.
The film of the evening is made based on them.
Everest will now be premiered on Finnish TV.
In May 1996, a devastating snowstorm surprised climbers at Mount Everest.
The control of Baltasar Kormákuri's 2015 is about a struggle for survival, which has been treated as a very lively one.
The tragedy has been done in movies-and documentaries-before.
True events are also being conducted in this story.
22 years ago, the world's tallest mountain took eight climbers ' lives.
Two of them were experienced leaders of the expedition: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It was Hall that served as a guide to Weatheri.
The spirit of the Weatheri was able to save the eye surgery taken before departure to Nepal.
As a result of its and atmospheric pressure, he lost sight, which is why the peak conquest had to be missed.
Rob Hall continued his journey and no longer returned.
Weatheri's struggle for life and death had only just begun.
As the storm rises he was lost and no longer found back in the camp.
When the men came to search, he was found in such poor condition that the survival was not entrusted.
Weathers left for death.
Miraculously, however, he was still on his feet and found the others.
Badly-healed weatheri were thought to be still dying and once again he was left to fend for himself.
It is clear that contrary to other expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, the climbers began to believe in the possibility of being given assistance.
In the movie Beck Weathersia is made by Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer of Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley, and Emily Watson.

ENO's 200-year-old church is celebrated today on the Church Hill.
The church was inaugurated on 4 December. On October 1818, and in celebration of the Jubilee year, Sunday was prepared for the whole family celebration.
The celebrations started at 10 a.m. on the Church hill at the family Fair, after which there was a Karelian holding table in the city of Eno's Parish hall.
The church was full.

It is a great pleasure for a long time and gives strength to work, Iron Mountain (pictured) says.
The fire of the Church of Kiihtelvaara has touched many and was not overlooked in the 200 anniversary celebration of Eno Parish.

Pictures and videos: The Mediani flashed might in Greece-the sea disappeared and the street turned into a river
A powerful hurricane-type autumn storm rolled on Saturday from southwest to Greece.
The Medikhan is a Mediterranean hurricane named Zorbe.
The Greek Meteorological Institute has issued a red weather warning for Attica, the Peloponnese, the Ionian Islands, the Cyclades and Crete.
Images captured in the area show plenty of flooding around Greece.
A video published on Twitter shows how between the houses of Kiaton in the Korinthian region suddenly appeared instead of the street due to the flooding in the river.
The second video shows how the car has been subjected to flood-water transport.
In the southern part of the Peloponnese peninsula the harsh wind caused strong sea shipping.
The Embassy of Finland in Athens instructs people on their Facebook pages to prepare for a storm in Greece.
The delegation calls for the monitoring of weather reports and local authority guidelines.
A Mediterranean hurricane, or a mediane, brings with it heavy rainfall and even a flood hazard.
According to the Cnn's study, a 2011 published in the survey shows that medians only occur once or twice a year throughout the world, typically around September-October, when the sea temperature is still high.
The now-blowing storm left a flood of floods in Tunisia and Libya before continuing its journey to the north and towards Europe.
Concern in Greece has also been caused by refugee camps in islands such as Lesvos.
The thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in the camps are limited in scope to a decent shelter.
In summer, the areas devastated by the fires also fall under the storm in the surroundings of Athens.
The media was also raging in Greece last November.
We must not go to the sea, but the flights are still on schedule-in the Greek islands, which are threatened by the storm, thousands of Finns are currently vacationing
The sea excursions are canceled and you should be careful not to take any branches or other bulk stuff on top of the storm.
These guidelines have been distributed to fair 3 500 in Greece on holiday in Finland over the weekend.
The guidelines will be a necessity, because even the Zorbas-storm that is going up to the horrors of Pieksevän is predicted to be the Greek islands this weekend.
For example, near the island of Crete, the wind speed can rise up to 45 meters per second.
The weather is increasing in heavy rains.
All travellers who have travelled to Greece from Finland, and who have reported their phone numbers, have been warned of a hard-blowing SMS by tour operators.
In the air still sun and warmth
According to Inka Ikonen of the solar travel communications expert on Saturday, the holiday destinations are avoidable the worst in the evening.
For example, flights have landed and have risen according to the normal schedule.
Of course we are watching the situation all the time.
The safety above goes.
I supported the media update, Antonia Schroderus, says that their flight has also been on schedule.
We are constantly connected to our staff.
At least in Crete it was still calm, he told me on Saturday in early evening.
The most popular Greek islands, in Rhodes and Crete, currently have a total of more than 1 500 Finnish passengers.
In addition, a few hundred passengers are vacationing in smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm in the island of Kos is likely to reach on Sunday morning.
On the other hand on Saturday afternoon, Rhodes had been mocking the sun and the temperature of your pain to 27 º C, the Sun's Ikonen says.
Zorbis has been estimated to move to the next Turkish riesis, albeit with a slight relaxation.
We have already been in contact with Turkey and our staff there, and, for example, have checked the number of Finns who have been flying in Antalya, says Schroderus.

The vehicles are constantly senses around the environment with several sensors and assess whether the router is free.
If it is not, they will interpret the existence of an obstacle vehicle, a bicycle or, for example, a snowflake, says Harri Sanstamala, managing director of the robotic traffic development officer.
The robot cars run throughout the autumn three days a week: Tuesdays at 15.30, Wednesdays at 10-15 and Thursdays at 10-15.
The robot cars stop at six stops along the route and take passengers aboard.
Robotic car stops recognize stop markings.

Police are able to hunt in North Karelia and Savo
The police Department of Eastern Finland conducted a hunting control on Friday and Saturday with the Metsähallitus and the Finnish game Centre in North Karelia and Upper Savo, the Police department's batch correspondents told the social media on Saturday.
The main focus of supervision was on the legality and the promise of hunting.

The Mykönen leaves Turkey to follow the election of Syrian quota refugees
Minister of the Interior Kai Mykönen (ECR), travels in the coming days to Turkey to monitor the selection of quota refugees coming to Finland.
It has been decided to 530 Syrian refugees from Turkish refugee camps in Finland this year.
The choice of journeys is usually made twice a year, with representatives from the Immigration Office, the Ministry of Labour and the economy and the police.
The delegation is already in the process of conducting interviews in Turkey.
The Un Refugee Organisation (UNHCR) first chooses the candidate who is particularly vulnerable.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered to be particularly vulnerable in refugee camps, such as lone parent families, the disabled and the sick, women and children.
In Finland, more people are selected than in the quota, because in practice the part is left not to appear for different reasons.
He also meets with the Turkish Minister of Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu and the Syrian border NGOs.
The office also includes the Secretary of the Ministry of Interior Ilkka Salmi.
The talk of increasing the quota
Finland has already taken quota refugees since the 1970.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees a year.
The quota was 1 050 a year for a couple of years, but the government did not subsequently have the agreement to raise it.
The coalition has supported the lifting of the quota, but the project has been the last to fall on the blue resistance.
The prime Minister, Juha Sipilä (center), recently made a gradual increase of the quota to 1 500-2 000 people per year.
During this reign, the visit of the silent government is the first to be made by the Minister of the Interior to monitor the selection of quota refugees.
The previous ministers of the Interior, Petteri Orpo (ECR) and Paula Risikko (ECR), could move on to their new tasks before the visits were organised.
Finland receives a subsidy of EUR 10 000 from the Eu for each of the particularly vulnerable refugees.
Now let's go astray-no longer know whether to cry or laugh
In the last Saturday, Karjalainen reported a draft law amending the animal Welfare law.
The article gave the impression that, in principle, the draft law prohibits the keeping of all animals not specifically permitted by ministerial decrees, in relation to the production, pets or otherwise, in the context of business activities.
In other words, not all the animals mentioned in the regulation are prohibited in principle.
If the bill comes into law, it will mean that we are abandoning in Western democracies the general principle that the law specifically prohibits action which endangers the safety or good practice of society.
We are now in the process of imposing a ban on all activities to which the law or regulation does not expressly permit.
The change will cause nothing new to be tried, for example, in a business operation, and do nothing else until the law or regulation that approves it is adopted.
In general, the Government's activities in the preparation of the law have been weak.
If we now start from the path that, in Finland as a priori, everything is forbidden, which is not explicitly permitted, no longer knows whether to cry or laugh.
I have no doubt that the animal welfare law would require an update.
But the legislative project in this direction is not part of democracy.
Unfortunately, I am not very familiar with the Constitution, but I wonder whether it will accept such ' everything is forbidden by law or regulation '.
Hopefully there will be some sensible minister who will interrupt the progress of such a law project.

Status symbols do not attract friends-four facts about popularity
What makes man popular, charismatic or admired?
The researchers at the University of Sydney have analyzed the two types of "Cooluden", which are somewhat different in nature: the common Cooluden and, to that extent, the opposing dissident.
Attractively, there were a number of socially desirable features, according to the researcher's description: They were outward-looking, friendly, so-minded and competent.
For the dissidents, it was characterized by distance, independence, rebellion and distortion.
They thirst for experience and Piittasivat only a little from outside estimates.
Both types combined with good self-esteem and a steady sense of life.
The toughest role in the long run is not cool: high status in teens does not necessarily lead to success later in life.
This is how the US survey in Child Development published in 2014.
Young people, who were dating early, the party, were looking for good-looking piglets and striving for the favor of others, were at the risk of being used as young adults to use drugs and to drift into crimes.
In their relationships, they were more vulnerable than their once more discreet peers.
With high status, luxury cars, branded bags, or watches do not make it a coool-or at least not really tempting to follow.
In a study published in the "Social Psychological and Personality Science" in August, the majority of people were more prepared to make friends with a normal supermarket than a branded shirt-despite the fact that most The brand-shirt.

Nice round.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he left the solution round.
Feels good, shaking a bit even more, Botttas explained.
I have been on a pile only once this year, in Austria (in mid-summer), so time has passed quite a while.
This track has been good for me in the past, and I got again some good laps.
It's not easy to skip the track at the Sotshin, so the output is a particularly big role.
And, of course, Bottas was able to answer for a swim, whether he would drive for a victory tomorrow, or whether the front of the world Championship was approaching Hamilton's Jesus.
My starting point for the race is definitely that I try to win.
Not on the pile when leaving the other target may be, Bottas piles.
But in the stables we fight for both titles.
Lewis ' leadership Sebastian in the list is pretty big and the difference struck me very big, so it must keep in mind.
Let's see what happens, Bottas, however, complemented.
After the ride, Hamilton was genuinely happy with the success of Bottas, and the team-boss Toto Wolffin has been tasted.
Lewis had the intent to defeat Valtteri, but he did not manage to win in the bend.
Valtteri knows he has to rip all of himself to defeat Lewis.
And he was so charged, that the adrenaline of the purwolf from the ears out, Wolff annealed.
The question is whether the stables in Bottas and Hamilton were to be run by a soloist, Wolff was forced to dodge.
We will be discussing tomorrow morning, and we will see how the race departs.
The Finnish Championships
The SM-sarja for rally car ended rarely.
Almost never before, the brothers have ended up as champions of Finland at the same time.
Now it was decided by the Tuusula Eerik and Henrik Pietäinen in a rally around Turku and Salo, as Eric won the SM1 and Henrik SM2 classes.
He made the best achievement in his career when the third place in the final race sealed him the Finnish championship in the SM4 class of two-wheel drive cars.
With Honda Civic's rival Kinnunen and co-driver Ville Mäkelä started the Turku race with Maltilla, as the starting points were clear: the ranking in the top group would guarantee the SM title.
In the darkness of the Friday night, the duo was forced to give a handicap when some of the extra lights were deceived by another special test.
It made the time blind in a third clip.
In such a situation, it is inappropriate.
On Saturday, the second series was Jussi Tepon's momentum, Kinnunen said.
Syria urges the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops
The Syrian foreign Minister calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
Foreign Minister Walid Muallem, who spoke at the Un General Assembly on Saturday, says that foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and unconditionally.
Muallem said that foreign troops are in Syria fighting against terrorism, and the war against terrorists is ' almost over '.
In his UN speech, Muallem also appealed to Syrian refugees that they would return to their home country.
However, there is no end to the seven-year-old war.
Over 360 000 people have died in war.
On Friday, Chancellor Angela Merkel told Germany that a meeting in Syria was planned for October, involving the presidents of France, Russia and Turkey.
Not quite Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans looked at the Supreme Court judge drama on TV
The judge of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, and Professor Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of harassment, received an exceptionally large number of people.
In the United States, the drama of the Supreme Court, which is full of power, received at least 20 million people in the television on Thursday.
At the time, Mr. Kavanaugh, a Californian professor in charge of the harassment of Donald trumpet, were in front of the Senate Justice Committee to tell their story.
According to preliminary results, the consultations followed the following six main channels: ABB, Cbs, Cnn, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC with a total of 20.4 million spectators.
Their addition to online consultation followed a further number of millions more.
On the record, NBC reported that 6.8 million people followed, and CNN reported a year's high score of 8.2 million live broadcast.
The number of Cnn's rises to more than 10 million, when you count on YouTube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital also reached 8.0 million starting.
Digital startups are the channels ' own, TV viewers are sourced from research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen publishes final readings on Monday, but they are in any case staggering.
Few reach 20 million
In the United States, more than 20 million viewers are usually only sporting matches, and the major Academy Awards and Grammy Awards for the entertainment world, as well as occasional political events such as speeches by presidents and in 2016 also Presidential debates.
In the USA's most watched program, the NFL Football League final match for Super Bowl is certainly a journey.
This year, the Super Bowl gathered on the NBC channel about 103 million people.
Last year, trumpet's first speech to Congress was, according to Nielsen, a total of nearly 48 million people and the inauguration of over 30 million people.
Top priority
The judge of the Supreme Court is an extremely important case in the USA, as the posts are lifelong.
Trump already named one new judge when Anton's Scalia died in early 2016 and the Republicans succeeded in preventing the then President Barack Obama from appointing his successor.
The second place was helping when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced this year to retire.
Kennedy was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, but on several issues he was the so-called scales language, whose voice was able to resolve the nine-intellectual court's position.
He was a supporter of the right to abortion and the rights of LGBT and, for example, in 2015, it was his voice to resolve the same-sex marriage law throughout the federal state.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative than its positions.
His election to the Supreme Court may lock the right of the conservative overpower for decades.
Children have the right to their knowledge of parents
Only parents of children under the age of 10 see their children's health information on the loyalty service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong and it's strange.
Originally, the situation of the loyal service was, of course, even more worrying: the parents were not able to look at even the little health information or recipes.
In the autumn of 2016, a temporary characterisation was obtained for children under 10 years of age.
Since then, the practice has been promised to be corrected, but it has been an amazingly long time to repair.
Now the repair is in store-in 2020.
As the problem is clear, changing the legal basis should not have been more than an exclamation point.
After that, a layman's understanding is about a button press: Now that the wire is closed, it is opened.
A child may, of course, show their information to their parents-if they have bank IDs or an official ID card.
But how many 10-years is it?
The ID card is for a fee, and the bank codes for the 10-year-old are not even allowed.
In practice, the four-grader information in the primary school cannot be seen by anyone except by asking them when they are printed.
It is not so much a question of parental rights as the right of children.
For the care of the child, it is extremely important that parents can participate in it.
Of course teenagers ' right to privacy must be taken care of.
Minors, too, can have family situations where all matters cannot be freely spoken.
Often they are related to sexual health, from which free care is a deeply relevant human right.
In the United States, the FBI began to crash the harassment allegations
According to the American media, the FBI is investigating allegations of harassment by at least two women.
The second of the women was heard earlier this week by the Senate Justice Committee.
Kavanaugh has denied accusations regarding alleged sexual harassment of his study once.
U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the FBA to investigate allegations at the request of the Senate Justice Committee.
The statement shall not take longer than a week.
Washington Post says it is a more limited explanation of criminal investigation, and it does not necessarily become public.
A man threatened to kill cops in the police station in Kajaani
The captured brawl also continued to be a bottle.
The police tell us to put a man in the police prison to "settle down".
The police were subjected to the threat of a suspected assault on Saturday night in Kajaani.
The authority informs the incident that originated when a fair 30-vutias man challenged violently the dispute at the Central restaurant.
The man first assaulted another customer within the nutrition movement.
This resulted in the removal of the restaurant.
An open-air fighter attacked another man on top of pouring him into the ground.
When the third party tried to miss, the man still hit him.
Triple Assault led to the call of the police.
The patrol took the man and took Kajaani to the police station, says the police.
The suspect behaved at the police station still aggressively.
The man kicked another police officer on the leg.
He threatened to kill and assault cops.
The police tell us that they are being taken to a man's police prison for "calm down".
The man is on suspicion of three assaults and the violent suppression of an official.
Relief organizations are preparing to start work in Indonesia's Sulawesi-"clean water is it's most urgent"
The United Nations Children's organisation UNICEF and other international relief organisations are on hand to assist on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, says Kirsi Haru, Finnish UNICEF information manager.
Local authorities are leading the rescue work, but the need for additional assistance is already evident at this stage.
UNICEF operates in almost all countries, and we also have long-standing programmes in Indonesia.
In addition to normal operation, UNICEF always has a full emergency preparedness, says Haru.
The first task now is to find people in the rubble, both survivors and dead.
In the town of Palu in Sulawesi, the rescue operations are underway, but the situation in the Donggala region slightly farther north is less pronounced.
There are still places where connections are not working.
The interventions are difficult because the roads too are cut, says Haru.
The buildings are often lightweight in Sulawesi, so the earthquake and tsunami damage are great.
Once the survivors have been found, they need protection – next to the top for example tents – and clean water.
Clean water is in crisis situations it's most urgent.
The first is that people are usually able to offer the water purification tablets that UNICEF has in store.
Water systems are designed to be corrected as soon as possible, but in emergency cases water is transported to the first time, for example, by the rails.
In times of crisis many children are forced to get rid of their parents.
Finding family members and family reunification is one part of UNICEF's field of activity.
Food aid is organised by the World Food Programme (WFP), which is part of the United Nations.
Early-stage emergency aid is used for previously collected funds.
UNICEF, however, has already begun fundraising to help victims of the earthquake in Indonesia and the tsunami.
Billionaire Elon Musk concludes as chairman of Tesla board-$20 million in tweets
The founder of the Space Rockets and electric vehicles company Elon Musk avoids fraud charges with the Us Securities Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk terminates its role as chairman of the Board of the electric car company Tesla and agrees to the $20 million in fines.
Musk gives way to the task as part of an agreement that he concluded with the Us authority for securities markets.
By agreeing to Musk avoid fraud charges.
The Us Securities Commission, the SEC, threatened to black with securities fraud because of the tweets he sent in August.
In them, Musk wrote that he was preparing the withdrawal of the electric vehicle company Tesla from the stock exchange, which led to a rapid rise in the company's share price.
According to the agreement, Musk shall not be the Chairman of the Board of Tesla for three years.
In addition, Tesla must appoint a new "independent member" to its government and take on two "independent directors" of its management team.
Tesla must also set up a committee to monitor the Black communications.
Musk is still allowed to continue as CEO of Tesla.
In addition to Black's personal $20 million, the Tesla company has to pay the equivalent of 20 million to the financial controller.
Tweet
According to the SECC, the Musk's tweets led to investors and the Tesla shareholders were misled.
Musk argued that he would have secured the funding to buy Tesla from the stock Exchange back to a private limited company.
According to the billionaires ' tweets, the company would have been bought off the stock exchange for a 420 dollar share price.
Tesla's share price rose by more than 10 per cent a day after the tweets, but declined later.
According to the SECC, there was no basis for Muski's arguments.
According to the supervisor, he had not actually negotiated the financing he claimed.
Nor had he discussed withdrawing from the stock exchange with the rest of the management team or the Board of Directors.
This Friday's course fell 14 percent, when the securities officer of the SEC reported fraud charges.
The news agreement is expected to re-confirm the company's course.
The Last Judgement is not the reason
The Cathedral bells do not naturally ring when the hands are not moving.
This is a technical defect.
The Helsinki Cathedral Tower clock has stalled.
The five are shown at 12 o'clock.
The situation is like a mediocre horror film: Yet when the crypt of the church would be exorcism and the organ would be heard by himself.
This, of course, is not the time, but it has stopped because of a technical reason: it has gone out.
It has been seen by the repairman, but a part of it has been broken and is expected to be a new part, says Suntio Jamsen.
At the same time Jamsen confirms the church in Helsinki-a Twitter account already mentioned.
The account mentions that the last Judgment is not a reason to stop the clock.
Jamsen explains that church bells are not ringing due to a defect.
