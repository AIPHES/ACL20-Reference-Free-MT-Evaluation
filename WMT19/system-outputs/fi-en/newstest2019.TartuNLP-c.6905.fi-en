Eemeli Kouki led to Hurricane's home victory in the opening - Savo Volley's second victory
Seven times in a row, the men's flying ball at Mestaruusliigan's medals had Hurricane-Loima started the season 2018-19 with a cotivo, when Raision Loimu crashed 3-0 on Saturday.
Overall player Eemeli Kouki, who returned from Romania to Finland, was 22 points the most effective in Hurricane.
There were some recitals abroad, but they didn't come true, and then came a play from Loimaa.
Time quickly got hommat agreed, Kouki said.
Like Kouki, Loimussak's played Tomi Rumpunen backed Kouk with 18 points.
The most effective of the guests was Samuli Kaislasalo, who played with a match-to-match contract at 17 points.
Opening game victory is always important.
Many players had experience against each other, and it brought a further streak into the game.
Our game isn't ready yet, but the continuation of the meter pipeline is of course a goal, Kouki said.
Määttänen Savo Volley's most effective
Miro Määttänen was 18 points Savo Volley's most effective when the team fell in Vieremä with Vantaa Ducks 3-0.
Our game was splendid, especially at the end of the attack, but thankfully we got a purged victory.
I didn't have any knowledge of a different charge when I played against my former team, Määttänen said.
Antti Siltala, who started his 2000-01 career in Vieremä's Lentopallo 3-series, scored 12 points.
Head coach Jukka Tuovinen was happy with many things.
Halli was small, i.e. a tunnel in the roof all the time.
A good fiilis missed a home invasion.
Miro was kunkku, Sillikin played a good game, Tuovinen said.
Siltala's previous season in the league was 2006-07, when she won silver in St. Petersburg's Sammos while Tuovise was then the head coach.
Thiago Maciel was Ducks' most effective 14 points.
Mikkonen again star of Akaa-Volley
In the 2012-13 season, Joni Mikkonen, who won the league's points exchange, has started this season strongly.
The hacker scored 25 points when Akaa-Volley took his opening win of the season after crashing Kokkola's Tiikerit 3-2.
The season has begun from its own point of view.
Today was certainly a defeat nearby, because we were fourth in a loss of 17-21.
There was something scorched, and the fifth batch came in at the same time, Mikkonen said.
A few seasons ago, the most effective animals still in the finals were 28 points scored by hackers Edvarts Buivids.
Earthman Aleksandrs Kudrjashovs backed 17 points.
Nothing could be taken into the guy's hack, Mikkonen praised.
Finland in comparison of human capital with the world's individual
"Finland is at the forefront of the world in comparing human capital," says Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
During the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years, Finland was the individual of the statistics.
In 2016, the tip was almost the same as in 1990.
Previously, Iceland, Denmark, Canada and Holland were among Finland's.
Later, Holland ranked one higher and instead of Canada, Taiwan was found on the list.
In 2016, Niger and South Sudan were ranked among the worst in comparison.
Measuring human capital will look at levels of education in the population, access to education, skills and health.
The World Bank has lined human capital to be linked to economic growth.
Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois held Atletico's kuris, the local game ended as unpainted
Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois stretched into the parade, and the Madrid teams' local game ended in a goalless tasape late on Saturday in the Spanish football league.
From Atletico Madrid, Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were closest to goal, but the Belgian star Courtois ehtoi to fight.
Courtois played in Atletico through three loan games while being Chelsea's player.
Early in the week, Fifa, the International Football Association, chose him as a goalkeeper of the year.
In Realis, Gareth Bale achieved the best paint spot, but his shot was headed past the end of the goal's opening season.
Bale missed the exchange after the break because of a thigh injury.
According to ESPN, disappointed Real's supporters shouted the name of Cristiano Ronaldo, a painter who moved to Juventus.
Us is now attacked against abortion law - a powerful document explains why
The U.S. Senate is currently trying to figure out whether Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate nominated by President Donald Trump, could be elected one of the Supreme Court's nine members.
In the Republican Party, many hope that Kavanaugh's crucial voice would repeal a well-known decision against Roe, known as Wade, that made abortion in the U.S. legal in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's documentary Reversing Roe - USA and abortion rights tells how the current situation has come over the years.
As incredible as it seems, the subject is timely in Finland too.
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (sin) has done a publicity campaign against safe abortion and has received support from the vast majority of our country's representatives from different levels.
At the beginning of the powerful documentary, you will meet the gynaecologist Colleen McNicholas, who has remained the only doctor who performs abortions in the state of Missouri due to the tightening of the laws.
The clinic's armed guard tells him to defend U.S. religious freedom.
News videos recall killing terrorist attacks in clinics.
Moving to a time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
The union of Lutheran churchgoers mentored at the time to create reliable abortion doctors for women.
The arguments of the interviewed pastor are good, but actually they don't even need them, a photograph of the woman who died of abortion herself is enough.
There were about 5000 deaths in the U.S. a year.
Abortion legalisation was defended, particularly by the Republican Party.
Already in 1967 in California, the abortion law was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan.
It was later that Reagan, during his campaign for presidential elections in 1980, began to confuse religion with politics to haalise voters.
His Aborttikantan was also rounded up by his successor George Bush's parents.
And Donald Trump did the same.
At the deepest heart of the matter, the documentary boasts of looking for a basis for politicizing abortion.
When tax exemption was refused from religious organisations in favour of racial separation, they became politically active.
Abortion was chosen as Keppihevo.
Religion has brought exceptional knots to politics.
Writing this in the USA, there is a situation in which the president, who tapped on his abortion channel with his sexual harassment, has chosen the Supreme Court candidate Kavanaugh 'n which is now accused by several women of sexual harassment.
Kavanaugh may gain vaa'anglish-based power to decide the rights of 164 million American women and girls.
Israeli army shot seven Palestinians, among two children - big demonstrations on the border
About 200 Palestinians have been killed in half a year, when Israel has brought protesters to the border zone.
On Friday, Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians in Gaza's border zone, the Palestinian Ministry of Health reports.
Among those killed are two children, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health: boys aged 12 and 14.
According to the ministry, 505 people have been wounded.
Of these, 89 were wounded.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened fire and made the border zone a climate when protesters threw Israeli troops with stones and explosives.
The army says it's started using force that protesters don't break down the boundaries or try it to the other side.
At least 191 Palestinians have died in Gaza's demonstrations since March, when Palestinians began weekly demonstrations at the border.
There are 12,000 vulnerable, according to the UN Human Rights Commissioner.
Protesters demanded Palestinian families access to areas where Palestinians had to leave when the Israeli state was founded in 1948.
One Israeli soldier has been killed by a Palestinian observer.
Explosives dropped by kite and helium balloons from the Palestinian side have ignited forest areas and cultivated land in Israel.
Teemu Pukki hankki punishmentspotkun - failed to fire himself
Wigan's toppari Chey Dunkley appeared to have crashed him back with a fireplace in the penalty area.
Resignation judge Gavin Ward allowed the game to continue.
According to his interpretation, the tale was pure.
Teemu Pukki couldn't believe his eyes.
The situation should remain troubled by resignation judge Wardia, who sentenced Norwich to 85 minutes of punishment when Pukki was crashed.
Ward looked punished, and Mario Vrancic scored a 1-0 winning goal.
The puck has scored five goals for Norwich in Mestaruussarja.
The previous one was born last Saturday against QPR with a stylish breast muscle.
Labour tasted again for Pukille.
After the ball was lost, he continued until the end of the situation.
He created landslides and defended tirelessly.
For Norwich, the match was fifth in two weeks.
The team continues in the liigacup.
There's a five-win tube behind.
Paedophile assistance service immediately completed bookings - In Finland, about 40,000 experiences interest in children
It is estimated that two per cent of men and a small proportion of women experience at least some sexual interest in my brotherhood.
In Finland, this means about 40,000 people.
Until now, it has been difficult for those interested in children or young people sexually to get help.
The joint SeriE project of the Criminal Care Support Foundation and Sexpon trains professionals to meet paedophiles as customers and helps people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was reported in the spring, Sexpossa, which offers advice and therapy, began an e-mail and meeting times were reserved very quickly to the end, Yle tells.
But these are promised to be released in autumn.
Sexual preference for children causes many to be ashamed.
Most of the paedophile feelings in themselves have not accomplished their fantasies and thus did nothing criminal.
But the preference is usually a permanent feature.
Most of them hope to get rid of those thoughts that annoy and massacre them.
They also hamper normal life, says Patricia Thesleff, a sexual therapist for Yle, who works as a specialist in the project.
In my opinion, work is valuable if one child is saved from sexual violence, Thesleff says.
Coreoiden leaders or a congolais gynecologist?
U.S. President Donald Trump as Nobel Peace Prize winner - the idea may sound strange, but Trump is one of the biggest favourites to win the prize based on betting odds.
Behind this is Trump's role in getting North Korea at least on the level of speeches to commit to nuclear disarmament.
The biggest favorites to peace Nobel have been told by South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who have already met three times this year and promised to seek a peace deal. entre ses États.
The temperature between the corées is considerable, as still last year the midterms were good.
Nonetheless, rewarding Kim, who has been threatened for many years by nuclear weapons, and leading the country on iron, would undoubtedly raise criticism as well.
Nobel Prize winners will be announced as of Monday, and Friday will be the highest attention received, or the Peace Prize.
If the prize is not awarded to those involved in the Korean peninsula diplomacy, there is one candidate congolais doctor Denis Mukwege.
In his hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo, an appreciated gynaecologist has treated thousands of women victims of mass rapes and emerged as a leading expert in his field in the world.
Mukwege has attracted attention during his work to sexual violence, which is a crimson by-product of many conflicts.
A strong candidate has also been considered the UN refugee association, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981.
The Nobel Committee has announced that this year there are 331 candidates.
The names of the candidates are not reported to the public.
Trump himself wouldn't panic if Nobelin got it.
In May, the journalist asked her at the White House whether she thought she deserved a peace award.
Everybody thinks it, but I wouldn't ever say it myself, Trump said with a smile.
I want to get this ready.
The prize I want is a victory for the whole world, the president continued to refer to the North Korea talks.
But there are things that make Trump's Nobel unlikely.
The award-winning Norwegian Nobel Committee has often given recognition to individuals and organisations representing liberal democracy and a diverse world order - precisely the kind of international cooperation that Trump opposes. has been seen.
In the 21st century, the prize has been awarded to three American politicians, all of whom have been Democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007 and Barack Obama in 2009.
So, rewarding Trump would demand an ideological full-scale from the Nobel Committee.
Fire announcement in tunnel: motorists behaved like garlics and drove in the wrong direction
The traffic chaos at Ykkösti Lohja took place on 8 September.
Due to the announcement, traffic in the tunnel area was cancelled in both the direction of Turku and Helsinki.
Lorsqu' il s' agissait d' une question systémique, l' établissement de combustion s' efforçait de transformer le trafic en normale.
But it didn't succeed very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Centre said it couldn't be opened, because there are motorists on the road and they're driving how to happen, daytime firefighter Pasi Kääriäinen told the freshness at the time for STT.
At the time, the motorway was started to drive even in the wrong direction just after a moment of waiting.
When the first starts running against traffic rules, a few others are often followed in succession, Tapio Heiskanen, the liaison chief executive responsible for traffic safety, is surprised.
According to traffic rules, motorways and tunnels shouldn't stop like forced reasons.
Traffic safety recalls that in exceptional circumstances it is impossible to leave to jeopardise traffic with emergency solutions.
Alarm vehicles must always provide the most accessible route possible.
Driving in the opposite direction on the motorway is, in particular, prohibited, as well as making an u translation and cancelling.
The same bans also apply in tunnels where, in addition, you always need to switch headlights on.
Stopping without compulsive cause is also prohibited, as is true when parking.
There have even been incidents in which the driver has stopped at the tunnel to brush snow from his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for that operation, Heiskanen says in the Transport safety briefing.
Ilves fans would have wanted to continue their celebrations, although the ship remained attached to the lake base
Ilves fans carried by inland waterway m / s Tampere would have liked to stay on board to continue their winning ceremony, though the ship had been stuck from its bow to the lake base, says the ship's chief executive at the time of the event. Juho Syrjä.
From Hämeenlinna to Tampere, m / s Tampere drifted away late on Saturday night, leaving his bow at the bottom of Vanajaved in Akaas.
19 passengers and five crew members were evacuated on the continent during the night.
Nobody was injured in a raven.
Ilves fans would have wanted to continue their celebrations on board until the morning, but it was true that it was more sensible to send them to port and bus home by fire facility, Syrjä said to STT.
Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna following Ilveksen and HPK's match, which ended in Ilveksen's 4-3 victory.
Remote, Saturday's haver was due to the fact that Vanajaved's water surface was about half a metre lower than normal.
Navigation was also complicated, according to Syrjä, by the fact that the closest badge was in the cover of logs, which is why its reflectors did not normally appear in dark causes.
No more mentioned collision
Haveri happened a little west of the narrow Jumusensalme after the naval route had crossed the motorway bridge between Tampere and Helsinki.
The greater drama was not associated with the incident, according to Syrjä, as the boat's pace was very low at the time of the event, and the fact that hitting the bottom did not cause a more mentioned collision.
The remote says that lagging on the ground has not caused ship leaks, nor pressures, and those visible ship cruises continue normally.
On Saturday morning, the divers went to check the ship's condition before the ship started priced out of the lot.
For reasons of certainty, we are still visiting the yard to verify that no harm has been caused by this, Syrjä says.
Syrjä believes the next m / s cruise in Tampere, booked next weekend, can be carried out in an arranged manner.
The cruise season of the ship continues, according to him, until the independence day.
No use for ambulance
On Saturday night, the rescue service received an alarm about half after twelve.
Ambulances were alerted to the port of Viiala to receive evacuated passengers, but there was no use for ambulances.
Daytime firefighter Matti Willman told late in the evening that the evacuation conditions on the lake were difficult because of the darkness and quite harsh winds.
The Pirkanmaa rescue service briefed half-three nights on Sunday against Sunday that all those on board had been evacuated and passengers were moved by bus to Tampere.
The cruiser, constructed in 1957, has been entrenched in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
Trump jury candidate accused of harassment and rying may remain without a peak
Brett Kavanaugh, presented as the judge of the U.S. Supreme Court, may well remain without his goal of a post, estimates programme director Mika Aaltola from the Foreign Policy Institute.
So far, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate use during their studies.
According to Aaltola, the doubts have brought so much political pressure to the Republican Party that President Donald Trump may end up putting someone else in office.
It has happened earlier then in the United States that the president's candidate as Supreme Court judge has provoked plenty of contradictions.
Then the jury candidate is usually withdrawn himself, says Aaltola.
That's how the president has been able to preserve his face.
The appointment would be a hundred democrats' laari
The U.S. Supreme Court is seeking to be above politics, but at least in Kavanaugh's case, the choice of a new judge has become a politically very sensitive process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, the decision will likely hunt Aaltola to the Democratic Party laari in the forthcoming interim elections in Congress.
It would increase voting intensity among young people and women, who would be more likely to vote Democrats.
On the other hand, appointing a conservative judge to the Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for the Republicans.
The occasion for appointment doesn't hit every presidential term, as Supreme Court judges in the United States are appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have abandoned their own request for retirement at the age of about 70-80.
From the Republicans, some hesitate to appoint
The U.S. Supreme Court jury candidate is normally subject to a background check, Aaltola says.
Although Trump has only imposed a week's deadline on the FBI's further investigation, it can still bring something essential to the fore, according to Aaltola.
Yes, it may bring.
Rarely is smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
According to Aaltola, the certainty is at least that Kavanaugh 's aptitude or inconvenience to the post will be discussed still lively before the Senate makes its decision.
The Republicans have a majority of 51-49 votes in the Senate, but at least two female Republican senators are thought to be suspicious of Kavanaugh's appointment.
The most intimidating thing would be that the appointment would be spent on the vote and the Republicans would disappear.
Woman identified Salisbury as an agent of military intelligence
The Russian woman has told the broadcaster BBC that she recognises Salisbury's poisonings as an agent of the suspected Russian military intelligence service.
Based on photographs, the woman told Anatoli Tshepiga, who works at GRU, it's a military inquiry.
Nettiyhteisö Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia previously told them they had revealed another of the suspected men were poisoned as Tshepig.
Earlier, they said they had found evidence that the men's present personalities were cover-ups.
The bbc group travelled to Kauko-Itää near the Russian-China border village, where Tshepiga seized.
The woman living in the village identified the young Tshepigan Bellingcat from the photos published.
He identified the same man from photos of the British police, featuring a man calling himself Ruslan Boshirov today.
Russians are suspected of poisoning former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter with Novitshok-hermomyrky in March.
The Skripals survived.
Eversti Tshepiga has been rewarded, among other things, with the Russian hero's honour in 2014.
Russia is still disputing the suspect's GRU link.
Men suspected of being poisoned earlier in September told Russia's TV interview they had been in Salisbury as tourists.
Old people as throw bags in war reform
A vivid example has now been obtained of what the Sipilä government's definition of a war reform restriction in practice means.
My synnyhood Vaalan sote services are producing Oulunkaaren municipal groupe, whose health service manager was elected Attendon's former regional director in 2016.
Leaders of the joint municipality warn the delegation of a change restrictor.
Should war spending now rise, the municipality's state aid will be cut in the future.
The municipality's centre-leaders strangled, and most of them are therefore ready for a major structural change in elderly care, which would put an end to the institutional care of the health centre's bedroom and the department of small mental illnesses.
Home care would be enhanced, meaning long distances in Vaala, that the elderly living in the remote village would be torn from the roots to be treated next to the health centre "at home."
Attendo relied that the municipality would pay it to customers.
Vaala's left didn't swallow a bad preparation, but organised a good audience ceremony, bringing together a lot of families, close nurses and other party delegates as well.
I presented in the diocese of Warsaw how the municipality of Vaala is treating the elderly at home for the most part throughout the northern Ostrobothnia.
Carina Läntinen, the neighborhood's mandate, was also involved.
The local magazine made a big jute for the occasion, while raising Oulunkaaren's manufacturers to their backs.
Sote manufacturers don't write on any paper that Attendo has built a new hoivakode in Vaala, which is now waiting for its empty residents.
There are no other service providers.
The manufacturers are just talking about the service list, but they don't tell what level of care it receives or what kind of staff structure Attendo is going to care for the elderly until safekeeping.
Without a nurse?
Because there's no doctor's overnight stay there, the health centre's establishments will be stopped.
Attendo is also going to resort to doctors at the health centre in Vaala.
Vaala's example illustrates how centre-based officials rotate authorized persons with insufficient information and authorized persons are punched against the wall at the change limit.
That's how the centre party empties the inhabitants of Vaala, because whoever stays there unsafe to live voluntarily if there's an opportunity to move away.
Was the centre one electoral sentence, that the entire country is considered resident?
Turkish President Erdogan opened the Grand Mosque in Cologne
In the city of Cologne in Germany, thousands of people demonstrated their opinion when Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a Turkish president visiting the country, opened the mosque of Europe's largest.
Several hundred people had been gathered on the Rhine beach as early as the morning.
Erdogan is not welcome, read in the villages of protesters, and the slogans condemned fascism.
Several demonstrations have been held during Erdogan's visit, which began on Thursday, and security measures have been rigorous.
In Cologne, about 10,000 people were expected to protest, including the human rights situation in Turkey, in advance on the streets.
Erdogan supporters had also been gathered for the Great Mosque neighbourhood.
But the police had isolated a large area from the mosque's surroundings for security reasons.
In his opening speech, Erdogan praised his visit to Germany for being successful and estimated the relationship between Germany and Turkey that had confirmed it.
During his visit, Erdogan met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
Erdogan and Merkel swore on Friday that they would rebuild relations between the countries, which have deteriorated significantly since Turkey's 2016 coup d'etat.
But Merkel stressed that there were deep disagreements between countries, including on human rights issues.
Criticism around the visit
Both Cologne's mayor Henriette Reker and North Rhine-Westphalia's prime minister Armin Laschet withdrew their involvement in the openers when criticism of Erdogan's visit accelerated.
Cansu, a 30-year-old student from Turkey, told him to come to a protest against Erdogan from Switzerland.
I want to be the voice of those who can't go to the streets in Turkey.
They have been arrested, killed and subjected.
For Erdogan, anything that differs from his own thinking is terrorism.
A significant proportion of the population is of Turkish origin in Erdogan's last stage of the German trip to North Rhine-Westphalia.
In Slovakia, three charges against journalist's murder
In Slovakia, three people have been prosecuted for the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
The prosecutor told on Friday that three people were accused of murdering Kuciak and this sparkling February as well as other crimes.
Earlier this week, police arrested eight people in the murder investigation, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak was found in February shooting with his sparkling home in Bratislava.
He had investigated the links between politicians and the Italian mafia.
Police have suspected murders related to Kuciak's investigation.
The case and the article published by Kuciak have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
Karjalainen's distribution may have problems in Sunday's shake-up areas
Due to the failure of the printing, Sunday's Karjalainen is also forced to be posted inadmissible.
This may be seen in the distribution of the magazine in detective areas, where distribution to co-boxes is forced to perform outdoor tests.
The situation was the same for Saturday's magazine, and the problem may continue on Monday.
The poster puts extra leaf bouquets in the province.
The rest of Finland's subscribers' magazines will not be sent separately until Monday.
The distribution of these journals is significantly delayed.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
Journalist Arto Nyberg will today interview directly in his upcoming discussion programme, including Vesa Heilala.
Vesa is in the studio to tell you about his coming space trip, which he booked from Virgin Galactica as early as 2010.
The price came to €151,000, which was needed to pay in bank loans.
If the original plans had kept their place, Vesa would have visited space quite a while ago.
But the day of departure has been postponed year after year.
It now appears that after the failure of a probationary flight, which happened in 2014, and after the victim's claim of the death penalty, things are on the verge.
If everything goes well, commercial flights will still start this year or next year at the latest.
Vesan's flight number is 300, i.e. his journey is timed about a year after the first departure.
The flight takes 2.5 hours and is 5 minutes at 100 kilometres altitude, a Finnish astronaut tells of his upcoming home page.
À la même adresse, she's also backdropping her excavation into space.
As a child, I read Avaruusmatka's cartoon magazine and saw Star Trek's series of televisions.
Star wars have been seen, and that's what the idea left to switch...
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a silent host
Manchester City continued its defeatless journey in Valioliigas as it fell on Saturday at Brighton's landing 2-0.
Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero will serve as guarantors of the ruling championship's sixth victory.
Sterling was allowed to steer his fourth hit of the season from nearby to empty paint when Leroy Sané found him in the 30th minute of Brighton's goal from the tailgate.
Agüero raised his own goalkeeper to five when he saw Sterling and Brighton's defense come back at 65th minute of the game.
The Argentine managed to place the 2-0 end readily on the penalty stick.
With six victories and one equilibrium, City, who started the season, leads the Valioliiga with 19 points in catch.
But Liverpool, who played one match less, claimed only one point away.
Liverpool faces Chelsea on Saturday night in their own seventh round.
Youth clubs selected new decision-makers in Joensuu
At its meeting closed on Sunday, Finland's Youth Office elected new decision-makers for the next three-year period 2019-2021.
Anu Sivonen Ylä-Savo and Petra Mäkeläinen Häme were elected president.
The delegation was elected by 40 actual members and 40 deputies, Finland's Youth Office informs Sunday.
The youth club meeting was held in Joensuu.
We want our cultural hobby to be known for quality and safety.
The Youth Union meeting in Joensuu gives three promises in its three-year operating goals: we keep the doors open to everyone, and we organise a level playing field depending on the residence and background. without both supporting volunteering and people on their own growth paths, the Finnish Youth Office says in its announcement.
Lewis Hamilton boasted of Kimi Räikkö and surprised Ferrari: "Lose a very important driver"
In an interview with Swiss magazine Blick, Mersu's British musician was asked whether he believed Kimi Räikkösen's release from Ferrara's services would help Hamilton in the rest of the season.
Hamilton leads Ferrari's second couscous Sebastian Vetteli with 40 points in the World Cup.
Just under three weeks ago, Ferrari announced that Räikkönen would not continue in the winter next season, while Räikkönen announced he would move to Sauber.
Hamilton, of course, doesn't believe Räikkönen would solve the hanskoja tiskiin.
I don't think Kimi's changing in the remaining shows.
He's an extraordinary professional - a fantastic driver.
He remains one of my favorites and I am convinced that Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
It doesn't make sense to me.
Hamilton has previously announced that Räikkönen has been one of his examples.
I don't know if Kimi knows this, but when I was young and I dreamed of formula of individuals, I played F1 games with PlayStation all day long.
I was always Kimi, which is a time of madness, Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season continues on Sunday at the Russian stock race.
Mercedes' Valtteri Bottas leaves from the backyard at 2: 00 p.m.

Football's A-Youth SM-series Championship became a full farssi: the opponent arrived at the scene with only 7 players' forces
The top series of football boys ends on Saturday, playing the last round of the season.
Before the 13th round of the Championship, the starting points were clear: FC Lahti for the Academy was enough for an individual space in practice against Vasa IFK.
To turn the situation around in the final round, Ilveksen, who is second in the Championship, must beat PK-35 and hope for the defeat of the talented.
In practice, however, the Lahtelaist championship secured already before the start of the wicket, as Vasa IFK had arrived in Lahti with only seven players' forces.
Should there have been one less Waasalais, the match could not have been started.
FC Lahti Akatemia won the match 16-0.
In the break, the lahtelais conducted 7-0.
One reason for the casualties is that the team has played in part with the same players in the A-Youth SM series, i.e. the P20 series and the men's C-lohko.
In practice, Vasa IFK has played against the whole season falling.
In the final round of Kakkos on Saturday, Vasa IFK is forced to win the JBK in a guest performance while hoping that Tampere United will lose its own guest performance against KuFua at Siilinjärven Toivala.

According to the rescue plant, the road was wet from traces of rain.
The police party visited the accident site.
Supo looks forward to new ways of intelligence: equipment purchases and recruitments already done, foreign planning activities are not hijacked
According to Supo's chief executive, Antti Pelttar, the intelligence law has been reserved by doing equipment purchases and training staff.
When intelligence laws come into effect, the supon budget should be permanently increased by around 10 million euros.
The conservation police (supon) in Helsinki's Ratakadulla are already fully prepared for the entry into force of the intelligence laws.
Antti Pelttari, head of Supo's composition, tells Lännen Medial that device acquisitions have already been made for future intelligence mandates.
Serena Williams harasses with a video where she sings in the topless - campaigns for breast cancer awareness
Serena Williams, the superstar of tennis, is envious again.
Now she's campaigning to raise awareness of breast cancer by publishing a video on her Instagram account, in which she sings her hands alone in front of her breasts, reports the news agency AFP.
The piece is Australian The Divinylsin's 1991 hit I Touch Myself.
In the video, Williams supports the work of the Australian breast cancer association.
"I voted for The Divinys' worldwide hit to remind women to do regularly omnipresent [breast] checks," Williams writes in her Instagram post.
And yes, this placed me in the discomfort zone, but I wanted to do it because the subject touches all women, regardless of skin colour, throughout the world.
Early detection is all a and o - it's a game for many lives.
Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53, is the second writer of The Divinyls.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project, which has been made in honour of Chrissy Amphletti.
"She lost her breast cancer but gave us a hit table to remind women to put her health first," Williams says.
The video has now been viewed 1.5 million times.
It was published early on Sunday morning.
In the video's comments, Williams is praised for courage.
Williams abandoned Beijing's tennis tournament earlier this week.
There's a kohu at the U.S. Open tennis tournament three weeks ago.
Williams came to the top jury of the match and claimed, among other things, that men were accepted for much more restrictive use than women's players.
Chinese restaurant on the mountain trail is not suitable for high chambers
In addition to traditional Chinese delicacies, the restaurant offers stunning landscapes.
An exceptional restaurant has been opened in China's province of Zhejiang.
It's literally located in the kallion language.
From there, you can watch the forest spreading underneath.
The chilly landscapes at heights make restaurant visitors bury their lives in the mountains of Longquan.
Getting to the restaurant requires a hike in the middle of peach trees.
The restaurant opened to hikers 19.9.2018.
YouTube comments wonder where the restaurant's water is located.
Hiking to the restaurant requires a good bottom line, the site is told.
Korpela Kujanjuoksu ends today: that's how everything ends
Everything good ends in due course.
Today, that's what happens to the domestic country drama Korpela's Kujanjuoksu, which has been quite held.
The third production season has gone like hot stones: last week, the episode watched television as a first performance of 722,000 Finns.
There is no longer any practical significance in the top figures in itself, as Heikki Luoma and Jukka Mäkisen's series are no longer coming.
In the final season, the Jaskan-Mirku relationship takes a brain touch forward again, and Jaskan's mother tends to guess what I'm supposed to come first.
Ans and Miisa are warm, in the light of recent events, directly romantic, but then Laiho appears once again in the patterns.
The police are in doubt about the man's relationship.
Nobody, however, part of you, is aware of Laiho's fate in advance.
Anita, for her part, is allowed to hear incredible news.
Kauko's last will comes to light, bringing a woman to tears.
In a week's time, the latest episode of Sorjonen will continue on Sunday nights.
Korpela Kujanjuoksu on TV1 today at 9: 05 p.m.
Is it worth going to work tomorrow in a small flu?
Here's the facts for and against
The flu season is hot.
Many are scared whether or not you're staying home.
However, it is worth considering whether it is worthwhile for others to go infectious, because the disease can be infectious, even though their own symptoms would be small.
In between, flu symptoms suddenly struggle, in between, they appear on the skies.
In the latter option, you may already infect others, although your own symptoms would feel small, reports the Prevention publication.
So is it worth staying home?
According to Prevention, flu is infectious even when a person has no symptoms.
The virus is infected days before the symptoms start and from five days to a week.
Children may infect the disease for longer.
As soon as you identify the symptoms, you shouldn't be in school or at work.
You can come back to work when you cough and you don't have fever anymore, says medical professor Gregory Poland.
Workout is also worth avoiding.
Too quick to return to the hall slows recovery.
Besides, wash your hands, throw them in the nose and throw them in the raspberry.
But as a pain in the movement?
If you have to leave a home sick, consider using a protective mask.
The mask doesn't like viruses, but keeps the user aware of the area of the head.
Then the fingers don't come into the nose or mouth, Poland says.
The brainstorms are also restricted with the mask.
How could infections then be avoided?
The best way is still to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
But it's hard to avoid the latter.
In the United States, for example, the average man touches his eyes, nose or kisses every 15-30 seconds, Poland warns.
New Miss Suomi repeats missionary heritage: "My husband is an ice hockeyman"
Ice hockey player and missiles are often combined.
That's what happened to Alina Voronkova, 23, too.
Alina Voronkova, a native of Pertunmaa, has got to her crown of Miss Finland 2018.
Kaunotar now lives in Lahti, where she changed at the age of 15.
Alina's mother is an ancient Finnish and father is a Russian.
The father's Russianism, Voronkova, was extorted at school.
My mother and father moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was tempted because of my Russianness.
In Pertunmaa, I didn't have any friends at all, Alina tells Miss Suomi at the semi-finalists' ceremony.
After the upper season, Alina decided to start from a pure table and move to Lahti to go to high school.
Soon, the missionary season found new friends, and the ark went to roll with hope.
Then the 15-year-old imagines being an adult, but then, thoughtfully, I wasn't really.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner Joonas Hurrin, who is familiar with Pelicans' ranks.
After SM-Liiga's career, the ice hockey player has played abroad, like in Sweden and China.
In 2009, she was in the Finnish team at the 18-year-old World Cup.
In the early days of the club, the couple, or nearly a year's distance, but later Alina got to travel with her husband to the world.
If I got into the winning triangle and with it I was sporting a career, then I don't want to believe it would affect our relationship in any way.
Although we would have to live separately, then we have confidence well and in the distance it's the good side that it's the starting point to stay above the full-time, Alina mistaken in May.
Happiest of continued growth, death in our kinters

Still, absolutely nothing wants to give up.
Sustainable options are being sought for continued growth, but theory of affordable economics collides with big problems.
The continued growth of the economy has brought living standards to ordinary people in a few generations, particularly in the northern hemisphere, from which only dreams could be seen before.
Nonetheless, the long-standing exuberance of Earth's carrying capacity and climate change make this market economy rock footfall horrifying.

One defence mistake brought us a full scoreboard, Allen harmed.

Lehterä looked overwhelmed, the playground wasn't sure yet
Jori Lehterä's strong power play came to light when his NHL club Philadelphia Flyers played his last workout before the start of the season.
Philadelphia won Boston 4-1, and Lehterä eaten Michael Rafflin twice into the ground.
In recent days, Lehterä has been on display due to drug injuries.

The restaurant ship m / s Tampere was used for cattle in Pyhäjärvi – "Fixed with stone"
The inland waterway m / s Tampere drove the cattle late on Friday night in Akaalla Pyhäjärve.
On Friday night, the rescue service received an alarm about the water traffic accident after half past twelve.
The 30-metre vessel m / s Tampere has driven to the lamb, and is firmly attached to its bow on the stone, described by daytime firefighter Matti Willman.
There were 19 passengers and five crew members.
According to the rescue service, personal injuries were avoided.
Passengers and almost all crew members have been evacuated to the continent away from the ship.
Now they're being moved by bus towards Tamperetta, told day-to-day chief Jari Nieminen to STT after one o'clock at night.
Ambulances were alerted to the port of Viiala to receive evacuated passengers.
The ship, which travelled from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, had for some reason driven away from its route on the western side of the narrow Jumusensalmi.
Police are investigating the cause of events.
Daytime firefighter Matti Willman told earlier in the evening that the conditions on the lake are difficult because of the darkness and quite harsh wind.
According to the rescue service, the fate of the ship is unclear.
The ship apparently doesn't leave.
After the evacuation operation, the divers will take a look at what the situation is on the bottom.
The m / s Tampere, built in 1957, is an inland waterway vessel currently operating as a restaurant vessel, with a maximum allowed passenger volume of 180 people.
The boat also has a meeting room for private use.
According to the ship's website, the cruiser has been dragged down in 2001, 2014 and 2017.

Ex managers demand unpaid rewards from Robert Helenius
Boxer Robert Helenius's evening match against Erkan Teperi is shadowing the rahari.
Ilta-Sanomat today announced a challenge application filed by boxing manager Jaakko Helmisen and vice judge Jussi Kokkila, in which Helenius receives a total of fairly over €80,000 in favour of unpaid managers awards.
According to the challenge application, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helenius 15.4.2014-30.1.2015.
We've tried to agree, but there's no other option.
There has been a clear mandate here, and a lot of work has been done, Kokkila says to Ilta-Sanomi.
Helenius's current manager, Markus Sundman, sent a reply to Iltalehti telling you about the events in the boxer's vision.
Helenius disputes being obliged to pay the sum demanded.
In return, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services in an economically troubled situation to Helenius and promised to be able to organise matches and sponsorship revenues for him.
Sans doute, it had been agreed that Helenius was obliged to pay premiums for only percentages of his matches.
It was repeatedly assured that Helenius needed nothing to pay, only to receive the revenues arranged by them.
This is also a normal and unique practice in managing professional athletes.
No salary work has ever been agreed and such would also have been absurd in Helenius's situation, Sundman finds out in his communication.
There was never a written agreement on cooperation.
In return, Helenius would have liked to agree to a revenue distribution in writing from the outset, but Kokkila and Sundman did not receive the draft until the end of 2014.
She said the proposal on her own behalf, breaking down cooperation with Kokkila and Helmisen.
Helenius didn't sit talking to Kokkilan and Helmisen.
A year after the cooperation ended, Helenius had been shown a "unidentified but measurable" drop in the manager's work.
This year, the position has been raised with the same allegations.
Helenius considers Helmisen and Kokkila's aftermath to be cowardly, the reply says.
Helenius faces today's boxing alliance in Stuttgart, Erkan Teper, the seventh challenger of IBF's heavy series.
Heartfelt man and good journalist
Ilkka "Ile" Vainio, a violin artist and music producer, felt an advanced radio trainer and journalist Erkki Pällin for decades.
Erkki Pälli, a long-line radio trainer and journalist, lost to impaired liver cancer at the age of 83.
The drinker's death announcement was published Sunday in Helsingin Sanomi.
The announcement indicates Päll's death on 3 September.
Pälli told him about the serious illness on his Facebook page in March 2018.
The publication was also seen at the time by Ile Vainio, whose knowledge of the fate was tolerated.
He's already left on Facebook as though he's icy, Ile Vainio says.
Vainio considers Erkki Pälli as a multidimensional partenaire, which became a brilliant journalist.
She remembers Päll's being considered a man who had quick hooks and funny jutut.
I learned to know Erkin already as a little boy when I went to Finnlevy at the age of 12 for the first time and started there as a stolen man.
We were familiar with Erkin then.
He was then a Finnlevy informant and in various roles, Ile Vainio remembers.
When I was going to make records as a music producer, there were hundreds of occasions where Erkki Pälli was the incumbent of artists at every ceremony.
He was always expert and saw how much fire he had for entertainment, music and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, she got straight to her interviewing skin.
He was a heartfelt man and a good journalist.
For many, she became acquainted with Ylen as a radio-runner, but she also wrote brilliant magazines.
Erkki interviewed me many times.
He was good to talk, Vainio praises.
Over the decades, Pälli worked with Toivo Kärjen in addition to provider work.
He worked as a music producer on Vesa-Matti Loir's records.
Päll's greatest passion, however, was a radio work in which she had an omintake style.
She worked on radio from the 1960s, and she became acquainted with numerous audiences at the Yle Eetter.
Pälli retired in 1998.
On Saturday, the Finnish Ski Federation announced that the financial season closed in May showed a profit of around 450,000 euros.
The alliance describes a "full rule" experienced in its economic situation, though the economy is certainly burdened by "significant debt in the balance sheet."
Mika Kulmala, chief executive, praises quick reaction and tight economic discipline.
We reacted as quickly as possible to the situation last autumn.
The careful planning and economic management of the operation has splashed throughout our organisation, Kulmala says in a briefing.
We have also been very successful in partner procurement and, in addition, the return on the World Cup was maximal in the course of the competition season.
However, the cost management should continue to be accurate, and at the same time we should constantly look for new financial models.
I heard my wife crying for help, but then came silence
Dozens of bodies are lying in a hospital backyard in Palu's city on the island of Sulawes.
Only one building distinguishes them from the area where injured survivors have been assembled for assessing the need for injuries and treatment.
Patients should also be treated outdoors due to traceability.
One of those moving in the hospital area was a 52-year-old Baharuddin, who was looking for his son.
Like many Indonesians, he uses just one name.
I have one child, and she's in the streets.
I spoke to him last time he was going to school, Baharuddin told AFP.
Dwi Haris, who has received injuries to his back and arms, lay in the yard of the Army Hospital in Palussa.
She was at a local hotel with her wife and daughter at the beginning of the rebellion.
The family had been invited to Paluu's wedding party.
I was probably forced to squeeze under the collapsed wall.
I heard my wife crying for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him and my child.
I hope they're safe, Haris news agency told AP, according to British media.
Small shops being robbed
At Palu's evacuation centre, 35-year-old baby mother Risa Kusuma tried to calm her baby from fever.
She described the tunnels in the city as symptoms.
Pure water is scarce.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere, Kusuma said.
Many of Palu's residents have slept outdoors or in temporary bamboo houses.
Although the house would be able to somewhere else, potential traces could destroy it definitively and bury residents underneath.
More than half of the prisoners in Palu's prison were expelled after the prison walls collapsed, according to the news agency AP.
Prisoners were knowingly about 560, so there are potentially around 300 carriages.
Part of Donggala's prison prisoners has also fallen, reports The Jakarta Post.
According to the magazine, prisoners raided and blazed into the prison's fire after the guards had denied them leaving to search for their relatives affected by the earthquake and tsunami.
Palu's airport has been reopened mainly for assistance flights.
Among the first, the army's C-130 carriage machine landed on the field, bringing aid supplies.
Commercial flights to Palu's field are only allowed in a limited manner.
Pilots are forced to descend on the field without the assistance of the air traffic control as the air traffic control tower was badly damaged during the earthquake.
Rain wipes overnight across Finland
Throughout the country, an anti-Sunday night spreads a long rain zone from the west direction, reports the Institute of Ilmatia.
Rain mostly comes as water, but in central and northern Lapland it is expected to burst or snow.
The top packs of the previous night are not repeated because under the cloud cover, temperatures remain higher.
The Pilviser Night keeps the lowest temperatures time efficiently in check.
Even in the west, you can visit instantly on the side of the pack, said daytime meteorologist Ville Ilkka.
On Sunday, the rain zone is coming towards the east with a measurement of the morning.
There are cuffs or pupils in the south and west.
In the afternoon, temperatures always move to Oulu's altitude by stages of 10-13 degrees.
The beginning week appears similar to the temperatures in the south and middle of the country, but the weather is becoming more volatile.
Wind and wave warnings are in place in marine areas.
Actual autumn storms are not expected for the next few days, but otherwise the figure has a typical autumn variable weather.
Yes, it's the autumn that's now starting to brown on top, Ilkka said.
Miss Suomi - finale not visible on TV
From IL-TV, you can watch the red carpet glamoury and electricity of the Miss Suomi contest.
Iltalehden entertainment journalists attract direct broadcasts on IL-TV from the red carpet of the Miss Suomi final from the Billnäs screens.
The broadcast begins at around 18.50am.
The new Miss Suomi will be crowned on Saturday by 10 finalists.
The Miss Suomi 2018 finale is held in Billnäs' screens in Raasepor.
Before the finale starts, you'll be able to follow the atmosphere from the spot on the live broadcast of IL-TV.
The live broadcast starts at around 6.30 p.m. and continues for about an hour.
A particularly large number of Miss Suomi winners of previous years have been invited to the finale this year.
In the jury, they are represented by Miss Suomi Jonna Ziprus of 1998.
Other representatives of the jury include welfare entrepreneur Jutta Gustafsberg, photographer Nadi Hammouda, CEO of Jounin Kaupan Minttu Murphy-Kaulanen and Seiskan news producer Katja Lintunen.
We hoped he would get to university before going to missionary sources
The Russian Dimitri and Svetlana mother believed in her daughter's success in the Miss Suomi final.
Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkova, parents of fresh Miss Suomen Alina Voronkova, followed their daughter's first-time crown with pride.
Ignoring the audience from Pertunmaa, they were going to drive back home after the finale.
It's a wonderful atmosphere!
We believed in Erika all the time, but half an hour before the result began to be tense, Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana is an Indian and Dimitri is a Russian.
Alina spoke to a smooth Russian, although she has lived her entire childhood in Finland.
Svetlana says Alina was less interested in showing and many other things than the missionary career.
Alin was often said that when she is so she seemed like she should start as a missionary.
But she announced she wanted to be a radio pilot.
It was later that Alina inspired the beauty contests.
The parents' hope was that Alina would get to the university before attending the Miss Suomi race.
That's what happened, and eventually Alina still wanted to do a Scandinavian degree before the missikisoja.
We already questioned last year why she wasn't involved, but she wanted to make it Scandinavian.
Parents believe Alina won the race because she is a healthy example for young people and adults.
She sports a lot and eats healthy.
And Alina likes to be up, it's visible.
Alina's boyfriend, Joonas Hurri, is hockeying for work in Japan, and didn't get to Finland to encourage his loved ones in the final.
Alina's parents believe the relationship between young people takes a missionary year.
Yes, that's what it's supposed to be!
Parents hoped the daughter would soon be able to walk.
Now there has been such a long break in visits because of missiles.
It's already boring, although messages have been produced.
Young man died in Lahti - police captured three people
Three people have been arrested as a result of the incident, according to the police.
On Saturday, Hämeen's police did not comment on the course of events, nor on the possible deliberalism of the investigation, appealing for incompleteness.
Police also didn't comment on whether the attacked persons and the man who died in the limbo knew each other.
More information on the case will be available early next week.
Sari Piippo abandoned her career in Brussels and became a home maid in Finland - a pipekahti idea of cartoon: lack of drawing skills didn't slow down
The organic couple once left my husband's song, in which he suggested it as a person for me to develop a story, tells Espoola's cartoon blogger, housewife and former EU translator Sari Piippo.
Sari Piippo tells himself to be an EU translator for economic and legal affairs in Brussels until after a fourth child, the family became a ten-year-old returnee.
I'm entertained as a home-made thing well.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point it came to mind that what a father would do when even the smallest child already began to be big.
Then, in 2014, the photo became a cartoon.
Piippo says he had never dreamed of making a cartoon, although he had read Aku Ankka, Tintti and Asterix as a small one.
I was drawn last as a child, but when these manuscripts began to emerge, then the situation changed.
I made some dozens of manuscripts in the first place.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (s. 2000) is a skilled drawer, but I didn't get her attracted until the summer of 2016, when I donated Viiviä with the help of a drawing board.
His enthusiasm lasted a dozen strips, and then it was forced to start trying itself, laughing at Piippo, who tells the drawing board to have been a great encouragement for him.
Piirtolevy is an easy and convenient tool to try to get something done.
For the paper, I wasn't even trying to draw, tells Piippo about his relationship to draw, which he usually practices in the evening.
Manuscripts keep popping in mind, but usually I'm not doing ready at once.
To one of the three strippers, you'll go up to several hours.
I might do the screw at once and I'd love to play with the colors.
It's always the hardest thing to start drawing because drawing isn't my strongest.
Sari Piippo tells her appreciation for the newspaper's contemporary comics, including Scott Adams Dilberti.
As individuals in the organic cabbage, the L-theme is hurated by a porkkanavartalo mother, who has a salad pie.
Other people are Male, Pissis and Twins.
In the world of creativity, man is what he eats.
The ideas of the series come from your own life and social media.
Sari Piippo doesn't want to preach or offer a forced bottle, although it's in between.
Piippo tells him to read his series to his husband and children.
It's such a wonderful feeling when you look at the cartoon you're drawing and say that's what I've done today.
And challenges are enough for home mothers!

Indonesian earthquake: the director of the aircraft sacrificed himself - didn't leave a cracking tower until hundreds of passengers were secured
Anthonius Gunawan Agung, a 21-year-old flight director, has risen as the hero of Indonesia's earthquake.
Agung was left alone in the air traffic control tower until the hundreds of passengers carrying hundreds of people were safer to travel from the island shaken by the earthquake.
The youngster was in charge of the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport in the city of Palu when the earthquake struck on Friday.
When others escaped from the air traffic control tower, Agung refused to leave his seat before getting guided from the Batik Air passenger aircraft runway.
That's how he could save hundreds of lives, the Indonesian Aviation Administration told AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrien airport on Saturday after the earthquake.
Lennon's steering tower roared and cracked.
Eventually, Agung tried to save himself by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
His foot broke and he got serious internal injuries.
Agung was attacked at a nearby hospital.
He was supposed to be transported to a better-equipped facility by helicopter, but he passed 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, an aviation administration representative told The Jakarta Postille.
The distress continued to intensify as the flight entered the atmosphere, measuring 7.5 magnitudes for its strength.
At least 832 people lost their lives.
The Indonesian Aviation Administration has respected Agung's heroism on social media.
Rehn réfléchissait à la fin de l' Europe à son trafic: "Need to watch the next twiitti"
Trade between the United States and China is reflected in the global economy as a whole.
Growth forecasts have been calculated across Europe and the Bank of Finland has also slightly reduced its own economic growth estimates.
Chief executive Olli Rehn said in Ylen's department store that, though the tightening tension doesn't directly affect European trade flows, it undermines confidence, which in turn reflects companies' investment decisions.
The situation also concerns exports of Finnish companies.
For the time being, Mr Rehn considers Europe to be very playful.
It has been able to build a peace of mind with the United States and contributed to calming the situation with China and Japan as well.
Europe doesn't seem to Rehn's frustration in the legs of the trade war.
Keep looking at the next twiitti and then estimate.
We have a timeless partner in Washington's direction, however, he said in Ylen's interview.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of them is Italy's third-largest national economy in the euro zone, which is also one of the most indebted states in the euro zone and the whole of the western world.
Yesterday, the market reacted harshly by the Italian government on Thursday night to present a clear deficit budget.
Next year's deficit is more than 2.4% of the population's production.
Rehn considers Italy's situation worrying.
Five per cent of the country's lending stock constitutes problem credits and non-organised credits represent more than 10 per cent.
In addition, its public finances are in weak positions and the country seems to be once again exceeding its commitment to its European partners.
Maybe it's not worth painting yet new crises, Rehn answered when asked about Italy's new economic crisis in Europe.
Another thing that tries Europe is Britain's difference from the EU.
Rehn hoped it would fit.
The disputed difference would become much more negative.
Rehn started as chief executive of the Bank of Finland in July.
Mario Draghi, chief executive of the European Central Bank (ECB), will withdraw from his mission in a fair year.
The conversation with his successor has begun.
Both Rehn and his predecessor Erkki Liikasen's name has spilled in speeches.
Surely it wouldn't hurt if there were Finnish names involved, Rehn said, adding that he wasn't going to comment on the matter beyond that.
HS's super-recommended Black Box performances will continue again next week - final tickets to Helsinki are on sale
The popular Black Box performances organised by Helsingin Sanomien continue once again in the beginning of the week.
Other performances will be seen at the National Theatre on 2, 8 and 11 October.
On 23 October, the Black Box visits Tampere Theatre for the first time.
There are still some tickets on sale at the National Theatre.
Tampere's proposition is finished.
Tickets myy Lippu.fi.
During the evening, journalists and photographers appearing on the scene tell you they have long been preparing a tositar, which has not been published previously in any HS instrument.
There's something involved again, something nobody's guaranteed to ever hear.
"It's a strange spy at night in Helsinki, an impressive reportage from one side of the globe and a talking story about a very topical health issue," explains Esa Lilja, one of the producers of the Black Box.
After the performance, the audience will have the opportunity to meet HS journalists and photographers and continue the discussion.
Helsingin Sanomat has held live journalism evenings for three years.
They've been popular and often finished sellers since the beginning.
More than 15,000 people have already visited.
The black box was rewarded in Bonnier-gaalas as an act of journalism.
The rewards praised a new way of making journalism, as well as the journalists' desire to become close to their readers.
A black box for spring 2019 will be seen at the National Theatre in March-April.
The performance is also visiting Tampere and Turku.
The proposition at the time contains a different content than in the evenings of this autumn.
Lost mushroom found thanks to "unprejudiced experiment"
Finland's police drone competence is the world's top: "We're being asked for training"
In addition to searching for missing drones, police can use drones in criminal investigation and intelligence tasks, according to a reporter at the Poliisiammattikorkeakoulu.
Oulu's police managed on Tuesday to find a missing mushroom drone in Raahes in just a couple of minutes.
Kimmo Himberg, the reporter of the Polytechnic School, filed the case and mentioned, among other things, that "through unprecedented experimentation and effective training, we are at the forefront of the world here too."
The drone is quite a new capsule and even the newer in police duties.
There are no statistics that the police in Finland would be a champion of drone use.
According to Himberg, there is a strong perception that this is however the case.
This has survived, for example, when the experiences of the Finnish police have been reported in international events.
Terribly interested in it is elsewhere, Himberg says.
It would be hard for visitors to look at the Finnish police's drone operation.
We're asked about training.
More generalized
Himberg recalls the importance of finding out what's missing in Finland's winter conditions as soon as possible.
As has been said, in Raahen's case, the eccentric was found with drone in just a few minutes.
Already hundreds of drone pilots have been trained by the Finnish police.
According to Himberg, they're supposed to be trained more.
Already, a lot of drones are being used in police duties, and their use will increase and increase in the future.
That's what I would say, Himberg tells.
In addition to searching for missing persons, Himberg says police may use drones, for example, for accident or criminal investigation and for certain intelligence tasks.
For example, it's already supposed to go a little further in revisiting some area, where it's possibly fearful that violence is being faced there.
Dronea can then be used for preliminary inquiry.
Karelia's Rugby rose to the unicorn
Karelia's Rugby celebrated Saturday's 2-divisional victory in Kuopio.
The Joensuulais were still in the middle of the match with a 7-12 loss to the Helsinki Rugby Club, but found a second episode of train and covered southern guests 26-12.
At the same time, the 2-division championship knew the historic rise of Karelia's Rugby to the 1-division.
Previously, the club has played in the individual, but at the time, the Finnish rugby's serial action was divided into two levels, the SM series and multi-pilot 1-division.
The club are going to take the series, but it knows quite a lot of work next winter.
The current roster of nearly twenty players must be increased to 25.
The 1-division also knows the increase in the number of games and longer game journeys, so also the spending must be consistent with it.
Kotkaniemi begins season in Montreal, confirms head coach
Montreal Canadiens head coach Claude Julien, who plays in the ice hockey NHL, confirmed the club's Twitter account that Finnish attacker Jesperi Kotkaniemi will start the season in Montreal.
Montréal booked a super licence for Kotkaniemen, 18, in the first round with a number three summer booking.
The attacker joined Montreal's exercise boom from the end of the summer and has presented strong footsteps during the September exercises.
Kotkaniemi succeeded immediately in his first workout.
Head coach Julien praised the Finnishman for taking big developmental steps after arriving at the alien camp.
The NHL's regular series will start next week against Thursday night in Finland.
Montréal faces Toronto Maple Leafsin in the opening round.
What's a good leader like?
There has been a lot of talk about leadership in Finland this week.
Risto Siilasmaa, the chairman of Nokia's government, told HS's interview about his book, Paranoidi optimistic, in which he shed light on his philosophy of leadership.
At the same time, he criticises the leadership of his predecessor, Jorma Ollila.
Ollila sharply disputed the accusations, but previous Nokia surveys have talked about the inability of managers to act as a team; fear and speechlessness, partly causing the collapse of the mobile phone business.
The company's rising phase of risk-taking and kettery disappeared.
The week in Helsinki also hosted a business leave event Nordic Business Forum, which vetoed Messukeskukse Finland's business life club.
In addition to Barack Obama, 12 bisnes world stars rose to the laval.
The talk of good leadership was enough.
Gary Hamel, legend of leadership, said that a good manager should dare to export the company to the future even when the company goes well.
The problem is that decisions are taken by those who are mentally most tied to past decisions.
John Mackey, founder of the wide range of organic Whole Foods trading package, said the manager should share a message to the entire staff for the company's purpose.
And the purpose of that cannot be simply to make a profit for the owners.
Susan Cain, who wrote about Menestyskirja's introvers, said that the most successful leaders are investigatively humiliating.
They work calmly, quietly and determinedly.
Often they're introvert.
Aswath Damodaran, a finance professor, recalled that the qualities of a good manager should coincide with one phase of the company's life cycle.
In the early stages of the company, the director must be able to tell the story on which the future of the company is based.
A mature company needs a manager who knows the numbers.
Those doctrines at the Nordic Business Forum were listened to by 7,500 visitors - essentially Finnish leaders.
They were at risk of being informed.
There's a lot to be demanded from a good leader.
That's why leadership so often goes to piele, even at the highest level.
Siilasmaa and Ollila were also present.
They thrashed each other in the scenes.
But hardly they wondered if they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And their humiliation wasn't easy to estimate from outside.
Sara Chafak arrived in stunning red carpet straight from Los Angeles - spends most of her year abroad
Model Sara Chafak arrived at the missifinale in a stunning black makeup.
Miss Suomen's 2012 appearance in the makeup also featured a lace laahus.
Little poden jet lagia.
I came again from Los Angeles.
I'm largely spending most of my time there, Chafak says.
Chafak tells me he's visiting Los in casting photos.
He's done advertising photographs, among other things.
Working in the United States, she describes herself as interesting, and also similar to Finland.
Yet work must be done harder, according to him, because the model's work can easily always be found by a substitute.
Chafak says you need to be tougher and aggressive.
Choreographer Sonya Lindfors' 30 000 €live art award in Kuopio
Artist Sonya Lindfors won a €30,000 cultural award on Saturday in Kuopio.
Anti Festival International Prize for Live Art award-winning Lindfors is working on choreography, community activism and teaching.
Sonya Lindfors' art is vital to her neighborhood.
His work gives others the opportunity to work and create spaces for dialogue in environments in which they have previously been missing, the raati described the winner.
In addition to Finnish Lindfors, the award-winning candidates included a number of international artists.
The prize is distributed annually to a live art artist, an exceptionally strong artist or a group.
Danish police found Volvon in the major operation: "We can't tell you where"
Danish police's extensive searches have produced a result.
At the start of the operation, traffic had been closed at the bridges of Juutinraum and Ison-Belt.
All land and ferry traffic from the island of Själlan was closed to Sweden, Germany and elsewhere in Denmark.
Police are looking for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
Is aimed at the Copenhagen Police Media Centre's Vulture Manager.
A searched car has been found.
We can't tell yet where the car was found, Henrik Storm informs Copenhagen police Ilta-Sanomi.
According to Storm, the black Volvolla does not have direct contact with the threat, according to the police.
According to him, the biggest danger is over.
Danish Ekstra Bladet told the police about Saturday's briefing.
Jørgen Bergen Skov, the chief executive of the investigation, was in charge of the operation.
He didn't want to tell you which criminal name you're investigating.
But Skov said it was a "serious crime."
It was a threat to people's lives.
Three people have been searched in the operation.
Police won't tell if they've already been captured.
According to the magazine, ferry restrictions have been cancelled.
Copenhague police also followed events on their Twitter account.
STT says, however, according to the police, the general public no longer has any cause for concern, as the threat was directed at certain people.
Macedonia's name has caused decades of divorce - now the people vote on the matter in contentious elections
Macedonia, situated in the Balkans, is currently voting on the proposal to become the country's new name.
According to the Macedonian and Greek governments "agreement", the Republic of North Macedonia would become the name.
Until now, Greece has blocked Macedonia's efforts to become a member of NATO and the EU.
According to Greece, Macedonia's name belongs to its northern province.
The question of the referendum does not mention a new name, but asks whether the voter supports Macedonia's membership of the EU and NATO by approving the agreement.
The vote began online at least at the school in the centre of the capital Skopje.
Olivera Argirosvka, a retired nurse voting at the school, hoped the agreement would be supported.
The referendum marks a change if it opens the doors to Europe and NATO.
It means change, especially for young people, she said.
In 1991, Macedonia's independence has been used in official contexts as the Republic of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaevin's government has campaigned for the agreement to be approved.
The nationalist right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has called for a boycott of the referendum.
In addition to the result, it's sufficiently exciting whether the voting turnout will rise above the 50% required.
The referendum is not binding, but the victory of a yes vote would allow the mandate to change the constitution.
A two-thirds majority of Parliament is needed to amend the Constitution.
The Greek Parliament, too, still needs to approve the deal.
Voting places are closed in the evening eighth in Finland's time.
Comea victory!
Robert Helenius stormed Erkan Teperin
Robert Helenius faced late Saturday night at Erkan Teper's heavy series professional boxing exhibition in Germany.
The 34-year-old Finnish took measurements of his 36-year-old German opponent in the Waldenbuch in Stuttgart.
The evening's principal was the IBF League's heavy-handed Intercontinental title match.
Its winner can open up an opportunity to take part in Saturday's tough roles, with considerable economic significance.
Helenius settled the match in the eighth installment, when he smashed Teper's hard left hand with his blow.
Teper was no longer able to rise from the floor.
"Nordic Nightmare" ransacked its opponent already in the third batch, leaking blood from the German nose.
Helenius and Teper faced for the first time.
They were supposed to be already in December 2015.
Then Teper appealed to the injury and withdrew from the match.
It was then revealed that the German had suffered twice in the doping test.
Helenius has exported his name from his professional matches to 28 matches and suffered two losses.
Teper, who went into the match as a clear favorite, has won 19 professional matches in his career and disappeared three times.
Hamilton's orders for victory - difference Vetteli already scored 50 points
The Formula One championship approached his confirmation again as Mercedeksen Lewis Hamilton won the GP of Russia and stretched his World Championship lead to Ferrari's Sebastian Vetteli already at 50 points (306-256).
There are five more remaining kisoja.
Valtteri Bottas, who departed from the widow's backyard, drove second.
Last year in Sochi, Bottas, who took his career opening victory, held a tip for those who sent the cat halfway through, but Mercedes commanded Botta to get past Hamilton.
Vettel ran third, Ferrari Kimi Räikkönen fourth.
Red Bullin's Max Verstappen, who started from the last round of departures, was fifth.
Double sorrowed in Joensuu by a Jewish man - stuck on the card
Two men apologized for the 31-year-old Jewish man Joensuu Siltakatu at 12 on Saturday after 18: 00.
According to police, the men also analysed the victim's phone, among other things.
Police targeted the suspect, i.e. a 35-year-old man in July and a 39-year-old man in ilomantsila, to reach the card shortly after the incident.
They were arrested on suspicion of robbery, police say.
The victim received injuries, which did not require a visit to the doctor.
Elon Musk, CEO of electric car company Tesla, leaves his role as chairman of the company's Board of Directors.
Musk has agreed on the matter with the us authorities.
At the same time, Musk has been fined $20 million for his allegations that he would have secured funding to pull Tesla away from the stock exchanges.
U.S. Securities Commission sec has accused Muskia of securities fraud.
Musk will continue as Tesla's CEO, but the company will also have to pay €20 million in fines if the agreement between the authorities and Musk is confirmed by law.
Canada fight against time to achieve a deal from Nafta with the USA
Time is threatening to end in the US-Canada negotiations on the Free Trade Agreement on Nafta.
The U.S. has set a season for Sunday, and the negotiators in the countries have discussed intensely through the weekend.
Canada's chief negotiator, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, postponed his speech at the UN General Assembly in order to focus on trade negotiations in full.
President Donald Trump's demand for the United States, Canada and Mexico opened negotiations about a year ago to renew North America's Free Trade Agreement.
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached an agreement, but no agreement has yet been reached with Canada.
The United States and Mexico want to bring the deal into force before Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who won the presidential election in Mexico, steps into office at the beginning of December.
Trump has said that Canada's involvement in the agreement is not necessary.
He has previously informed Congress that there are plans to sign an agreement at the end of November - whether Canada is involved or not.
Because of these timetables, the agreement text between the United States and Canada should be ready on Sunday to leave sufficient time for the us Congress to assess it.
Neighbour thought candle breaking into fire in Kaakkur - fire alarmed

Police captured eleven people on Saturday after the Honka-HJK match of the men's football league played in Espoo, Teemu Värtinen, the criminal commissioner of the West Uusimaa Police Department, confirmed to STT.
The reason for the attack was to protect against crime and disruption.
The captured were released after the situation had calmed down, Värtinen said.
Earlier, evening words reported on Kiinnioto.
The match ended 0-0.

The situation resulted in thunderstorms and boxers between team supporters.
Among other things, riding poles were needed to stop the situation.
In addition to the field, the bruising occurred in the nearby metro station area, where some of the attachments also occurred.
I wasn't here, but what I saw from the photos, so the situation was uncomfortable, Värtinen referred to the ravage on the field.
According to Värtisen, no criminal report has been made as a result of events.
Pöytäkivi haunted his perhosuin SE time in the world cup, Laukkanen also swims to the finals
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Pöytäkivi have advanced to the finals on the closing day of the swimming World Cup 3 / 7 contests in Holland.
The cats are swimming in Eindhoven on a short track.
The ESC's table stone shattered Finland's record in a 50-yard butterfly, where she was second in the early hours of 22.82.
Earlier in September, Pöytäkivi swimming in Helsinki on tour SE-ajan 22.77.

Laukkanen was 15 years old at 2,14.25 in the start of two hundred metres of confusion.
Students show a rare sensation: ancient tragedy - feared Oresteia affects its visuality
Ancient tragedies are a rare sensation in Finnish scenes.
Par exemple, the National Theatre has recently seen ancient tragedy, Sofokleen Filoktetes, in 1988.
Now theatre college brought the antique's only entirely preserved sampling logic, Aiskhyloksen Oresteian, to a tour starting from Kansallisteatter.
In 2015, Lavat opened! projects, academic students at the Academy of theatre college work together with a professional director internationally.
Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin, is the director of this fourth project, as is the first.
Oresteia, her international first night, was awarded in Berlin in April.
Roiha's arrangement for Oresteia summed up the report on the end of the bloodstream of Atreus, who was sentenced to destruction, and the birth of the rule of law was earnestly honored to twenty minutes, particularly by summarising the choir shares.
The book succeeds in being very loyal to the spirit of Kirsti Simonsuuren hienon suomennok (2003).
The dramatic lights and the theatre's sides revealing presentation highlight a spectacular and bright spectacle.
At its centre is the dynamics between those who disappear from the corner, those who appear in the title roles, and those who come from the corner.
The presentation uses the title roles of the double as well as triple degree.
The actors don't exit at all, so, for example, Agamemnon, who returns from the war in Troy, and Kassandran's murders in this war hall, are shown on display, unlike ancient esitystraditios. it was customary.
Such a proposition does not insist on being loyal to ancient esitystradities.
Rather, before the viewer's eyes, a modern, loyal interpretation of the text is created, which is constantly aware of its ritual roots.
Roiha has succeeded in bringing the masterpiece actor students to the fore as a tight group, directly as a single organism, into a rhythmic set.
Particularly in choir shares, very expressive, sculpted group forms, actors easily bent on their rights in bare, only by decorating a white aisle, with a spectacle.
Impressive.
Oresteia's performance tour continues to the Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.
Korean manufacturer makes first hydrogen vacuum cleaner
The novelty begins to appear in Europe, notably thanks to the cooperation agreement concluded with Hyindain and Swiss H2 Energy.
Hyundai, according to a collaborative agreement published at the Hannover IAA Benefits Vehicle Show, will deliver a thousand car batches of novelty to the sveitsiläisy company and its partners.
By bringing a fuel-combustible truck onto the market, Hyundai continues to produce Nexon and ix35 / Tucson Fuel Cell models by referring to the road as a manufacturer of hydrogen cars.
With this quality in the world's first project, we are taking fuel cell technology further and further.
We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market area of these vehicles, for example by monitoring the development of the tanking network, Hyundai Motor's deputy director In Cheol Lee said during the contract's publication ceremony.
Fists raged on several occasions in Kajaan
A little more than thirty-three-year-old man apologized to three men in a restaurant in the centre of Kajaan and in front of it on Saturday morning.
The man first found one man inside the restaurant, and as a result he was removed from the scene.
Outside, he would push another man to the ground, and in the absence of a third man, the insulter still struck him as well.
Police captured the injurer.
At the police station, the man continued to behave aggressively and would kick another police on foot.
The man also threatened the police with regret and killing.
The man was taken to the tube to calm down.
The case is being investigated in three ways, as well as in violent opposition by an official.
In Kajaan's centre, Välikadulla also experienced a second incident of nausea on Saturday morning.
The victim was affected by two men.
At first, a 20-year-old kajaanite man struck the victim.
A little later, another man swept him to the ground and a previously beaten man still potted the victim.
The outsiders appealed the victims further from the victims and police were called to the scene.
But the authors were already able to leave before the police arrived.
Police are asking the event's eyewitnesses to contact Kajaan's police by phone 0295 416 520, or by e-mail: tutkinta.kainuu @ poliisi.fi.
Long-line radio trainer Erkki Pälli has died
Erkki Pälli, who is known as a longtime supplier, often lost to cancer at the age of 83.
Radio trainer Erkki Pälli, 83, is dead.
She lost an incurable liver cancer, she told her Facebook page in March 2018.
Yes, that's spending now.
The doctor has said it, I live a day at a time, he commented on the situation to Iltalehti a month ago.
The safety of trade aunts and sets must be guaranteed
For the first time, I received a leaf confession in 1984.
When these vintages make some stuff amazing, it's usually about big news.
When I wrote (Karelian, 27.9.) about the insecurity of retail workers, I was amazed and moments even a little angry.
Erika Kähärää, an employment expert at the service industry union (Pam), also spoke in this context.
Criminal statistics don't tell the real situation, he says.
The problem is growing, although employers of course claim others.
There are only clearly serious incidents that go to the police's knowledge, and many of the correct situations of violence remain unreported.
"Of course, businesses have an obligation to statisticize their situation closely on the basis of the employment safety law, but these statistics remain usable internally and their data are not collected at all," he said.
Mental injuries don't end up in the statistics.
There has always been a problem in violent situations that they don't always cause physical injuries.
Despite this, mental traumas can be much more serious than bruises and wounds.
The difference between the situation of violence and the threatening situation of violence is difficult to draw when a certain level of aggressive threat too must be calculated as violence - although there would be no handshake.
Too many people are afraid of their jobs, although the actual act doesn't happen.
Some residential areas are troubled.
The shop has acquired guards.
When shop opening hours were released, there was a visible drowning time on the media about its consequences for the salesmen's safety.
"At the time, many employers organised guardianship services in at least night-time hours and solely to prevent work," Kähärä commented.
When nothing happens, the wrong conclusion is drawn.
This would now seem to have had an effective effect, but this will produce a new negative trend.
When, because of the guarding, the disruptions remained well in possession, a mood emerged that it would be unnecessary to be guarded.
Now, in many places, attempts are being made to find solutions that could eliminate expensive guard services.
Mild regret is a lawyer's court, and it's quite understandable that a seller who has been bullied doesn't want to make an inquiry into a criminal who normally lives in the shop.
But similarly, according to the subparagraph of the law of 2011, mild evil will become under the prosecutor if it happens at the workplace.
I think we need precedent right now.
When the next time the shop aunt or unleashed, the police should investigate and accuse the prosecutor.
When the court injected a few evildoers into prison, and a sentencing from there for the hard escape of the penalty scale, then the habits would smear.
A society where the food store is supposed to be open like a night in a toddler's settlement is supposed to guarantee the safety of trade workers.
Heidi Sohlberg denied the missiles before the start of the direct broadcast - "Sara, Iiro is then married"
Missi's crown is not seen in a traditional way on TV this year, but the broadcast is shown on Viafree's website.
The ex-Miss Suomi Heidi Sohlberg and Viasatin and the host of Viaplay's NHL and KHL studios, Iiro Harjula.
Janni Hussi is the runner-up for Backstage and Red Maton.
Before directly broadcasting, the trio informed visitors arriving at the scene and media representatives of the time of the broadcast.
Initially, Sohlberg asked the public to give Harjula a raging aplod.
Now all women kiljukaa!
Look now at this male drinker of ours, Sohlberg glowed at his colleague's audience.
Miss Suomi of many previous years follows the front-running kisses.
Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi, among others, sat next door and Sohlberg threw a small joke in the direction of someone.
Sara, Iiro is married then!
Sohlberg blossomed looking at Saroi.
The more probably Sohlberg referred to the very resigned Sieppi, who laughed at the commentator, though initially appeared confused.
Sieppi spoke about his resignation for the first time in the Ilta-Sanomien weekend magazine.
The Missikaunotar said he didn't want to open the reasons for the difference more accurately in public, because it's a matter between him and Roope Salmisen.
She said she doesn't have a rush to a new relationship, she's going to focus on herself.
I'm focusing on my own stuff and especially the industry is living my own life on its own, Sara Sieppi told me.
Harjula's marriage status came to light even later when Sohlberg accidentally mistakenly called Janni Hussia and Iiro Harjula a couple.
Juontajakolmikko laughed at the moka.
Iirohan was married or how it went?
Mr Hussi lost his salary.
The Pohjalaismies tortured tied to their open spouse by cooling, burning and feeding a vigorous sauce
Pohjanmaa District Court has sentenced a 34-year-old man living in Kokkola for numerous offences committed against his avoidance spouse to three years in prison.
The crime instrument included belt, cable and nippusite.
The law denounced those objects as lost to the state.
Rank's prosecution concerned the suspect of a major rape.
However, this prosecution was rejected by the court.
Kokkola's cause included four evils, grave evils, compulsion, illegal threats, freedom abuse, grave freedom abuse and two injuries.
The crimes took place between March 26 and May 24.
At the end of the final acts, the man was arrested and imprisoned a couple of days later.
On Thursday last week, the court of justice in Ostrobothnia delivered its sentence and ordered the 34-year-old to remain in Vaasa prison.
No evidence of rape
The 34-year-old was also accused of two major crimes of freedom and a brutal rape on 22 May.
However, these charges were dismissed by the law.
The case was dealt with behind closed doors.
However, the court of justice issued a public description of the sentence.
According to Käräjätuomarin, the accused had targeted his spouse with violence, threats and forcibly in situations where this had been tied.
Accused of victimizing the victim with a knife, burning the tobacco, eating a heavy sauce and pouring water and coffee on it.
In his sentence, the court ordered the state to lose criminal tools: belt and cable, nipples, bathrobe belt, knife and water.
Four witnesses
According to the District Court, the parties continued to live together between the acts.
It can be read from the verdict that a large proportion of the main acts occurred at the end of the criminal cycle.
Four witnesses, two women and two men were consulted.
The 34-year-old must pay compensation for pain, säry, suffering and temporary sharks totalling €5800.
That money is hardly available to him, because the convicted person already has creditors from his old age.
The prison sentence is not the first of a man.
Iltalehti does not tell the convicted name to protect the victim's privacy.
The fresh conviction is not lawful when it comes to writing this.
Europe under four-point leadership for Ryder Cup
On Saturday, European golf professionals jailed their leadership in a traditional hockey game show against the United States.
Europe leads the Ryder Cupia, playing in Paris, to 10-6 points, while still facing Sunday's twelve double-games.
Europe won three of the four square-ball matches started on Saturday, and in the afternoon's four-game gains were levelled at 2-2.
European leaders were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four pairs of matches they played on Friday and Saturday.
None of the European couples had survived the equivalent before.
On Sunday, the double is aiming for more history.
No European player has won five points together in the Ryder Cup, and none of the Americans have gotten to many as three players: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK condemns its supporters "raju disruption" in Honka: "Violence doesn't belong to football"
Football's operating league team HJK published a briefing on Sunday condemning its supporters' disruption in Saturday's FC Honka announcement in Tapiola.
"We regret the aftermath of the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our supporters," the announcement says.
After the match ended, some 50 HJK supporters rushed to the field and some seemed to be trying to challenge the dispute with Hongan supporters.
There was also a killing among supporters.
The arrangers didn't get the situation to calm down, but police and also riding police were needed to the scene.
HJK says in its announcement that the team's players and agents are shocked by the incident.
The post-match events are not consistent with the values of our 111-year-old club.
"We strongly dispense with anything like this, which compromises the safety of match events," the announcement says.
HJK promises to assist authorities and organisers of the event in identifying security threatening factors and removing the phenomena.
The advocacy culture is part of a matter of importance to football and HJK.
We all support positive, joyous and encouraging action in football perspectives.
"Violence doesn't belong to it," the announcement says.
Philippines inventor flying in a drone car - thus avoiding traffic threats
Mendiola is a Filipino inventor, hip-hop dancer and some kind of Pelle Peloton.
He's now part of a growing group of people in the world who swear a car flying their inventions - or at least in their own version of it.
As competitors, he has factors such as Audi and Airbus.
But Mendiola doesn't believe in mass production.
The man has spent much of his possession on building his dreams, according to reports from around the world.
Six years ago, she began developing her flying car.
Now she's calling the development version a drone car.
Recently, she says she's done the first successful test flight - she dipped on her device at a height of more than seven metres.
One of his objectives was to avoid traffic threats.
I hope the device will provoke positive reactions.
That was just a dream five years ago, Mendiola said, according to the British Daily Mail.
JHL anticipates: tomorrow's combat efforts will appear in children's day care and social and health services
In public and well-being sectors, tomorrow's bans on overtime and exchanges are particularly visible in social and health services, as well as in children's day care, said Päivi Niemi-Laine, chairman of JHL.
The effects will be wide, and they will certainly appear in a way that doesn't have enough staff on the ground.
Everyone has to think about how to apply for their children.
The employer's job now is to keep an eye on the fact that the services are playing and that nobody's life is threatened, Niemi-Laine says to STT.
According to Niemi-Lainee, labour shortages also appeared at the beginning of the year, when JHL members were banned on overtime and leases due to contract negotiations.
Employers have made it possible through flexibles that staff have not been hired, but that employees have survived or swapped.
It's not yet any work-fight action.
It's a workplace-protective standard thing that every employee is considered to be concerned about regular working hours and only doing them.
JHL is opposed to the government's intention to lighten the redundancy protection of small businesses.
Markku Jalonen, director of the labour market for municipal employers, will not prejudge the effects of overtime and exchange bans.
But he doesn't think they're very revolutionary, even though services may diminish.
Employers around Finland are aware of this and have made them preparations for what is to be done.
The area is so impossible, social and health activities and the technical sector that it is difficult to say.
The effects can vary considerably by industry, region and type of employer, Jalonen told STT.
Jalonen says that the past week has already had experiences, including the Middle and Basic Care Association of Super and the Association of Social and Health professionals in Tehy's similar, three-day operations.
Their effects were pretty low.
JHL's ban on overtime and exchanges applies, among other things, to workers in municipalities, churches, state and private social and health sectors.
For example, family day-care workers are excluded.
At this stage, the work battle concerns nearly 100,000 JHL members.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL's actions may take a long time.
The union is also prepared for other combat operations if the preparation of the redundancy bill continues.
The government should now admit that this is where you're running into the wall and tough.
Jalosen thinks both the ay movement and the government must come against.
It's extraordinary here that hard is already in the yard, though the performance hasn't been given yet, Jalonen updates.
Great Coralliria is born with the power of children and adults - in the mushrooms of the performance, you're studying the gestures of mushrooms and seahorses
In other spaces, the Great Coralliriutta collective got its first night in Hamburg last spring and last Saturday it was presented for the second time in Finland, this time in Kanneltalo.
Like the group's previous works, the Great Corallirie is an act built from the beginning to the end, together with the public.
But this time, a clear-cut performance is also being built, refreshing and crystallizing the observations made at the beginning of the exercises.
In the theatre clubs, orchestrated magic is sufficient for children's participants.
The child's perspective has already been involved in the preparation phase of the work.
Still, the Great Corallirie isn't a children's performance, it's a performance that adults and children do in collaboration.
It provides adults with information and observations about the way children receive information and do art.
Children's ability to throw themselves into exercises and joint clips also witnesses the distance between adults and children.
The great Coralliriut is somewhat reminiscent of satubalet, fitness circuit and nature-related awareness-raising, but ultimately reflects in other, non-human conditions around visits.
The great Corallirie begins to explore the movements of corals, as well as those living on the corallirium.
Six different fitness circuits teach, among others, the gestures of cruelty and seahorse.
Finally, there's a barely an hour-long performance, where music, lights, as well as glossy paints and costumes help you familiarize yourself with the life of the coral reef.
There are both diving people in the great Koralliriuta, who observe the life of the coralliriut and the corals being looked at.
There are also bodies looking at corals.
Looks and observations pointed in many directions make the proposition dense and life sparkle.
Ollapa the landscape of some animal, the landscape of the landscape, and the other body or landscape that looks at the body - and all this at the same time.
For children, it doesn't seem like anything difficult.
In other spaces, the group aims at a boundary of thinking and action, which is challenging to get to when the group is composed of both children and adults.
On the other hand, the involvement of children makes it more significant.
After the workshop, Sitrator organises a silent demonstration on behalf of endangered corals.
The devastation that transcends man's understanding should not be allowed to harden, although it could be difficult to comprehend the significance of exercising one's own sympathies in the face of the devastation.
In other spaces, it has built its work in such a way that it respects the diversity of life, even in a political gesture.
There are other generations, there are different kinds of awareness, other species and their future generations, whose wonder and cut it ravages space.
Children adult too quickly - I'm happy that there were no smartphones in my childhood
Today's children and young people are more irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking all the time younger and younger.
I believe that children should be children throughout their childhood, and don't mess around their lives because of stars and sex, because others say they do.
I was hammered when my guy told me that he had had to apply for his fifth-grade sister to have a "boy's squirrel" on the weekend.
When she came to apply for her humbled sister, she told her sex experiences from that evening.
I couldn't imagine my own sister in the same situation, because we've been told and warned throughout our childhood that the days shouldn't be touched and sex is adult stuff.
I hope that contemporary children will be able to live a decent childhood, and they wouldn't need to adult too early because of the group pressure created by guys.
I'm constantly seeing younger girls on Instagram, who are pictured makeup naked and revealing clothes on their heads.
Snapchatti is used in the evening to capture and send revealing images.
It's even harder for girls to guess what age they are.
Contemporary 13-year-olds can easily look 18-year-olds and parents.
My childhood consisted of playing in the woods and playing board games.
I'm happy that there were no smartphones in my childhood.
I was allowed to be a child for many years, and I didn't need to think about what others were thinking about me.
YLE: authorities told the State Department that the case of Airiston Helmi did not relate to national security
According to Ilkka Kanervan, I'm interviewing, protective police and defence forces visited the Committee on Defence and Foreign Affairs earlier this week.
The Finnish state leadership has been told that Airiston Helme's investigation is not currently related to national security, but to organised crime, Yle announced.
Ilkka Kanerva (kok), chairman of the Defense Committee for Yle, confirmed the information of the anonymous sources.
According to Kanervan, the defence forces and the conservation police visited the Committee on Defence and Foreign Affairs this week to report on the ongoing investigation.
This is considered primarily economic crime.
They were quite strict about not speculating that there would be anything else here, Kanerva commented in Ylen's interview.
According to above, the seized material has so far found no evidence of a link to national security, but the investigation is only on its territory.
We can't yet know what can be revealed from there, one of Ylen's interviewees says.
A week ago, the vast homesmanship that began in the archipelago of Turku and the continent has raised the question of whether the investigation is simply about economic crime or a threat to Finland's internal security.
Iltalehti lifted a jutun earlier this week, going through the allegations, both for and against.
Video: dream paint saved Liverpool's defeated series
Liverpool's 100% Valioliigan start came to an end, but it was still a more satisfying team for the 1-1 game at Stamford Bridgela.
Sunday will be a level year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and departed for a 1-0 guest victory.
That's when Pep Guardiola's combination sent a signal throughout Valioliiga that City was now in fact.
Everyone remembers how the last season ended.
And certainly Liverpool manager Jûrgen Klopp arrived at the same ideal Länsi-Lontoose.
The Reds had started Valioliigan with six consecutive victories.
Liverpool started stronger and Virgil van Dijk, in particular, seemed to dominate his own field end alone.
Chelsea, in turn, had a fine liigacup guest victory from Anfield Road underneath Wednesday.
Then Eden Hazard rose from the exchange bench to settle the match with a fabulous individual performance.
Now, of course, Hazard was involved immediately from the early minutes.
In the 25th minute she first blasted in a small space triangle with Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
Eventually, the Croate saw Hazardin eating ahead and sent this completely weighted unwritten.
Hazard drifted a little to the ship of the penalty zone, but bombed from there a perfect left foot to the back corner of the bet.
Pool's brassivahti Alisson was a little slow in his fight and didn't get like his finger on the ball.
Klopp certainly felt the defeat position lightly unfair because almost immediately afterwards Antonio Rüdiger putsasi Mo Salah's guidance on the ground.
In the second episode, Chelsea-veskari Kepa also got into action.
Baskivahti quickly reacted to Sadio Mané's appeal and pushed the ball from the root of the tolp into a corner pot.
On the other hand, Alisson zeroed in his throw-through of Hazarde.
The guests' best place came in 72nd minute, when James Milner found Bobby Firminon in his focus.
But Brassitähden's bucket was directed towards David Luizi, who saved the fathers' leadership position.
Neither lasted in the 89th minute, when exchange man Daniel Sturridge got free to shoot 25 yards.
Sturridge played in his old home stadium, and the attacker bombed the top corner of the unresistant bet in honor of it.
Liverpool's 100% league initiative came to an end with a 1-1 game, but it's still in the league - together with Manchester City.
Chelsea is also strictly involved in the championship two points behind the tip.
In the Kellon transfer debate, the potes are deep
I remember when someone's magazine a decade ago asked different Finnish influencers what divides the people of Finland.
Juice Leskisen's answer remained the only one: Nen head.
Some have a nose-head in their surname, and some don't.
Jakolinjojahan can only be born to me, and here was one of the bidders.
In the EU, Finland has achieved an abandonment of the annual clock movement.
Very many agree that the twice-a-year movement of clocks has been a homma of hummingbirds and caused a wide range of problems.
Ultimately, this achievement feels at least the easiest phase of the solution in Finland, although it has not been easy.
The hardest thing now is to resolve what the clock will eventually end: the current summer or winter time, or some other time zone.
Here's what the people can also say on the otakantaa.fi page.
The poll has been opened by the Department of Transport and Communications and will be open on Friday, 12 October.
The conversation is fiercely conducted on coffee tables and social media, and everyone has their words to say.
Defending Talviaika justifies their position with the effect of morning injury on people's well-being and summer time, the afternoon's influence on people's outdoor well-being and through it on their well-being.
Both have a solid supporter and a good argument.
According to surveys, morning light rhythmises man's day and gives a mistake.
On the other hand, if you don't particularly suffer from awakening in the dark, increase the luminosity of people's movements outdoors and provide better opportunities for autumn yards, for example.
The amount of supplementary earnings after normal working day has already been calculated to one hour.
I'd rather take both of them, but evil yes to our location in the northern corner of the Earth, we can't do anything.
The winters are too dark and summers too bright for many anyway.
For a typical debate on the subject, there is a strong opposition to one's own views and another's views.
The counterparty's arguments aren't exactly listening, because the most important thing is what it feels like about itself.
Because there's opinion from almost everyone, it's somewhat vain to try to turn another decision.
It's where you're going to waste the crutches.
The subject is terribly easy to argue, because it doesn't require a great deal of panic and justification is enough for a mutu-tuntuma.
Similar types of issues are usually disputed with the most fierce and equally fruitlessness.
Harmit it, if the wrong option becomes a complaint, but doesn't adapt to it either.
And it always offers a suitable scapegoat, too, if life feels attractive.
Josba fought täpär's guest victory
Josba's first guest-game salibandyn Divarissa produced Nurmon Jymy against full three series points.
Josba left Seinäjoki for a home trip with a riemukas 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory.
Nurmo was still leading by goal at the start of the third batch, but Josba applied for compositions and recycled men in chains.
In time, 50.47 brothers Eetu and Juuso Lehtiniemi drink 6-5 winning goal.
Crucial minutes of balance were played in the icebergs of both teams.
Josban's most effective was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2 + 1).
Kakkosketju was otherwise overwhelming when Teemu Tuhkanen (1 + 1), Jere Kaartinen (1 + 0) and Jere Kettunen (1 + 0) also hit.
Miika Kosonenkin (1 + 0) also played in the cake chain at the birth of her goal.
Josballa has six points after three series rounds.
The next against will be O2-Jyväskylä visitors in two weeks.
Enon church Sunday's 200th anniversary
The 200th anniversary of Eno's church will be celebrated tomorrow, Sunday, in part in a very sad atmosphere.
The incineration of the church of Kiihtelysvaara a week ago was a shock.
Eno's church was guarded after the fire on two nights.
Despite the pain, today is still a place of celebration.
Although that's not what anyone would like, Eno's church is now the oldest church in Joensuu's congregation.
The church in the middle of the village has always been Enon's heart despite all the world's municipal and other alliances.
The family starts at Enon church today at 10 a.m.
Then move to the church house to the Karelian pit table.
The programme has a long day of everything, both inside and outside.
For example, the church building can be familiarized with the retired, 37-year-old congressional star of Ari Räsäsen's mentoring.
The church's birthday party also marks the end of one era.
Already abolished, the church house, built in 1982, keeps its doors open today for the last time.
Markku Koistinen, the captain, says, is now in the democratic spaces of the former municipality.
The church house was destroyed by indoor air problems, but the church has been standing in a healthy place for 200 years already.
Elon Musk steals from Tesla's government spokesman's place - Petos accusations agreed at $40 million
Tesla, an electric car manufacturer, and Elon Musk, CEO of the company, have agreed their legal dispute with the sec, the U.S. Securities Markets Authority.
The sec suspected Musk's perpetrators of securities fraud, and Musk was in danger of being excluded from the company he founded.
But Musk is allowed to continue as Tesla's CEO.
Instead, Musk will have to steal from the Tesla board chairman for three years.
The company is forced to hire an outside government chairman.
Musk is also facing stricter scrutiny.
According to the agreement, Teslan must employ two independent leaders and monitor Musk's communication more closely in the future.
In addition, Tesla and Musk will both pay $20 million (about €17 million) to reconcile the case.
"The decision is meant to prevent new market failures and the damage caused to Tesla's shareholders," says manager Steven Peikin of the sec.
The case caught its beginning in August, when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might pull the company out of the stock exchange.
Musk also wrote that the company's financing was secured.
Tviitti instantly raised Tesla's share price.
The sec suspected Musk's guilty of securities fraud.
According to the agency, the tviitti was lieutenant and misleading, and Musk had not spoken about the arrangement with the company's other management or potential financiers.
In practice, the agency accused Musk of misleading investors.
The sec announced on Friday that it was challenging the company and Musk's law.
Sec told himself that Musk should be sentenced to fines and that he should be prohibited from continuing to operate under the direction of stock exchanges.
The sec's challenge affected investors, and Tesla's share went into a sharp drop.
More than 800 people killed in Indonesia's raid and tsunami
The number of people killed in Indonesia's earthquake and subsequent tsunami has risen to at least 832, reports the country's disaster agency, according to AFP.
The number of deaths is believed to still increase, because it's time to find out the deaths.
According to Vice-President Jusuf Kalla, the final figure may rise to thousands.
Friday's earthquake ravaged a tsunami that attacked the city of Palu on the island of Sulawes.
The tsunami was issued immediately after the excruciation, but was quickly cancelled.
According to authorities, almost everyone who is aware is at least so far from Palu.
Rescue officials are concerned, among other things, about the Donggala area near the centre of the recession, where the situation remains largely unclear.
Already, several people are known to have died.
Calls for assistance from ruins
The Indonesian army has been alerted to help rescue workers seek victims.
President Joko Widodon, who arrived in the devastation zone today, called on soldiers to continue rescue efforts without delay days and nights.
One of the centerpieces of the rescue is the hotel in Palussa, which is still believed to have 50-60 people in the ruins.
Muhammad Syaugi, head of the Office for Pelastustös, told us that one man alive was caught in the night, from the ruins of the Roa-Roa hotel favoured by business travellers.
We also heard people's requests for help, he told me.
According to Syaug, a heavy grinding aircraft would be quickly exhausted in the recession and tsunami zone.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their closest in disappearances.
Help, you in Palus and the neighborhood.
My friend's family members are still covered, one writer vetoed on Facebook.
Politicians' phone numbers leaked into the hands of disruptives in Britain
Many British politicians were subjected to harassment when their contacts were announced due to flaws in the application's encryption.
The disturbances reached, among other things, the ministers' telephone numbers.
It was an application used in the government's British Conservative Party Party meeting.
Par exemple, Michael Gove, Minister for the Environment, Restaurant and Rural Affairs, driving Brexit, and Boris Johnson, a former foreign minister, faced harassment.
Several MPs received harassment claims.
Because of the app's encryption, the audience gained hands on politicians' profiles, which were on the Conservative Party's annual mobile app.
The audience got into the profiles by using the politician's email address. which was easily accessible online.
The profile-recording managed to view and edit the material stored in the profile.
Someone managed to turn Boris Johnson's profile photo into a porn photo and title solvable for a moment.
Michael Goven's profile photo was changed by mediamoguli Rupert Murdoch's photo.
The Guardian columnist Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that the meeting app allows you to log on to other people's profiles via these email addresses.
Then you can look at the profile person's contact information and even if you send messages in this name.
The meeting app made every journalist, politician and participant's phone number public, Foster criticized.
The Conservative Party informant apologized for the information.
He said that the technical problems have been solved and the application is now operating safely.
The British Information Office (ICO) supports information.
The app was created by the Australian Crown Comms company.
The Labour Party in the opposition criticises the lack of confidence in the Conservative Party in security matters.
The Wall Suomi tournament audience features a large array of populated Poles every week
Eye-catching viewers attracted attention to the reactions of the studio audience of The Wall Suomi.
The world's rapidly spreading American format The Wall ranched as a Finnish version for Nelo last Saturday.
Heikki Paasosen's hosted game show has been described in Poland in the same studio, where other international productions are made in the form.
In the Polish studio, the possibilities of description were exceptional, as the big 12-metre-high game wall of the formate demanded space from the space.
During the start-up period, social media raised the studio audience of the programme, which was operated as Polish.
On Twitter, there would be a debate about whether the studio perhaps understood Polish people sitting in a Finnish game for nothing.
Unne Sormunen, head of Nelose's domestic programs, illuminates the issue for Iltalehti.
She says the studio audience has players' closeness, other Finns, foreign Finns living in Poland, as well as Polish viewers.
The audience is composed of international fans in Finland's production, than audiences of The Wall seasons described in the same production space in other countries.
In Finland, there are such guardians, so-called professionals, who visit different programs in descriptions, Sormunen background.
He recalls that watching the game in itself isn't so difficult, although he wouldn't understand the language in which it is played.
It's easy to distinguish between red and green balls falling from the wall.
But for foreign-language studios, there are interpreters at the scene who are carrying out translation work.
There are two interpreters that interpret the whole time of events as a simultaneous blow to the studio director.
And the studio director then instructs the audience and tells you what to go through there, for example, and what the situation is going through, Sormunen says.
He compares the situation with how David Hasselhoff was delivered back in domestic production.
A few years ago, David Hasselhoff was involved in Talent Finland's descriptions of us in Finland.
She became the subject of simultaneous expression throughout her life, and she knew everything the descriptions spoke of as Finnish, Sormunen's sum.
Japan's southern murders of typhoon are moving towards the main island - authorities warn against landslides and floods
Authorities are also warning about potential landslides and floods.
At least 50 people have been injured in Taifuuni Tramis, but according to the authorities, big injuries have been avoided and no information about the death penalty is yet available.
On the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so fierce that it has turned cars around.
According to the NHK broadcaster, people have been evacuated to shelters, and electricity has bitten from more than 300,000 households.
More than a thousand flights have been cancelled, and bullet trains are in place because of the storm.
The storm is expected to strike close to Oska for half a day in the Finnish era.
The capital of Tokyo isn't directly on the storm route, but there are harsh winds and rains.
Trains have been cancelled today in Tokyo.
According to Weather scientists, Trami squeezes Japan until Monday.
The sky of the Ässians darkened further
The Ässian early season has been bad.
The sky darkened already for almost a picture when the team disappeared on Saturday in their home field for Vaasan Sportille reading 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1).
The Pori people now have five consecutive losses, with scores from six rounds in a total of two.
Nobody's assis defender or two lower chain player has yet scored a goal.
The pressures are also growing throughout.
Against Sportia, the audience was all hallowed already at the stage when the game was like half away.
Six games are only played, and of course there's no reason to give up.
Of course, there should be some concern, because we played a little bit.
En particulier, the second batch performance was disgracefully bad, Jarno Kärki, who made 1 + 2 for the ace, told him.
For Sportil, the victory naturally tasted.
The team had a perjantai underneath the game, so it would have thought it would have been visible.
Perhaps it was visible, but the ace couldn't take advantage of it.
Leipäday's visitor number continued to increase
Leipäpäivän mother Pirkko Hyvärinen wonders the audience of the event watched by the big salin.
Somehow it thought that maybe not this year so much would come, Hyvärinen reflects on the morning.
In the autumn of 2017, parallel to the Leipäpäivä, the Traktorikynnön SM races were held, so perhaps the expectation would be that the audience could slightly even diminish from the previous year.
But the other went; the corridors were already thickly supported before 10, the vendors told the end of the products, the news cart was sold more than nearly 500 doses and the number of cars was Hyvärinen heard rising.
The estimate of the number of visitors has been around 6000, Hyvärinen reports later in the afternoon.
The five hours of the morning and afternoon were particularly accommodating for families with children, which in turn attracts them to a record-breaking spot.
Additionally, Hyvärinen estimated that the event would reach even further.
Vendors also cut Liperi from bigger areas every year.
This year, almost a hundred rapporteurs, sellers of craftsmanship, baking and harvesting products had arrived at their breadcrumbs.
Leipäpäivän mother PIrkko Hyvärinen admired the audience from watching the hall.
A hundred were blessed at the beginning of Leipäpäivä.
In the children's series, Teija Kiviniemen's beautiful bread won the vote.
11 different types of bread arrived at the Children's bread competition.
Marjatta Vepsäläinen, winner of the Ruisleipäkilpailu, spent the day in the martyrs' café.
7 x the most beautiful lights - here you identify a good lamp
Wake up the space to life, create the right atmosphere in the interior and read the book eyes tirelessly.
For good lighting, it's worth the satsata.
We collected together three good reasons to bet on the lighting.
Tips were given by Tarja Jokiniemi, sales and marketing director of Innolux.
Do a service to your eyes
The significance of illumination is growing, the more ageing there is behind.
Adequate light can help with problems that many come with age, as the vision accuracy diminishes and the distraction suffers increasingly.
Parents are also growing need for light.
The hexagonal needs light three times more than twenty-four.
So it's worthwhile satsata already for health reasons to treat the effects of light and the characteristics of the luminaire.
A good lighting gives enough light, but not häikäise, Jokiniemi vinkkaa.
Create beauty around you
The beautiful interior can only be seen with the correct lighting solutions.
The interior of the moment has a choice.
The favourite is a japanese style that combines gesture, scandal and japaneseness.
On the other hand, the modern and cutting retro style, inspired by the 70s, has also risen to the boom with its colours, metallic different colours or ice cream colours.
The authenticity fascinates in the same way as the home's other furnishings.
The materials now show tree, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Illustration of Your Personality
On the other hand, the home is better now than before, and the interior has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, you want to tailor your own home, the courageous lighter with a story to tell.
People are clearly applying for Finnish and Nordic products, the origin and designer of which are known.
So be very design-conscious, Jokiniemi says.
Not necessarily buying the latest trend lights at home, but a timeless classic, for which many years have been saved.
Certain types of timeless, jewellery and elegant classics keep their pint from year to year, Jokiniemi says.
Thank you and vision!
KooKoo showed a door to a Canadian attacker after three games
KooKoon and attacker Brendan O'Donnell's roads are eroded.
The Canadian attacker played a total of three Liiga matches without tehopists in orange, KooKoo says in his announcement.
O'Donnell moved to KooKooho in August with a one-year contract, which included a probation period lasting until the end of September.
Last season, the 26-year-old attacker played at the KHL in Kunlund Red Star's ranks as well as at the KHL's farming VHL in krs Heilongjiang.
O'Donnell's new club is not yet known.
Pelimies want to show an example in recycling - goods leave the world in recycling boxes, plastic switched to paper
In addition to the games, the Pelimies' specialist movement recycles packaging materials.
The products of the customers of the Kivijalka trade are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in paper bags made from recycling material.
Products ordered from online stores are packaged in packages from importers, for example.
All the packages that come to us are going to be renewed.
We may use boxes 10 times, as long as the package is in the condition that you can use it, Ville Puurula Oulun Pelimieh tells us.
As an embalming material, the company usually uses newspapers and other similar recycling materials.
Kuplamuov is avoided as far as possible.
In the near future, we're supposed to move to recycling material.
The movement wants to set an example to others.
Recycling is not an extra effort, according to Puurula.
It's not a big problem to start recycling.
It comes with financial savings when, for example, cardboard boxes are used as new ones.
Recycling is naturally suitable for Peliman's activities, as, alongside new products, the main product range of the movement includes games and equipment used.

Russia's intelligence service sabotage operation has a long tradition
There is no reason to assume that the Russian Federation's foreign intelligence SVR or military intelligence gru would have abandoned this approach.
During the Soviet Union, so-called DRGs specialised in sabotage.
The name comes from the Russian-language words diversionno-razvedyvatelnaja group: sabotage and intelligence group.
Assistants operating in the KGB West of the Soviet Union's Security Service are preparing detailed plans for important sabotage sites, says Vassili Mitrohin, archive manager west of the KGB (1922- 2004).
His information was published in Christopher Andrew's books in the late 1990s and early 2000s
The targets included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil refineries and gas pipelines.
In Germany, the KGB acquired uniforms and accessories for DRG groups for cover operations in Bundeswehrin, railway, strip guards and workers.
This trick was used by Russian parachute soldiers in Crimea in February 2014: they dressed in local Ukrainian police mellak gear, created inspection stations for roads leading from the peninsula to Ukraine, and differentiated Crimea about it.
During the Cold War, agents handed sabotage teams to the ground accessories packages containing mines, explosives, blazers and messages.

HPK keeps Riskan in line for the rest of the season, Lehtisen's probationary period ended
Mika Toivola, sports director of Hämeenlinna's HPK, says Filip Riska (centre) has been important for the team in starting, playing alivoima and playing a defensive role in the vicious circuit.
Filip Riska, who played in the early autumn probationary period, will continue with Hämeenlinna's HPK for the final season.
The success of experienced Riskan, 33, in the roles offered to him convinced the following.
Filip has played an important role for us in returning starts, in the power play and in the defensive role of the vicious circuit.
Although there is still some improvement to be found, it is good for the young team to hold on to such an experienced player, HPK sports director Mika Toivola commented in the club's briefing.
According to my hope, Riskan's value rises in the ice hockey League's settlement games while playing.
Riska, a central attacker from St. Petersburg, has played a league hockey earlier in JYPiss, Lukossa and Sporti.
Winger Oskari Lehtinen, instead, was left without a contract after a probationary period.
Today on TV: climber was left dead twice
The American Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: my Journey Home From Everest is based on a man's own experiences.
The evening movie has been made on their basis.
Everest now gets his first night on Finnish TV.
In May 1996, a devastating snowstorm surprised climbers Mount Everestillä.
Baltasar Kormákur's 2015 direction tells the story of a survivor battle that has been dealt with in grain.
Movies - and documentaries - have been made of tragedy before.
Tosita events are going through here too.
22 years ago, the world's highest mountain took the spirit of eight climbers.
Two of them were experienced leaders of expeditions: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It was Hall who served as Weathers' guide.
The spirit of Weathers may have saved the eye surgery carried out before leaving Nepal.
As a result of it and air pressure, he lost his visibility, which is why the top conquest had to be left in the middle.
Rob Hall continued his journey and didn't return anymore.
But Weathers' struggle for life and death had only just begun.
As the storm rose, he eclipsed and no longer found himself back in the camp.
When the man came to search, he was found in such a bad condition that he was not believed to survive.
Weathers was abandoned to death.
But like a miracle on the store, she still got to her feet and found others.
The evil Weathers, who were pale, were thought to continue to die, and once again he was left behind his own happiness.
Obviously, contrary to other expectations, Beck Weathers stayed alive.
At some point, even the climbers began to believe in the possibility of being given assistance.
In the film, Beck Weathers is presented by Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer Jake Gyllenhaal.
Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson are seen in other roles.
Today is celebrated the 200-year-old Enon church
Eno's 200-year-old church has been celebrated today in a church.
The church was inaugurated on 4 October 1818, and a whole family celebration was prepared for Sunday in honour of the anniversary.
The celebrations began at Eno's church at 10 a.m. with a family member, after which the offer has had a Karelian pitopöydän antimia in Eno's church house.
The church was full.
517 people were involved in the family.
Enon churchman Armi Rautavuori was delighted that people had come to church so much.
It's a great joy for a long time yet and gives strength to work, Rautavuori (pictured) says.
The fire of the church of Kiihtelysvaara has touched many, and it was not ignored in the 200th anniversary of Enon's parish.
Eno's church is now the oldest church in Joensuu's evangelical Lutheran churches after being destroyed by fire.
The wooden church of Kiihtelysvaara was completed in 1770.
In the morning, a raid was held in danger of climbing, silenced and remembered a church destroyed in the fire.
Pictures and videos: the medicine avoided its power in Greece - the sea disappeared and the street turned into a river
A powerful hurricane-type syymyrsky rushed from lunch to Greece on Saturday.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or the median, has been named Zorbaksi.
The Greek Meteorological Institute has issued a red weather warning to the Attica, Peloponnese, Joonian Islands, Cyclades and Crete regions.
The images taken from the area show plenty of flooding around Greece.
The video, published on Twitter, shows how a river has suddenly appeared between houses in the town of Kiaton in the region of Korinthia instead of the street due to flooding.
In the second video, you can see how the car has been driven by floodwaters.
In the southern part of Peloponneso's peninsula, a fierce wind caused a strong sightseeing.
The Finnish Athens Embassy instructs people on its Facebook page to book a storm in Greece.
The embassy calls for a follow-up of foundation information and guidance from local authorities.
The Mediterranean hurricane, i.e. the median, brings handsome rains and even flood danger.
According to CNN, according to a survey published in 2011, médicaments only appear once or twice a year throughout the world, typically on September-October roads, when the temperature in the sea is still high.
The now blowing storm left floods in Tunisia and Libya before continuing its journey towards the north and Europe.
Concern in Greece has also been caused by refugee camps on islands like Lesboksella.
Thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in camps have limited access to decent protection.
Les zones destructrices by landslides in the surroundings of Athens will also remain under the storm during the summer.
In Greece, late November, too, the median grimaced.
The sea shouldn't go now, flights still on schedule - thousands of Finns are currently holidaying on Greek islands threatened by Syymyrsky
The sea-facing expeditions should be cancelled and even walking should be careful not to see branches or other bulkheads flying on the storm.
Such instructions have been distributed to a fair 3,500 Finnish weekend holidaymakers in Greece through the Sun Trips.
The instructions come in need, as even the Zorbas storm that climbs into the monsters is projected to be hiding in the Greek islands this weekend.
For example, near the island of Crete, the speed of wind can rise up to 45 metres per second in the tree.
Rain increases the weather's penalties.
All those travelling from Greece to Finland through Sundays and Tui who have announced their telephone numbers have been warned, according to tour organisers, of hard wind text messages.
In the air still sun and heat
According to Inka Ikosen, an expert on solar travel communication, holiday destinations have been avoided by the worst.
Flights, for example, have descended and risen according to the normal timetable.
That's how we follow the situation all the time.
Safety ahead.
Antonia Schroderus, a media outlet, says their flights have also gone on schedule.
We are constantly in touch with our staff.
At least Kreeta was still calm, she told early Saturday.
The subsidies currently have a total of fair 1,500 Finnish tourists on the most popular Greek islands, namely Rodoks and Kreeta.
Additionally, a few hundred passengers are holidaying in smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm on the Isle of Kos reaches Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon, Rodoksel had mocked the sun and the temperature pained to 27 degrees, the Ikonen of the Sun Trips reports.
Zorbaksen is estimated to be moving next to Turkey's enormous, though slightly mitigated.
We've already been in touch with Turkey and our staff there, and we've checked, for example, the number of Finns flying to Antalya Tuilla, Schroderus says.
Shirly Karvisella and Janni Hussi completely identical evening costumes in the missifinale - that's how they react to the situation
Mediapersoona and fitness-kaunotar Janni Hussi arrived in the Miss Suomi finals on Saturday in an open-air afternoon dress.
Hussi tells his acquisition of Meslewil.
I went on the move and decided to rely on the professionals, who found me a quite magnificent costume for this evening, Hussi smiles.
Exactly the same silver evening costume had yet to be chosen by drinker Shirly Karvinen as well.
The twins themselves also noticed similar apartments and took to the situation with laughter.
Karvinen told Ilta-Sanomi qu' she had become busy in the preparations, and she was forced to put on the plane.
Hussi serves as a backstage and red carpet drinker in the missifinale, and he jutuses the front-row stars who arrive.
Hussi has fresh migration behind him as he moved from Kamp to Jätkäsaare on Friday
I'm going to stay there for the time being, let's see what happens.
Essentially, the new apartment has its own work room, Hussi reflected.
Before his emigration, Hussi was alone in Greece.
It was wonderful, I was only in a week's hotel without leaving anywhere.
I got a flunssan when I was stressful, but otherwise the holiday was really successful, Hussi tells.
Shirly Bear's use on the plane raised a lot of attention - collected the curious eyes of pensioners
The drummer and 2016 Miss Suomi Shirly Karvinen told Miss Suomi in the red carpet of the finale that she had enough to do with radio trains and Love Island Suomi photographs.
Hurriedly enough, even to the extent that Karvinen arrived at the finale directly from Finnair's flight.
Meikkasin and I installed the hair on the machine.
That's the glamoury of it.
Changing the evening costume at home, Carvinen laughs.
Karvinen tells himself to pull the makeup among pensioners.
His preparation also sparked the attention of passengers.
I had a big mirror and I saw people's eyes from the mirror.
My makeup was to amuse others at least.
Karvinen flies to Spain once a week.
In Marbella, he spends about a few days at once.
Karvinen tells herself to enjoy her pest as a Love Island Finnish drinker.
He describes his experience of being halt too so far.
Karvinen tells himself he's gone on Friday to mock the program's sinkkuja.
It's somehow true raw.
They are people's authentic feelings, Karvinen describes the feelings of the program's hammocks.
How's the overpolven boots of the tree?
Three perfect examples
The classic garments are clothing pieces that work from season to second in asus compared to asus.
Often classics are decades old, but sometimes modern individuals are accessible.
A few years ago, the overcrowded boots, rising as a hitter of the syys and winter season, have never disappeared.
By his name, the boots that survive over the knee repeat as stylish from year to year and sesong to second.
The looking boots share the opinions of the users, but the courageous model is worth trying, well - courageously.
Ylipolven boots, in fact, suitable for whatever housing units.
Then it's about jeans, pits, stylish or shirt, boots' simple leather or tekonahkapinta works.
Long boots look good in festive looks as well as in everyday life.
Black boots suit well for hemp housing as well.
They suitably balance the feminism of pink, cuddly pliers and hemp, muhka neule.
A rich but autumn-style arkiasu to a romantic taste.
A strong and slightly retro-hensive housing set comes from a long copper-brown velvet, a super-pop boots, looking earrings and a niitti pickle suit.
Although there's a certain refinement in the super-pop boots, they're perfectly compatible with a t-shirt, long shorts and trendy flags.
I love easy and yet so stylish!
Two robotic cars start traffic in Espoo
They were running for the rest of the year and taking passengers, the city of Espoo informs.
Otaniemen's robot cars operate in the role of a bus simulator, as next spring the area is scheduled to start traffic with robot buses.
The project will develop and pilot a year-round robotic vehicle movement, as well as testing the technical performance of vehicles in Finland's circumstances.
The experiment will figure out how robotic cars stay on the existing street network.
At the same time, the city offers robot bus developers an opportunity to develop technology in a real environment, says Johanna Nyberg, chief executive responsible for traffic management.
For the first time, robotic cars travel completely automatically among other traffic without special traffic arrangements.
An assistant passenger sitting in tears is always responsible for vehicle safety.
The vehicles sensed their environment throughout with several different sensors and assessed whether the driveway was free.
If it isn't, they will interpret whether a discovered obstacle vehicle, bicycle or, for example, snowflake, says Harri Santamala, CEO of Sensible 4, responsible for the development of robot transport.
Robotic cars travel throughout the autumn three days a week: Tuesdays 13-15.30, Wednesdays 10-15 and Thursdays 10-15.
Robotic cars stop at six stops along the route, taking passengers to tears.
Stops for robotic cars recognise the parking lot.
You'll be more sure to get to Otakaarella station number 1.
The Mokoma band basisti fell from the valley in the middle of a bow and injured
The Mokoma group will brief you on their Facebook page about the surprising situation at the Tampere Pakkahuone.
The Mokoma band keikka Tampereen Pakkahuone received a dramatic turn on Saturday when the band's basistist Santtu Hämäläinen dropped out of the valley in the middle of the performance.
The situation happened when the band was pulling the final pieces of the evening.
Hämäläinen's wrist broke.
The band informs on their Facebook page.
"You're in the spirit!"
Santtu stumbled yesterday in the Pakka Room from the valley in the last biis and broke his wrist.
Let's hope for a quick improvement on metallivelje!
The remainder of the tour is carried out by a bookkeeper, the pages read.
Mokoma's fans respond worriedly to the photo update, where basisti-Santtu lies in a plaster in his hand.
This news has been expected, it was quite hard to worry how badly it happened.
The relief is great, the bones will thankfully improve over time.
Tsemppi and a quick recovery for Santa and a good tour for the rest of the bands plus a fan!
And thank you for yesterday, the gorgeous keikka was, but you promise to leave such a strong dramatic keikka away? writes one fan.
Police oversee hunt in North Karelia and Sava
On Friday and Saturday, the East Finnish Police Department conducted hunt surveillance with the Metsähallitukse and the Finnish Riistake Centre in North Karelia and Ylä-Savo, police department's excavators told social media on Saturday Yeah.
The main focus of surveillance was on hunting legitimacy and permissiveness.
Each hunter was inspected by a hunting card and a hunting permit required by the state.
In addition, hunting arms possession figures as well as patrol numbers permitted for self-insulated weapons used in canalisation were examined.
According to the police, 112 hunters were inspected during the surveillance and only one hunter was met during the surveillance, missing the required hunting permit.
The hunter was ordered 12 days' allowance for unauthorised catch.
In addition, 133 vehicle drivers were blown up by the police and two of them were suspected of being rattled.
In addition, less than five traffic offences were dealt with in a fine procedure, police once.
To sum up, hunters respect the permissibilities of hunting very well.
Many hunters were surprised by surveillance.
One hunter said that "I've been hunting in the area for 50 years and this was the first time someone is checking the permits."
The eastern Finnish police department will continue hunting surveillance in the autumn, along with other supervisors.
Mykkänen leaves Turkey to watch Syrian quota refugee selection
Interior Minister Kai Mykkänen (kok.) will travel to Turkey in the next few days to monitor the choice of quota refugees coming to Finland.
Finland has decided to take 530 Syrian refugees from Turkish refugee camps this year.
Selection trips are usually made a couple of times a year, with representatives from the Migration Agency, the Ministry of Labour and the Economy, as well as from the police.
The delegation is already conducting interviews in Turkey.
UNHCR, the UN refugee organisation, chooses people in a particularly vulnerable position.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered to be in refugee camps in a particularly vulnerable position, such as single-parent families, disabled and sick, women and children.
More people are elected to the group of people coming to Finland than the quota is because, in practice, some remain without arriving for different reasons.
Mykkänen will also meet NGOs operating at the border between Turkish Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu and Syria.
Ilkka Salmi, the chief executive of the Interior Ministry, is also involved.
Talked about raising the quota
Finland has taken quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees a year.
The quota was 1 050 per year for a couple of years, but no agreement has since emerged in the government to raise it.
Kokoomus has been in favour of raising the quota, but the project has most recently crashed into blue resistance.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) recently presented a gradual increase in the quota to 1,500-2,000 people a year.
Mykkäsen's visit during this government season is the first that the Interior Minister will do on the ground to monitor the choice of quota refugees.
Previous interior ministers Petteri Orpo (kok.) and Paula Risikko (kok.) were able to move on to their new duties before the visits were arranged.
Finland receives €10,000 in support from the EU for every particularly vulnerable refugee.
Now you're going to searches - no longer known, whether you're crying or laughing
Karjalainen announced last Saturday a bill to amend the Animal Protection Act.
On the article, it was perceived that the draft bill initially bans the keeping of all animals that are not separately permitted by ministerial regulation as production animals, pets or otherwise associated with business activities. Yeah.
So everything else is originally banned except for the animals specifically mentioned in the regulation.
If the bill comes to an end, it means that we are rejecting in Western democracies the general principle that the laws separately prohibit activities that compromise the safety of society, or the way.
Now, it's a question of prohibiting everything that the law or regulation doesn't separately permit.
The result of the change is that nothing new can be tested, for example, in business activities, and nothing else can be done before its adoptive law or regulation has been adopted.
The government's activities in lawmaking have generally been weak.
Should it now be taken down the road that, in Finland, everything is prohibited, which is not allowed separately, it is no longer known whether to cry or laugh.
I don't doubt the Animal Protection Act would require an update.
But the law in this direction doesn't fall within democracy.
Unfortunately, I don't know the Constitution very well, but whether it may accept such a "everything is prohibited, which is not permitted by law or regulation separately."
Hopefully, there will be some sensible minister who suspends the progress of such a bill.
Metti Forssell tips: four trendiest breasts in autumn
This autumn's trendy gown comes in.
It looks particularly good just in skirts.
Combine the snake-shaped skirt to the top of the more condensed, such as a bowl or a pair of ordinary t-shirts, so that the population remains stylish.
This autumn's silk is abundantly visible, and particularly the silk skin is one of the trendiest pieces of garment in the season.
Combine your gorgeous silk skin gently with a feminine top or a ring needle pair.
With silk skin, you can play braver and throw yourself on the foot, for example, with the lenkers or the autumn trendy cowboy boats.
It doesn't matter whether it's grey, brown or multicolored, all the squirrel skirts now belong to every woman's must have.
Bravely combine different colours with each other, and cut with the screwdriver on the top of different sizes as well.
For example, the combination of screwdriver and balloon sauce is beautiful.
Asymmetric gems are a wind blow from the summer's height, which can be brought in to autumn.
The asymmetric helmet is both feminine and cut and fits perfectly as early as the festivities.
Alexia baby, 3 months old, murmured in love at Jeren's sylis
In Karalahti's family photo, a lovely three-month-old Alexia baby is rising to the centre of attention.
Nanna Karalahti explains the date of the establishment in Kerava.

Turkey calls for mobile phones to be downloaded for storm
Saturday's Zorba storm in Greece is expected to move to Turkey on Sunday.
On Saturday, meteorologists warned in particular sailors, fishermen and farmers of the country's west coast about the storm in Greece, writes CNN Türk.
Tropical storms are told to move along the coast from the south to the north during the day.
On Saturday, disaster and emergency officials urged citizens to download their mobile phone before the storm and ensure the functioning of the internet connection so that people can get updates of the situation, local news reports Anadolu Ajansi.
People have been urged to stay at home and far from the windows and to move garden furniture away from the wind, for example.
Turkey is expected to have a heavy rain and the wind is expected to blow 28-33 meters per second.
Red weather warning in Greece
On Saturday, the Greek Meteorological Service issued a red weather warning to the regions of South Greece, Attica, Peloponnese, Joonia Islands, Cyclades and Crete.
The foreign ministry and travel agencies in Greece warned the Finns in Greece about the Zorba storm.
The Suomen Ateenan Embassy also published a storm warning.
Tourists were invited to follow the foundations and instructions from local authorities.
A little while ago, when I contacted, there was a strong wind and shattered.
People were ihan peaceful, communications manager Laura Aaltonen of Tui's travel agency told STT on Saturday.
Aaltonen described the situation as similar yet on Saturday night.
By the evening, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had not received any messages about the Finns in distress either.
In Greece, several ports did not operate on Saturday, local news agency Amna told.
Boat trips to the sea were cancelled on Saturday, travel agents told STT.
According to the Finnish Ateenan embassy, temporary disruptions were expected to occur in the aviation and shipping sector.
Finnair was told on Saturday that the weather situation would be actively monitored.
Kimi Räikkönen criticized the cause for Mercedek's superiority over Ferrari
Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen was allowed to admit that the worst competitor, Mercedes, was too hard a piece at the time of Russia's gp.
But there is no reason to panic in the Ferrari camp, the experienced driver estimates.
They were just faster than us, but there's nothing huge about it.
Our car was the best throughout the week-end so far, but they were just too fast, quarter-time and tallitover with Sebastian Vettel clearly missing from the Mercedes boosts, Räikkönen said.
Ferrar had difficulty already in previous cats in Singapore.
Räikkösel was asked what the sudden fall from Mercedek's tears was rightly due to.
They seem to go faster than us - so simple it is.
If I knew the reason for that, we would certainly go at the same pace as they did.
But I don't know it any more than anyone else.
That's always guessing, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Ken knows why?
During time, a rare sensation was seen for Räikkösen's upcoming winter for Sauber.
Charles Leclerc, replacing Räikkösen with Ferrar next season, was seventh, and Marcus Ericsson also appeared in the final time session.
For Sweden's attack, the 10th departure is best for more than three years.
And although in the second driving round five drivers left entirely driven, the end result was still tasty for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging Räikkö's future?
Yes, if you compare where they were from the early season, then the step forward has been big.
There's a different story next year, so let's watch, let's watch.
It was there - Robert Helenius tyrmäsi Erkan Teperin: "Robbe is back"
Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper's match in Stuttgart's evening progressed in flat signs.
The German was in the process of being a more initiative party, but he didn't get a decent hit on the couple.
Clearly more reaching Helenius controlled the match with his hard series, which found themselves very perfect.
The Finnish was also clearly in a better physical condition than Teper.
The solution eventually came in the eighth installment, when Helenius pushed Teperin straight to the left.
The hit was so hard that the conkari who was in front of the home audience didn't even try to rise up from the carpet.
After the victory secured, Helenius fanned quite moderately.
In the Kehäha interview, she initially praised the good atmosphere created by the public and her opponent.
Then, for a moment, she exchanged her tongue of Finnish.
Thank you to all viewers and Finnish incentives.
We were involved in the belt today.
Helenius cheered immediately after the match.
It was a really big victory for Helenius' career.
Perhaps there would be an opportunity to even get into the World Cup match, Helenius commented on Iltalehde before the match.
Instead, the defeat might have ended the entire boxing career.
True when it's come to mind.
Nobody gets younger here anymore, 34-year-old Helenius admitted ahead of Teper's encounter.
Number of victims of Indonesian catastrophe may multiply
According to The Guardian magazine, the country's deputy president calls for a clear rise in the victim's rise.
According to Vice-President Jusuf Kalla, the total number of victims may increase to thousands.
Difficult circumstances
Rescuers are looking for the remains of the injury, as well as for the perpetrators of the worst affected areas of Sulawes Island: the port city of Palu and its neighborhood of Donggala.
So far, all the victims are from Palu, there is still no clarity about Donggala's situation.
Hundreds of people are missing and about 540 have been injured badly.
There are still people in sorted buildings whom rescuers have not been able to get out.
The Roa Roa Hotel in Palussa, for example, is represented.
Rescuers tell the cries of people who remain insulted from the ruins, but the lack of a gripping capacity has delayed the beginning of the rescue.
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo has ordered the army to rescue and destroy.
There is a need for the army and its equipment, because in the disaster zone, electricity and communications connections are in many places different.
Fuel reserves are also on the move.
Miss Suomi finalist's vague answer and long reflection caused laughter
Billnäs Ruuk is currently selecting a new Miss Suomea.
The interview round raised the question for every missifinalist.
The finalists raised the question of the glass bowl on the lava.
Especially the finalist number six Emilia Anttikosken, 23, 's hesitant' answer caused sweets but good-natured laughs at the audience at the scene.
The question posed to Anttikosk had come through Facebook.
User Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what is the latest book the missifinalist has read.
Anttikoski thought his answer well before starting to hesitate.
Thank you for the question, Pirkko-Ella.
The latest book I've read is..., Anttikoski said of the thoughts.
Until Anttikoski continued to answer, the break of worship caused a laugh in the audience:
The last book I've read is...
Yes, I've read books at school!
Certainly something about economics.
So the last book I've read is someone in economics, Anttikoski answered.
After his answer, Anttikoski received devastating aplodes from the audience as a laugh.
Previously missionary, Anttikoski raised attention as he didn't want to pose in underwear because of his principle.
The 2018 Miss Suomi is crowned at 9 p.m., when Miss Suomi Michaela Söderholm is abandoned from the crown last year.
Siken omena-päärynakakku takes language by
This recipe is for you with good, acidic apples from your own back, because the home apple is a shocking price on the store.
The pear may need to be bought, although time for many people is already growing it with the pear tree.
This cake can also only be made of apples if you don't want to buy.
The taste, of course, is more versatile if the cake hits its pear as well.
Peel the apples and pear and remove the seeds.

Status symbols don't attract friends - Four facts of favor
What makes people popular, karismatic or admirable?
The scientists at the University of Sydney, which analysed the matter, have described two species of "coolness" composed of slightly different features: the generally charming coolness and the partly opposite dissident coolness.
Fascinatingly cool people, according to the description of the scientists, had many features considered socially desirable: they were outward-looking, friendly, agreeable and qualified.
For dissidents, however, there was a typical distance, independence, rebellion and blur.
They thirsted for experiences and held little attention to the estimates of outsiders.
Both types coincided with good self-consciousness and a stable emotional life.
Kovic's role is no longer cool: high status in a teenager may not lead to success later in life.
This is what the American study published in the journal Child Development in 2014 tells us.
Young people, who watched early, bileted, applied to the charity's guardians and sought to applaud others, had risen as young adults to spend money and drive into crimes.
In their human relationships, they suffered weaker than their ever-noticed age-tovers.
High-status communicating luksusautos, signs or clocks don't make people cool - or at least a genuinely attractive follow-up.
In a study published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science in August, a majority of people were more ready to be friends with their ordinary market shirt than with those dressed in their brand shirt - despite the fact that most chose to be supported. in the event of a sign shirt again.

Valtteri Bottas tärised and pursued adrenaline in Sochi - will he be Hamilton's helper on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas peeled a little more tens of minutes after his end-of-life Russian gp when he was in front of the media.
The fine round left Lewis Hamilton behind Mercedes's single star and was mentally certainly an important criticism for the Finnishman who collected this season.
Nice round.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he left a round of solutions.
Feels good, tärisen little more, Bottas figured out.
I've only been once this year, in Austria (in the middle), so it's been a long time since.
This track has been good for me before, and I got good rounds again.
Sotsh's radar doesn't make it easy to pass, so the departure is particularly big.
And true, when Bottas was allowed to answer the question of whether he would drive a victory tomorrow or whether there was a Hamilton jeesamen approaching the World Cup title.
My starting point is definitely that I'm trying to win.
Nothing else can happen when you leave the balustrade, Bottas flaunted.
But as a matter of fact, we're fighting for both championships.
Lewis' leadership to Sebastian Vettel is quite big and differentiates me very big, so it's keeping in mind.
Look at what's happening, though, Bottas completed.
Hamilton was genuinely happy about Bottaksen's success after the drive, and Mercedeksen's tallipomo Toto Wolffillek's seen taste.
Lewis had plans to win Valtteri, but he didn't succeed.
Valtteri knows he needs to revitalize everything from himself to win Lewis.
And he was so charged that adrenaline pursed out of the ears, Wolff glowed.
Whether the talli Bottaksen and Hamilton's drive would be allowed to rehdistize, Wolff answered in answer.
We're talking tomorrow morning, and we're looking at how the kisa goes.
Kiteeläinen Erno Kinnunen achieved rally Finnish Championship
The rally car SM series ended rarely.
Hardly ever before have the brothers ended up championships in Finland at the same time.
Now it was done by Eerik and Henrik Pietarinen, who won the SM1 and Henrik SM2 classes, in a decision rally driven around Turun and Salon.
Kiteeläinen Erno Kinnunen secured his career's best achievement when the third-place decision-maker sealed him the Finnish Championship double-car SM4 class.
Kinnunen and cartoonist Ville Mäkelä, who competed in Honda Civici, started Turun's share contest with a model because the starting points were clear: positioning in the tip group would guarantee the SM title.
In Friday night's darkness, the two had to give adjustment when part of the extra light was cheating on another special.
It allowed you to enjoy the time as a shock for another third.
In such a situation, it doesn't fit on the horns.
On Saturday, only the pace of Jussi Tepon, who was in the second series, was followed, Kinnunen told.
Syria calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops
The Syrian Foreign Minister demands that the United States, France and Turkey withdraw their troops from Syria.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, Foreign Minister Walid Muallem says foreign forces must leave Syria immediately and without conditions.
Muallem said foreign troops were fighting terrorism in Syria, and war against terrorists was "almost over" according to him.
In his UN speech, Muallem also appealed to Syrian refugees that they would return to their home country.
But there is no end to the seven-year-old war.
More than 360,000 people have died in the war.
Chancellor Angela Merkel told Germany on Friday that October is planning a Syrian meeting involving the French, Russian and Turkish presidents.
Not quite Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the Supreme Court judge on TV
Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court judge, and Christine Blasey Ford, a professor accusing him of harassment, got an extraordinary amount of people in front of the screens.
The Supreme Court judge's drama of appointment in the U.S. attracted at least 20 million people to his TVs on Thursday.
At the time, Kavanaugh, appointed by Donald Trump, and Blasey Ford, professor of California accusing him of harassment, were in front of the Senate Judicial Committee to tell their stories.
According to preliminary results, the hearings were followed by six main channels: ABC, CBS, CNN, Fox News, MSNBC and NBC, a total of 20.4 million viewers.
In addition to them, the online consultation was followed by several millions more.
NBC announced that 6.8 million people followed live streaming and CNN reported that it had done its record for the year with 8.2 million broadcasts launched.
CNN's chapter will rise to more than 10 million when calculated via Youtube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital also achieved 8.0 million launches.
The digital launches are channels' own, the TV watchdogs come from the research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen publishes the final readings on Monday, but they're humiliating anyway.
Few yields to 20 million
More than 20 million viewer clubs in the U.S. are usually only accessible to sports matches, as well as the big Oscar and Grammy games in the entertainment world, as well as random political events such as presidential speeches and 2016 presidential election. you.
There's certainly a journey to the U.S. 's annual most visited programme, the NFL finale of the American Football League to the Super Bowl.
This year, the Super Bowl collected about 103 million people on the NBC channel.
Last year, Trump's first speech to Congress, according to Nielsen, a total of approximately 48 million people and officials fairly 30 million people.
Top-notch thing
Supreme Court judgeship is an extremely significant case in the U.S., as the posts are lifelong.
Trump already managed to appoint one new judge when Anton's Scalia disappeared from the beginning of 2016 and the Republicans managed to prevent then President Barack Obama from appointing him a successor.
Another place opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced his retirement this year.
Kennedy was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, but on several issues he was so-called vaa'an language, whose voice may have resolved the nine-court position.
She was a supporter of abortion rights and sexual minority rights, and in 2015, for example, she decided, by her voice, that same-sex married couples acquired marriage right throughout the federal state.
Kavanaugh is far more conservative than his positions.
His election to the Supreme Court may lock up the right for decades of conservative power.
Children have the right to access their information to parents
Only parents of children under the age of 10 see their children's health data from the Kanta service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong and it's bizarre.
Originally, the Kanta service situation was, of course, even more worrying: parents couldn't even look at small health information or prescriptions.
The situation was temporarily corrected in autumn 2016 for the under 10-year-olds.
Since then, practices have been promised to be corrected, but remediation has gone amazingly long.
Now the correction is in perspective - in 2020.
Because the problem is clear, changing the billboard shouldn't have been more than passing through.
Since then, the understanding of the painting is about the button's pressure: now that the beard is held on, it's opened.
A child may, of course, display his information to his parents - if he has bank notes or an official identity card.
But how many 10-year-olds do you have?
The identity card is paid, and the 10-year-old doesn't even receive bank charges.
In practice, therefore, the sub-school's nelo-class data cannot be seen by anyone other than by asking them to be printed.
It's not about parents' rights, it's about children's rights.
It's extremely important for the child's care that parents can be involved.
Of course, the right of adolescents to privacy must be taken care of.
Even minors may have family situations where all things cannot be freely discussed.
Often they relate to sexual health, of which free care is a deeply significant human right.
In the United States, the FBI launched a breach of Kavanaugh's interference charges
According to U.S. medications, the FBI is investigating at least two women's harassment accusations.
Another of the women was consulted by the Senate's Justice Committee earlier this week.
Kavanaugh has disputed accusations of alleged sexual harassment during his studies.
U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to clear the accusations at the request of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
The clearing should not take a week longer.
According to the Washington Post, it's a criminal investigation into a cross-border investigation, and it doesn't necessarily become public.
Man threatened to kill police at police station in Kajaan
The Kiinniotettu rähinöitsijä continued to bottle even in the chambers.
Police say they put a man in a police statement to "calm down."
On Saturday's anti-Saturday night in Kajaan, the police faced a threat from the suspect's malice.
The official is informed of the case, which got its beginning when a fair 30-year-old man challenged a harsh dispute in the centre restaurant.
The man first regretted another customer inside the nutrition movement.
That was followed by the removal from the restaurant.
An outdoor killer attacked another man by crashing him into the ground.
When the third party sought in between, the man still killed him.
The Kolmoispahoispitely led to the invitation of the police.
The party grabbed the man and took Kajaan to the police station, police say.
The suspect continued to behave aggressively at the police station.
The man would meet another police on foot.
She threatened to kill and incriminate the police.
Police say they passed a man's police statement to "calm down."
The man is suspected of three aggravations and violent opposition from the official.
Aid organizations are preparing to start work in Indonesia's Sulawes - "Clean water is it most urgent"
UN children's organization Unicef and other international aid organisations are ready to help on the island of Sulawes in Indonesia, says Kirsi Haru, head of information for Unicef in Finland.
Local authorities are leading rescue efforts, but the need for further assistance is already evident at this stage.
UNICEF is active in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programmes in Indonesia.
Along with normal operation, UNICEF always has a full emergency response capability, Haru says.
The first task now is to find people out of ruins, both survivors and dead.
Rescue efforts are underway in the city of Palu in Sulawes, but the situation in the slightly northern part of Donggala is less obvious.
There are still places where connections do not work.
Assistance efforts are difficult because the roads are different too, says Haru.
Buildings are often lightweight in Sulawes, so the devastation caused by earthquakes and tsunamis is large.
Once the survivors have been found, they need shelter - for example, tents - and clean water.
Pure water is the most urgent in crisis situations.
Firstly, people are mostly able to offer water purification tablets, which Unicefillakin has in stock.
Water systems are being sought to repair as soon as possible, but in the event of an emergency, water is being carried first, for example, on the record.
In crisis situations, many children get rid of their parents.
Looking for family members and reunifying families is one part of UNICEF's mission.
Food aid is organised, among other things, by the World Food Programme (WFP), which serves as part of the UN.
In the early stages, funds collected earlier will be used for emergency aid.
Among others, however, Unicef has already launched a fundraising effort to help victims of Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami.
Billionaire Elon Musk quits Tesla as chairman of the government - $20 million fines twiite
Elon Musk, founder of companies that manufacture space rockets and electric cars, avoids fraud charges in agreement with the U.S. Securities Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk will quit his role as chairman of the Tesla board of electric car company and agree to fines of $20 million.
Musk dodges the task as part of a deal he concluded with the U.S. Securities Markets Authority.
By agreeing, Musk avoids fraudulent charges.
The U.S. Securities Commission sec threatened Musk with securities fraud because of his twites sent in August.
In those, Musk wrote that he was preparing an electric car company to pull Tesla away from the stock exchange, prompting the company's share price to rise rapidly.
According to the agreement, Musk will not be allowed to serve as chairman of the Tesla government for three years.
In addition, Tesla must appoint a new "independent member" to its government and take two "independent leaders" to its management team.
Teslan must also set up a committee to oversee Musk's communication.
Musk is allowed to continue as Tesla's CEO.
In addition to Musk's personal $20 million fine, Tesla will also have to pay 20 million equivalent fines to the Financial Controller.
Twites misled investors
According to the sec, Musk's twiits misled investors and Tesla's shareholders.
Musk claimed he would have secured funding to buy Tesla back from the stock exchange as a private stock company.
According to Miljardöör Twiittien, the company would have been bought off the stock exchange for $420 a share price.
Tesla's share price rose more than 10% a day after the Twites, but fell later.
According to the sec, Musk's claims had no basis.
According to the Guardian, he hadn't actually negotiated his claim of funding.
He also had no discussion of withdrawing from the stock exchange with any other management team or government of the company.
On Friday this week, the course fell by 14 per cent, when sec, the securities supervisor, announced a fraud charge.
The news agreement is expected to reinforce the company's course.
The last sentence is not a reason
Of course, the sentencing clocks don't work when the viisars don't move.
It's a technical viasta.
The tower of Helsinki's courthouse has stopped.
The Viisars show a twelve o'clock.
The situation is like a medieval horror movie: even as the church's crypt belonged to the manausta and the careers would call themselves.
That's obviously not how it is, but the clock has stopped due to a technical reason: it's gone broken.
It's been watched by a corrector, but someone has gone broken and it's expected a new part, Suntio Eveliina Jamsen tells.
At the same time, Jamsen confirms the fact already mentioned by Kirkko Helsing's Twitter account.
Because the account mentions that the last sentence is not the reason for the clock to stop.
Jamsen says the church's clocks don't sound because of the fault.
