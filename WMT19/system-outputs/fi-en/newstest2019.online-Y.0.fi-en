Emil Kouki led Hurricane home win at the opening - Savo Volley second win
Hurricane-Loimaa, who had been awarded the medals of the Men's Volleyball Championship League seven times in a row, started the season 2018-19 with a home win when Raison Loimu fell on Saturday 3-0.
Returned from Romania to Finland, Eemeli Kouki was the most powerful Hurricane with 22 points.
There were some tunes abroad, but they did not come true, and then came a call from Loimaa.
Pretty quickly we got things done,” Kouki said.
Tomi Rumpunen, who played like Kook, supported Kouki by 18 points.
The most effective of the guests was the national team chipper Samuli Kaislasalo, playing on a match basis with 17 points.
The victory in the opening game is always important.
Many of the players had experience from the other side, and it added extra to the game.
Our game is not finished yet, but the continuation of the medal line is obviously the goal,” Kouki said.
I think Savo Volley's most powerful
Miro Määttänen was the most powerful in Savo Volley by 18 points when the team knocked down the Ducks 3-0 in Vierema Vantaa Ducks.
Our game was volatile, especially in the attack head, but fortunately we managed to squeeze the win.
At least I didn't have any conscious different charging when I played against my former team,” Määttänen said.
Antti Siltala, who started his career in Vieremä Volleyball 3 series in 2000-01, scored 12 points.
Head coach Jukka Tuovinen was satisfied with many things.
The hall was small, so the atmosphere on the ceiling all the time.
I left a good feeling from home opening.
Miro was the king, Herring played a good game, Tuovinen said.
Siltala's previous season in the league was 2006-07, then he won silver at Pielaveden Sammo while Tuovinen was head coach at that time.
Thiago Maciel was the Ducks' most powerful by 14 points.
Mikkonen again star of Aca-Volley
Joni Mikkonen, who won the league scoreboard in 2012-13, has also started this season strongly.
The chopper scored 25 points when Aka Volley took his opening win of the season after knocking down Kokkola Tigers 3-2.
The season has started quite well.
Of course, today was a loss, because we were losing 17 to 21 in the fourth round.
We dug a batch win, and the fifth round came in at the same time,” Mikkonen said.
A few seasons ago, the most powerful Tigers, who were still in the finals, was the 28-point chopper Edvarts Buivids.
The countrymen Aleksandrs Kudrjashovs supported by 17 points.
There was almost no grip on the guy's chopper, Mikkonen said.
Finland ranked the world's number one in the comparison of human capital
Finland is the world leader in the ranking of human capital, says Lancet.
The study compared human capital development from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years, Finland was the number one in the statistics.
In 2016, the top five was almost the same as in 1990.
Previously, Finland followed Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Later, Holland ranked one higher, and instead of Canada, Taiwan was found on the list.
In 2016, Niger and South Sudan ranked the worst in comparison.
Human capital is measured by the level of education of the population, access to education, skills and health.
The World Bank has outlined that human capital is linked to economic growth.
Real Madrid Thibaut Courtois kept Atletico in check, local game ended scoreless
Real Madrid's goalkeeper, Thibaut Courtois, went to the championship, and the Madrid team's local game ended in a goal-free draw late Saturday in the Spanish football league.
Atletico from Madrid, Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were closest to the goal, but the Belgian watchman Courtois had time to stop.
Courtois played three seasons at Atletico when he was a Chelsea player.
In the beginning of the week, FIFA chose him as goalkeeper of the year.
In real, Gareth Bale scored the best goal, but his shot was past by the end of the opening half of the goal.
Bale left the switch after the break due to a leg injury.
According to ESPN, disappointed Real supporters shouted the name of the target cannon Cristiano Ronaldo, who moved to Juventus.
The United States is now under attack on the right to abortion - a powerful documentary explains why
The United States Senate is currently trying to determine whether Brett Kavanaugh, nominated by President Donald Trump, could be elected as one of the nine members of the Supreme Court.
In the Republican Party, many people hope that Kavanaugh's decisive vote will overturn the decision known as Roe versus Wade, which made abortion legal in the United States in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's documentary film Reversing Roe - United States and abortion rights shows how the current situation has come over the years.
As incredible as it may seem, the topic is also relevant in Finland.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (sin) has done publicity work against safe abortion and received varying degrees of support from the majority of the members of Parliament.
At the beginning of a powerful documentary, you will meet a gynecologist Colleen McNicholas, who has become the only abortion doctor in the state of Missouri due to blackmail.
An armed guard at the clinic says he's defending the freedom of religion in the United States.
The news footage reminds us of the deadly terrorist attacks committed to clinics.
Let's move on to a time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At that time, the Lutheran Church Consortium led women to reliable abortion doctors.
The reasoning of the interviewed pastor is good, but actually they are not even needed, a photograph of a woman who died of a self-abortion is enough.
There were about 5,000 deaths in the United States in the year.
The Republican Party, in particular, defended the legalisation of abortions.
Already in 1967, California, the Abortion Act was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan.
Later, it was Reagan, in his presidential campaign in 1980, who began to make a difference in religion with politics in order to overthrow voters.
Abortion was also revolved by his successor George Bush Senior.
And the same was done by Donald Trump.
At the heart of the matter, the documentary is looking for the basis for politicisation of the issue of abortion.
When religious organisations in favour of apartheid were denied tax exemption, they became politically active.
They chose abortion as a cane horse.
Religion has brought extraordinary nodes into politics.
When this is written, the United States is faced with a situation in which the President, who has bragged about his sexual harassment, has chosen Kavanaugh as a candidate for the Supreme Court, who is now accused of sexual harassment by several women.
Kavanaugh can have the power to decide on the rights of 164 million American women and girls.
Israeli army shot seven Palestinians, among them two children - on the border of major demonstrations
Almost 200 Palestinians have been killed in six months after Israel firing demonstrators in the border zone.
On Friday, the Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians in the Gaza border zone, says the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
Among the dead, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, there are two children: boys 12 and 14 years old.
According to the Ministry, 505 people have been wounded.
Of these, 89 were wounded by bullets.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened fire and made an air strike in the border zone as demonstrators threw stones and explosives at Israeli troops.
The army says they have begun to use force, that the demonstrators will not break up the border fence or run to the other side of it.
At least 191 Palestinians have died in the demonstrations in Gaza since March when the Palestinians started weekly demonstrations at the border.
According to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, there are 12 000 wounded.
The demonstrators demanded access for Palestinian families to the areas from which the Palestinians had to leave when the State of Israel was founded in 1948.
A Palestinian sniper has killed one Israeli soldier.
Explosives dropped by kites and helium balls from the Palestinian side have ignited forest areas and farmland in Israel.
Teemu Santa got a penalty kick - he couldn't shoot himself
Wigan's finer Chey Dunkley seemed to have knocked him down with a tackling from behind in the penalty zone.
Referee Gavin Ward let the game go on.
According to his interpretation, the tackling was pure.
Teemu Santa could not believe his eyes.
I think the situation has been bothering Referee Ward, who sentenced Norwich to a penalty kick at the 85th minute Santa was knocked down.
Ward showed me the penalty spot, and Mario Vrancic hit the 1-0 winning goal.
Santa has scored Norwich five goals in the championship league.
The previous one was born last Saturday against QPR in style with a pectoral muscle.
He tasted working again.
After losing the ball, he went on to the end.
He created paint situations and defended tirelessly.
Norwich was the fifth fight in two weeks.
The team will continue in the league Cup.
Behind it is a five-win streak.
The paedophiles help service filled immediately with reservations - around 40,000 people are interested in children in Finland
It is estimated that 2% of men and a small percentage of women experience at least some sexual interest in pre- age.
In Finland, this means about 40,000 people.
Until now, those who are sexually interested in children or young people have found it difficult to get help.
A joint SERIE project between the Criminal Service Support Foundation and Sexpo educates professionals to meet paedophiles as clients and helps people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was announced in the spring, an email rush began in Sexpo, which provides counselling and therapy, and appointments were booked very quickly,” Yle says.
However, these are promised to be released during the autumn.
Sexual preference for children causes many shame.
The majority of those who are considerate of paedophilic feelings have not realized their fantasies and thus did nothing criminal.
However, preference is usually a permanent feature.
Most of them hope to get rid of the thoughts that depress and depress them.
They also complicate normal life,” says Patricia Thesleff, a sexual therapist for Yle, who is a specialist in the project.
In my opinion, the work is valuable if even one child is spared from sexual violence,” Thesleff says.
The leaders of the Korean or the Congolese gynecologist?
US President Donald Trump as a Nobel Peace Prize winner - the idea may suddenly sound strange, but Trump is one of the biggest favorites in the award based on betting odds.
The background is Trump's role in persuasivating North Korea to commit itself to nuclear disarmament, at least in terms of speech.
The main favorites of the Nobel Prize for Peace are the President of South Korea Moon Jae-in and North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un, who have met three times this year and promised to seek a peace agreement between their countries.
There is considerable warming between the Koreans, because it was still cold last year.
Yet the rewarding of Kim, who has been threatening nuclear weapons for years and leading his country with an iron grip, would undoubtedly raise criticism.
The Nobel Prize winners will be announced from Monday, and on Friday it will be the Peace Prize that receives the most attention.
If the prize is not awarded to the Korean Peninsula diplomacy, the Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege will be one of the top candidates.
A respected gynecologist has treated thousands of women who have been victims of mass rapes in her hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has become the world's leading expert in her field.
With his work, Mukwege has drawn attention to sexual violence, which is a vexing by-product of many conflicts.
The UN Organisation for Refugees, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981, has also been considered a strong candidate.
The Nobel Committee has told us that there are 331 candidates this year for the prize.
The names of the candidates are not disclosed.
Trump himself wouldn't mind if he got the Nobel Prize.
In May, a journalist asked him in the White House whether he thought he deserved a peace prize.
Everyone thinks so, but personally I would never say it, Trump said with a smile.
I want to get this done.
The prize I want is a victory for the whole world, the President continued with reference to the negotiations on North Korea.
However, there are facts that make Trump Nobel Prize unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Prize Committee, which decides on the award, has often acknowledged the people and organisations representing liberal democracy and a multipolar world order - the kind of international cooperation that Trump has been seen against.
In the 21st century, three American politicians, all of whom were democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007 and Barack Obama in 2009.
So, rewarding Trump would require an ideological U-turn of the Nobel Committee.
Fire notice in tunnel: Motorists behaved like lemmings and drove in the wrong direction
The traffic chaos on Route One Lohja took place on 8 September.
The traffic in the tunnel area was cut off in the direction of Turku and Helsinki as a result of the announcement.
When it became clear that this was a system failure, the fire department tried to bring traffic back to normal.
However, it did not work very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Finnish Road Transport Centre said that it cannot be opened because there are drivers on the road in shock and they are driving as it happens,” firefire-fire-fire-fire-fire-fighting Pasi Kääriäinen told the BTI.
At that time, the motorway was even driven in the wrong direction after just a few minutes of waiting.
When the first starts to act against traffic rules, a few others often follow,” says Tapio Heiskanen, Head of Transport Safety Contact Tapio Heiskanen.
According to traffic rules, motorways and tunnels must not stop except for compelling reasons.
Traffic security recalls that, in exceptional circumstances, one cannot start risking traffic with hasty solutions.
Alert vehicles shall always provide as unhindered access as possible.
Driving in the opposite direction on the highway is especially prohibited, as well as making a u-turn, as well as cancelling.
The same prohibitions apply even in tunnels, where, moreover, it is always necessary to turn on the headlights.
Stopping for no compelling reason is also prohibited, as of course parking.
There have even been cases recently when a driver stopped in a tunnel to brush snow from his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for this activity,” Heiskanen says in the traffic security bulletin.
Ilves fans would have wanted to continue their party even though the ship was caught at the bottom of the lake.
Ilves fans transported by the inland boat M/S Tampere would have wanted to stay on board and continue their victory party, even though the ship had caught its bow on the bottom of the lake,” says Juho Sylä, who was the captain of the ship at the time of the incident.
M/S Tampere, travelling from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, drove off its route late on Saturday night and got stuck to the bottom of its bow in Vanajavesi in Akaya.
Nineteen passengers and five crew members on board were evacuated to the mainland at night.
Nobody got hurt in the haver.
Ilves fans would have wanted to continue their party on the ship until dawn, but of course it was more sensible to send them to the port by fire department and take the bus home,” Sirä said to the BTI.
The Ilves fans had been to Hämeenlinna to watch the game between Ilves and HPK, which ended in the 4-3 victory of Ilves.
According to the side, Saturday's downfall was due to the fact that the water level in Vanajavesi was about half a meter lower than normal.
Navigation was also hampered by the fact that the nearest fairway sign was covered with seagull leaving, which meant that its reflectors were not normally visible in the dark cold bridge.
No more mention of a collision
Hadi took place on the west side of the narrow Jumusensalmi shortly after the shipping route had crossed the bridge of the motorway between Tampere and Helsinki.
There was no greater drama in the case, according to Jörä, as the speed of the ship was very low at the time of the incident and no more significant collision was caused by hitting the bottom.
According to the side, catching the bottom has not caused leaks or depressions on the ship, and the ship's cruises continue normally.
The diver went on Saturday morning to check the condition of the ship before the ship started towing off the shallow.
For the sake of certainty, we will visit the shipyard to check that there was no damage,” says SYrjä.
Sirä believes that M/S Tampere's next cruise booked next weekend can be handled as agreed.
According to him, the cruise season of the ship will continue until the Fourth of July.
No use for ambulances
The rescue department got an alert on the incident Saturday night just after 1:30.
In Viiala harbour, ambulances were alerted to receive evacuated passengers, but there was no use for ambulances.
The fire master on duty Matti Willman told late at night that the evacuation conditions on the lake were difficult due to the darkness and the rather strong wind.
The rescue department of Pirkanmaa informed after half past three on the night of Sunday that all aboard had been evacuated and passengers had been transferred by bus to Tampere.
Built in 1957, the cruiser was restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
Trump's candidate for judges accused of harassment and drinking may not be a top position.
Brett Kavanaugh, who has been nominated as a judge of the US Supreme Court, may well remain unqualified, says Programme Director Mika Aaltola from the Institute for Foreign Policy.
So far, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and improper behavior during their studies.
According to Aalto, suspicions have put so much political pressure on the Republican Party that President Donald Trump may end up playing someone else in office.
It has occasionally occurred in the United States that a presidential candidate for Supreme Court Judge has raised a great deal of controversy.
In this case, the candidate for judges usually withdrew himself, says Aaltola.
This is how the President has been able to preserve his face.
The nomination would be raining to the Democrats.
The US Supreme Court is trying to be above politics, but at least in the case of Kavanaugh, the election of a new judge has become a politically sensitive process.
According to Aaltola, if Kavanaugh is appointed, the decision will probably fall into the Democratic Party in the forthcoming mid-term elections in Congress.
It would increase voting enthusiasm among young people and women who are more likely to vote for democrats.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge to the Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for the Republicans.
There is no opportunity to nominate for every presidency, as in the United States the Supreme Court judges are appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have retired at their own request at the age of about 70-80 years.
Some of the Republicans hesitated to nominate.
Supreme Court judges in the United States are usually subject to a background check,” Aaltola says.
Although Trump has only set a one-week deadline for further investigation by the FBI, according to Aaltola, it can bring out something relevant.
It might.
Rarely there is smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
According to Aalto, it is certain that Kavanaugh's suitability or inappropriateness for office will still be discussed vigorously before the Senate decides.
The Republicans have a majority of 51-49 votes in the Senate, but at least two female Republican senators are thought to be sceptical about Kavanaugh's appointment.
The most embarrassing thing would be if the nomination were taken to the vote and the Republicans were lost.
Woman identified Salisbury suspect as a military intelligence agent.
The Russian woman reported to the public broadcaster BBC that she identified a Russian man suspected of poisoning by Salisbury as an agent of the Russian military intelligence service.
On the basis of the photographs, the woman told us that it was Anatoly Tshepiga, a military intelligence officer working at GRU.
The Internet community Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia reported that they had previously revealed one of the men suspected of poisoning to be Tshepiga.
Earlier, they said they had found evidence that the current identities of men are undercover identities.
The BBC group traveled to the Far East near the Russian-Chinese border, where Tshepiga grew up.
A woman living in the village identified young Tshepigan from photos published by Bellingcat.
He identified the same man from British police photos showing a man who now calls himself Ruslan Boshirov.
Russian men are suspected of poisoning former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter with Novitshok neurotoxin in March.
The scripters survived.
Colonel Tshepiga has been awarded the Order of the Hero of Russia in 2014.
Russia is still denying the suspect GRU connection.
In an interview on Russian TV earlier in September, the men suspected of poisoning reported that they were tourists in Salisbury.
Elderly people as throwing bags in the health and social services reform
Now there is a vivid example of what Sipilä's Government's limitation on changing the health and social services reform means in practice.
The health and social services of my native municipality, Vaala, are provided by the municipal authority of Oulunarc. The former Regional Director of Attendo has been elected as Health Service Director in 2016.
The heads of the consortium are warning the council about the change restriction.
If health and social services expenditure rises now, the municipality's state aid will be cut in the future.
The municipal centre decision-makers were frightened, and most of them are ready for a major structural change in the care of the elderly, which would end the inpatient care of the hospital and a small unit for the people with memory disorders.
Home care would be increased, which means long distances in Vaala that elderly people living in remote villages are ripped off their roots next to the health centre for treatment at home.
Attendo relied on the municipality to pay its customers.
The Left of the Election did not swallow bad preparation, but organised a good public event with a large number of relatives, local nurses and also representatives from other parties.
On the slides of the preparation for health and social services, I presented how the municipality of Vaala currently takes care of elderly people at home in the whole of Northern Ostrobothnia.
There was also a neighbouring councillor Carina West.
The local newspaper did a big story about the event, and it again lifted the Oulu draftsmen on their hind legs.
The health and social services draftsmen do not write on any paper that Attendo has built a new care home in Vala, which is now waiting for vacant residents.
There are no other service providers.
The draftsmen only talk about the service voucher, but do not tell us what level of care it will receive or what kind of personnel structure Attendo will take care of the elderly until hospice care.
Without a nurse?
Namely, the places of the health center are terminated because there is no night call for a doctor.
Attendo will also resort to the doctors of the Vala Health Centre.
The example of the Valaala illustrates how central officials run councillors with incomplete information and the councilors are put back against the wall with a change limiter.
In this way, the central party empties the inhabitants of Vala, for who stays there unsafe to live voluntarily if there is a chance to move out.
Was there a single election sentence in downtown that the whole country is kept inhabited?
Turkish President Erdogan opened a Grand Mosque in Cologne
In the city of Cologne in Germany, thousands of people protested when the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan opened one of Europe's largest mosques.
Several hundred people had gathered on the banks of the River Rhine as early as this morning.
Erdogan you are not welcome, read on the protesters' signs, and the slogans condemned fascism.
Several demonstrations have been organised during Mr Erdogan's visit on Thursday, and security measures have been strict.
In Cologne, some 10 000 people were waiting in advance to protest the human rights situation in Turkey, among other things.
There were also supporters of Erdogan in the vicinity of the Grand Mosque.
However, the police had isolated a large area from the mosque's surroundings for security reasons.
In his opening speech, Erdogan praised that his visit to Germany had been successful and considered that it had strengthened relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdogan met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
Erdogan and Merkel vowed on Friday to rebuild relations with the countries that have deteriorated significantly since the Turkish coup attempt in 2016.
However, Mrs Merkel stressed that there was deep disagreement between the countries on human rights issues, among other things.
The review surrounds the visit
Both the Mayor of Cologne Henriette Reker and the Prime Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, Armin Laschet, withdrew their participation in the opening ceremony as criticism of Erdogan's visit was accelerated.
A 30-year-old student from Turkey, Cansu, reported that he came to a demonstration against Erdogan in Switzerland.
I want to be a voice for those who cannot go out on the streets in Turkey.
They have been arrested, killed and subjugated.
For Erdogan, anything that differs from his own thinking is terrorism.
At the last stage of Erdogan's trip to Germany in North Rhine-Westphalia, a significant part of the population is of Turkish origin.
In Slovakia, three charges of journalist murder
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
The prosecution announced on Friday that three people are being charged with the murder of Kuciak and her fiancée in February and other crimes.
Earlier this week, the police arrested eight people in the murder investigation, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak was found shot in February with his fiancée from his home in Bratislava.
He had been investigating the connections between politicians and the Italian mob.
Police have suspected the murders were related to Kuciak's investigation.
The case and Kuciaki's published article have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
There may be problems with the distribution of Karjalainen on Sunday in sparsely populated areas
Due to the fault of printing, Karjalainen on Sunday will also have to be mailed unaddressed.
This may be reflected in the distribution of the magazine in sparsely populated areas where distribution into collective boxes is required from external memory.
The situation was the same for Saturday's paper, and the problem may continue on Monday.
Posting put extra bouquets of leaves in the province.
Newspapers from the rest of Finland will only be mailed separately on Monday with stickers.
The distribution of these leaves is noticeably delayed.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
Journalist Arto Nyberg will be interviewing live today in his forthcoming discussion programme, for example Vesa Heilala.
Vesa is in the studio about her upcoming space journey, which she booked from Virgin Galactica back in 2010.
The price was EUR 151 000, which needed a bank loan to pay.
If the original plans had been correct, Vesa would have been in space a long time ago.
However, the date of departure has been postponed from year to year.
Now it seems that after an unlucky test flight that took place in 2014 and claimed death, things are fair.
If all goes well, commercial flights will start this year or at the latest next year.
Vesa's flight number is 300, which means that her journey is about a year from the first departure.
The flight lasts 2.5 hours and in a weightless state we are 5 minutes at an altitude of 100 kilometres, the Finnish astronaut tells about the future on his website.
At the same address, he also backgrounds his longing for space.
When I was a kid, I read a comic book called Space Journey, and I saw a Star Trek series on television.
The Star Wars have been seen, and that's the idea of it.
Why not?
Everyone has his own dreams.
Manchester City was a rude host
Manchester City continued its loss-free passage in the Premier League as it knocked down Brighton on Saturday in his home field with 2-0 goals.
The reigning champion team's sixth victory is guaranteed by scorers Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero.
Sterling was able to direct his fourth hit of the season at close range to an empty goal when Leroy Sané found him 30 minutes on the back of Brighton's goal.
Agüero raised his own paint balance to 5 when Sterling and Sterling sawed Brighton Defense into pieces in 65th game minute.
The Argentinian managed to place the 2-0 endpoints at the penalty spot easily.
Starting with six wins and one draws, City leads the Premier League with 19 points.
However, Liverpool, who played one less game, lurks only one point away.
On Saturday night, Liverpool meets Chelsea in his own seventh round match.
Youth clubs selected new decision-makers in Joensuu
The Finnish Youth Society selected new decision-makers for their next three-year term 2019-2021 at their meeting that ended on Sunday.
Anu Siponen from Ylä-Savo was elected Chairman and Petra Mäkeläinen from Häme as Vice-Chairman.
The Board of Governors elected 40 full members and 40 deputies, the Finnish Youth Society informs on Sunday.
The youth club meeting was held in Joensuu.
We want our cultural activities to be known for quality and safety.
The Youth Summit held in Joensuu makes three promises in its three-year action objectives: we keep the doors open to everyone, we organise equal activities regardless of their place of residence and background, and we support volunteering and people on their own growth pathways. The Finnish Youth Society explains in its newsletter.
Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Ratchka and surprised Ferrari: “Loses a very important driver”
In an interview with the Swiss newspaper Blick, the British Mercedes driver asked whether he believed that the release of Kimi Räikköen from Ferrari's services would help Hamilton for the rest of the season.
Hamilton leads Ferrari's second driver Sebastian Vettel at World Championship points by 40 points.
A little less than three weeks ago, Ferrari told us that Räikkönen will not continue in the garage next season and Räikkönen announced that he would move to Sauber.
Of course, Hamilton does not believe that Räikkönen would hit gloves on the counter.
I don't think Kimi will change in the remaining races.
He's an exceptional professional - a fantastic driver.
He will remain one of my favourite drivers, and I am convinced that Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
It doesn't make any sense to me.
Hamilton has previously told us that Räikkönen has been one of his role models.
I don't know if Kimi knows this, but when I was young and dreaming of Formula One, I played F1 on PlayStation all day.
I was always Kimi, which is pretty crazy, Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season continues on Sunday at the Russian Event.
Starting from pole position at 2:00 p.m., Valtteri Bottas from Mercedes.
Evening magazine follows the race from the moment to the moment.
The A-Youth Championship Championship championship in football became a complete farce: the opponent arrived with only 7 players
The top league of football boys ends on Saturday, when the final round of the season is played.
The starting points for the championship battle were clear: FC Lahti Academy is enough for almost one point against Vasa IFK.
In order to reverse the situation in the final round, Lilves, second in the championship battle, must win the PK-35 and hope that the Gulf will be defeated.
However, the Lahti championship was confirmed in practice even before the start whistle, as Vasa IFK had arrived in Lahti with only seven players.
If there had been one less Vaasans, the fight could not have started.
FC Lahti Academy won the match 16-0.
On the break, the Lahti led 7-0.
One of the reasons for the disappearance of Vaasans is that the team has played part of the A-youth SM-series (P20) and Group C for men.
Vasa IFK has played virtually the entire season against falling in Two.
In the closing round two on Saturday, Vasa IFK will be forced to win JBK in an away match and hope that Tampere United will lose its own away match against KUFU in Toivala, Siilinjärvi.

Good luck was involved, the announcement states.
Rescue Department said the road was wet from the rain.
A police patrol was at the scene of the accident.
Supo is waiting for new ways to inquire: Equipment purchases and recruitments already made, no information about planned operations abroad
According to Supo's Chief Antti Pelttari, provision has been made for the Intelligence Act by purchasing equipment and training personnel.
When intelligence laws enter into force, there would be a permanent increase of approximately EUR 10 million in the sup budget.
The premises of the Finnish Security Police (supon) located in Ratakati, Helsinki, are already preparing for the entry into force of the Intelligence Act.
Antti Pelttari, head of Supo, tells Lännen Media that equipment purchases have already been made for future intelligence powers.
Serena Williams is stark in a video of her singing topless, campaigning for awareness of breast cancer.
Serena Williams, the tennis superstar, is shining again.
Now she is campaigning to raise awareness of breast cancer by publishing a video in her Instagram account where she sings only with her hands in front of her breasts,” says AFP News Agency.
The song is the 1991 hit I Touch Myself by Australian The Divinyls.
In the video, Williams is supporting the Australian Breast Cancer Association.
“I recorded the Divinyls global hit to remind women of regular self-service [breast] checks,” Williams writes in his Instagram post.
And yes, this set me in the area of discomfort, but I wanted to do it, because the subject touches all women, regardless of skin color, all over the world.
Early detection is everything a and o - it makes a lot of lives.
The second author of The Divinyls is Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project, made in honor of Chrissy Amphlett.
“He died of breast cancer but gave us a hit songs to remind women to put their health first,” says Williams.
The video has now been watched 1.5 million times.
It was released early on Sunday morning.
In the video comments, Williams is praised for courage.
Williams dropped out of the Beijing Tennis Tennis Tournament earlier this week.
There's a fright behind the US Open Tennis Tennis Tournament three weeks ago.
Williams was overheated by the chief judge of the match, claiming, among other things, that men accept much more violent behaviour than female players.

In addition to traditional Chinese cuisine, the restaurant serves stunning scenery.
An exceptional restaurant has been opened in the Chinese province of Zhejiang.

Youtube comments are wondering where the bathroom in the restaurant is located.
Hiking to the restaurant requires good ground condition, and the location is told.
Korpela's alley ends today: This is how it all ends
All good things will end in time.
Today, this is what happens to the domestic country drama Korpela's alley run, which has been quite popular.
The third season has gone like hot rocks: last week, 722 000 Finns were premiered on television.
The top figures in themselves are no longer of any practical significance, as Heikki Luoma and Jukka Mäkinen are not going to be a continuation of the series.
In the final episode, Jaska and Mirkka's relationship will take another big leap forward, and I think Jaska's mother will be the first to guess what's coming.
Ange and Miisa are warm and romantic in the light of recent events, but Laiho appears once again.
Even the police are suspicious about a sly man.
But no one knows what happened to Laei in advance.
Anita, on the other hand, is going to hear some incredible news.
The last will of the remote will will be expressed, which will put a woman on the brink of tears.
A week after Sunday evenings continues with the latest episode Sorjonen.
Korpela's alley running today at TV1 at 9:05.
Is it worth going to work tomorrow with a little flu?
Here are the facts for and against
The flu season is high.
A lot of people decide whether to stay home or not.
However, it is worth considering whether it is worth contaminating others, because the disease can be contagious, even if its own symptoms are small.
Sometimes the symptoms of the flu strike suddenly, sometimes they creep.
In the latter option, you may already infect others, even if your own symptoms seem small, says Prevention publication.
So you think it's worth staying at home?
According to prevention, the flu is contagious even when the person himself does not have any symptoms.
The virus infects already a day before the symptoms begin, and then from five days to a week.
Children may infect the disease longer.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you should not be in school or at work.
You can return to work when the cough stops and there is no fever anymore, says Professor of Medicine Gregory Poland.
You should also avoid workouts.
Return to the gym too fast will slow your recovery.
In addition, remember to wash your hands, sneak in a handkerchief and throw the snot paper into the trash.
But sick to move, huh?
If you have to leave the house sick, consider using a protective mask.
The mask does not keep viruses in check, but keeps the user aware of the area of the head.
Then you can't put your fingers in your nose or mouth,” says Poland.
Also, sneezing is limited with a mask.
Then how can we avoid infection?
The best way is still to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
However, the latter is difficult to avoid.
For example, in the United States, the average person touches his eyes, nose or mouth every 15-30 seconds, Poland warns.
New Miss Finland repeats the mission tradition: “My husband is a hockey player”
The hockey player and the misses are often combined with each other.
This was also the case with Alina Voronkova, 23.
Alina Voronkova, a native of Pertunma, has received the Miss Finnish Crown of 2018.
Beauty now lives in Lahti, where she moved to when she was 15.
Alina's mother is Ingkerian and her father is Russian.
Father's Russification Voronkova was bullied at school.
My mother and Father moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was bullied because I was Russian.
In Pertunmaa, I had no friends at all,” Alina says at the semifinalists of the Miss Suomi competition.
After middle school, Alina decided to start clean and move to Lahti to go to high school.
Soon the beauty of the mistress found new friends, and everyday life began to roll as desired.
When you're 15, you think you're an adult, but when you think about it, I really wasn't.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner Joonas Hurri, familiar from the Pelicans ranks.
After a career in the Championship, hockey player has played abroad, including Sweden and China.
In 2009, he was on the Finnish team at the World Championships of 18 years old.
In the early days of dating, the couple lived in a distance relationship for almost a year, but later Alina was able to travel with her husband to the world.
If I could get into the winning trio and that would give me a career, I don't want to believe that it would have any effect on our relationship.
Even if we have to live separately, we have good confidence and the good thing about distance relationships is that the spark always keeps on,” Alina grinned in May.
Rejoicing in continuous growth, death on our tail
Almost everyone is concerned about the resiliency of the Earth.
Still, there's not much they want to give up.
Sustainable alternatives to sustained growth are sought, but even the theory of equity economy runs into major problems.
Over a few generations, the continued growth of the economy has brought ordinary people, especially in the northern hemisphere, a standard of living that could only be dreamed of.
However, the long overrun of the planet's carrying capacity and climate change make the foundations of this market economy destabilise in a menacing way.
Two men were stabbed on Sunday night in Kannelmäki at Sitratori at 4:00 in the morning.
A man born in 1986 was seriously injured by a stabbing and a second, born in 1968 less seriously.
The older men have already gotten out of the hospital.
Police have apprehended one person whose possible involvement in the stabbing is being investigated.
Police are also looking for another suspect involved in the incident.
The events are investigated as attempted manslaughter and aggravated assault.
IFK Mariehamn's important point - Inter's coach regretted the error
IFK Mariehamn's Simon Silverholt handicap goal against Inter brought the team an important point in the men's football league on Saturday.

Silvelholt made it through the right side and luckily lifted the ball over the goalkeeper Henrik Moisander.
With a guest draw, the Mariehamn people reached the difference to the Turku Pallosauria in the series.
An important goal and a valuable point, summarized Peter Lundberg, head coach of Mariehamn.
Lundberg noted that, however, the team did not catch up with the kind of battle he expected.
We made a lot of mistakes during the opening period, but luckily the Turku paint brought us more into the game.
According to John Allen, head coach of home team Inter, the game was under control, but scoring again brought pain.
One defensive flaw took us a full score, Allen was annoying.
Again, we were the best!

The club and the player have discussed the subject, and the NHL is investigating the case.
After the match, Sam Carchidi, a journalist from Philadelphia Inquirer, who follows Flyers closely, estimates that Lehterä is part of a group of six attackers, five of whom will be placed in the NHL team.
In the rehearsal match, Carchid said the Lehterä was excellent.
In the second round, Lehterä fought the puck for himself with outpower, pulled the defender and fed the target to the open position of Raffl, who was waiting for the goal.
For the second time, collaboration between the two scored a goal right at the end of the match.
Flyers will start the NHL season on October 4 with an away match against Las Vegas.
In Boston, defender Urho Vaakanainen is waiting for the team's coaching leadership to decide whether to join the NHL team.
I thought the training camp was good.
I did my best, and I can be proud of this.
Now the coaches decide if I can play.
I think I'm ready for the NHL, Libra said in an interview published on Boston's Twitter account.
Libra, who learnt his hockey lesson in the river boys, played against Philadelphia for 19.31 minutes.

A fresh picture shows a change: the world's strongest man lost tens of pounds
In 2017, crowned as the strongest man in the world, Eddie Hall undergoes a striking transformation.
The British Eddie Hall hunted for the title of the strongest man in the world for a long time and determination.
Hall could eat up to 10,000 kilocalories of food a day, and according to Mirror magazine, weighed 200 kilos.
Shirts were size 5XL.
Before winning the title, Hall admitted that he was doing damage to his body.
The human body is not created to be this size, Hall said.
The British hunted for the victory of the strongest man in the world at all costs, and a man with a family promised to end his career if he got the title.
Hall didn't want her kids to grow up without a father.
Hall kept his promise and was no longer seen at the 2018 World Strongest Man Games in April.
Recently, Hall released a picture on Instagram where she poses for her active career in a slimmer condition.
Hall writes that its current weight is 169.5 pounds.

The previous Finnish winner of the competition is Janne Virtanen, who was number one in 2000.
Restaurant ship M/S Tampere crashed agitatively in Pyhäjärvi - “Strongly attached to the rock”
The inland boat M/S Tampere drove aground late on Friday evening in Akaya in Pyhäjärvi.
The rescue department received an alert about a water traffic accident Friday night after 1:30.
The 30-metre ship M/S Tampere has landed on the rocks and is firmly attached to its bow on the rocks, described fire master Matti Willman.
The ship was carrying 19 passengers and five crew members.
According to the Rescue Department, personal injury was avoided.
Passengers and almost all crew members have been evacuated to the mainland.
Now they are being transferred by bus to Tampere,” said Head on call Jari Nieminen to the BTI after 1:00 in the morning.
In Viiala harbour, ambulances were alerted to receive evacuated passengers.
The ship travelling from Hämeenlinna to Tampere had for some reason driven off its route to the west of the narrow Jumusensalmi.
The police are investiging the cause of what happened.
The fire master on duty Matti Willman told earlier in the evening that conditions on the lake are difficult because of the darkness and the rather strong wind.
Rescue Department says the fate of the ship is unclear.
Apparently, the ship's not leaking.
After the evacuation operation, divers will begin to check the situation at the bottom.
Built in 1957, M/S Tampere is currently an inland waterway vessel operating as a restaurant ship with a maximum number of 180 passengers.
There is also a meeting room for private use.
According to the ship's website, the cruiser has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.

Ex-managers demand unpaid fees from Robert Helenius
Boxer Robert Helenius' night's fight against Erkan Teper is overshadowed by a money dispute.
Ilta-Sanomat is today reporting a summons application submitted by boxing manager Jaakko Helmisen and Vice Judge Jussi Kokkila, in which Helenius is charged with overdue manager fees worth over 80 000 euros.
According to the summons application, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helenius from 15 April 2014 to 30 January 2015.
We've tried to reconcile, but we have no choice.
There has been a clear mandate here, and a great deal of work has been done,” says Kokkila to Ilta-Sanomi.
Helenius's current manager, Markus Sundman, sent a response to Iltalehen, which explains the boxer's vision.
Helenius denies being obliged to pay the required amount.
According to the response, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services in an economically difficult situation to Helenius and promised to be able to provide him with matches and sponsorship income.
Verbally, it was agreed that Helenius is obliged to pay commissions only percentages of his matches.
Repeatedly it was assured that Helenius does not have to pay anything, just receive the income organized by them.
This is also the normal and only practice in the management of professional athletes.
Payment work has never been agreed, and such would have been absurd in Helenius' situation, Sundman explains in his message.
There was never a written agreement on cooperation.
According to the response, Helenius would have wanted to agree on the distribution of income in writing from the beginning, but Kokkila and Sundman did not get the draft until the end of 2014.
He said the proposal was poor and cut off cooperation with Kokkila and Helmet.
Helenius never fought once when he was in contact with Kokkila and Helmet.
One year after the end of the cooperation, Helenius had been assigned an “unidentified but extensive” invoice from the manager's work.
This year, the same claims have been filed.
Helenius considers Helmet and Kokkila's after-life activities to be cowardly, says in the response.
Today, Helenius faces Erkan Teper in Stuttgart, the seventh member of the IBF heavyweight challenger list.
A heartfelt man and a good journalist
Entertainer and music producer Ilkka “Ile” Vainio knew the late radio presenter and journalist Erkki Pälli for decades.
The long-line radio host and journalist Erkki Pälli died of incurable liver cancer at the age of 83.
The presenter's obituary was published in Helsingin Sanomat on Sunday.
The announcement says Pälli died on September 3.
Pälli told about a serious illness on his Facebook page in March 2018.
The publication was also seen by Ile Vainio, who was sad about the fate of the acquaintance.
He has already said farewell on Facebook, says Ile Vainio.
Vainio considers Erkki Pälli as a multi-talent expert who became an excellent journalist.
He remembers that Pälli was a loved person with fast thinking and funny stuff.
I got to know Erk when I was a little boy when I first visited Finnplate when I was 12 and started there as a warehouse man.
Erk and I met each other back then.
At the time, he was a spokesman for Finnevy and in various positions,” Ile Vainio recalls.
As I started working as a music producer, there were hundreds of events where Erkki Pälli was a regular editor at all parties doing stories about artists.
He was always knowledgeable and I could see what a great fire he had for entertainment, music and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got directly into the skin of his interviewees.
He was a hearty man and a good journalist.
Many people knew him as a respected Yle radio host, but he also wrote great newspaper articles.
Erkki interviewed me several times.
He was good at talking, Vainio says.
Over the decades, Pälli worked as a journalist in the Fazer label with Toivo Kärje.
He worked as a music producer on Vesa-Matti Loir records.
However, Pälli's greatest passion was radio work, where he had an original style.
He was working on radio since the 1960s, and he became familiar with many listeners in Yle's ether.
Pälli retired in 1998.
The Finnish Ski Association announced on Saturday that the Finnish Ski Association's financial year ended in May showed a profit of approximately 450,000 euros.
The Association describes the “U-turn” of its economic situation, although the economy is, of course, burdened by “a significant debt on the balance sheet”.
Executive Director Mika Kulmala praise for quick response and strict financial discipline.
We reacted to the situation as quickly as possible last autumn, taking adjustment measures.
Careful planning of operations and financial management has rested throughout our organisation,” Kulmala says in a press release.
We have also succeeded well in partner procurement, and in addition, the world cup yield was maximal in the past competitive season.
However, in the future, the management of costs must be precise and, at the same time, we must constantly look for new financing models.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
Dozens of bodies lie in the backyard of the hospital in the town of Pau on Sulawes, Indonesia.
Only one building separates them from the area where injured survivors have been gathered to assess injuries and the need for treatment.
Patients are also being treated outdoors for aftershocks.
One of the people in the hospital area was Baharuddin, 52-year-old Return, looking for his son.
Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
I have one child, and he's missing.
The last time I spoke to him was when he was going to school, Baharuddin told the AFP news agency.
In the yard of the military hospital in Palau lay Dwi Haris, who has suffered injuries to his back and arm.
When the earthquake started, he was in a local hotel with his wife and daughter.
The family had been invited to the Reentry wedding party.
I was probably pinched under a collapsed wall.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him and my kid.
I hope they are safe, told Haris News Agency AP according to British media.
Small shops are looting
At the Palau evacuation center, the mother of a 35-year-old little baby Risa Kusuma tried to calm her feverish baby.
He described the moods in the city as tense.
Clean water is scarce.
Small shops are looting everywhere,” Kusuma said.
Many residents of Palau have slept outdoors or in temporary bamboo houses.
Even if the house is somehow standing, possible aftershocks could destroy it once and for all and bury the inhabitants.
According to the news agency AP, more than half of the prisoners in Palau prison escaped after the prison walls collapsed.
There are reportedly about 560 prisoners, which means that there are probably about 300 fugitives.
Some of the prisoners in Donggala prison have also escaped, says The Jakarta Post.
According to the newspaper, prisoners were furious and set the prison on fire after the guards told them not to go in search of their relatives affected by the earthquake and tsunami.
Palau airport has been reopened mainly for relief flights.
One of the first to land a military C-130 transport aircraft, which brought relief supplies.
Commercial flights to Palau airport are only permitted to a limited extent.
The pilots are forced to land on the ground without the help of air traffic control, as the control tower was severely damaged in the earthquake.
The rain sweeps over Finland at night
On the night of Sunday, a long rain area spreads across the country, says the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
Rain comes mostly as water, but in Central and Northern Lapland, sleet or snow is expected.
The frosts of the previous night are not repetitive, because under the cloud cover temperatures remain higher.
The cloudier night keeps the lowest temperatures pretty effectively under control.
In the west we can temporarily visit the frost side, said meteorologist Ville Ilkka.
On Sunday, the rain area will give way to the east during the morning.
In the south and west it is sunny or semi-cloudy.
In the afternoon, temperatures move up to Oulu altitude in steps of 10-13 degrees.
The starting week looks similar in terms of temperatures in the southern and central regions of the country, but the weather becomes more unstable.
Wind and surfing warnings are in force in marine areas.
There are no actual autumn storms to be expected for the next few days, but otherwise there is a typical variation of weather in autumn.
The autumn is really starting to hit it, Ilkka said.

Other members of the jury are Jutta Gustafsberg, wellbeing entrepreneur, photographer Nadi Hammouda, CEO of Jouni Store Mint Murphy-Kaulanen, and news producer Katja Lintunen from Seiska.
We were hoping he could get to college before he went to the pageant.
Russian father Dimitri and mother Svetlana from Ingrian believed in her daughter's success in the Miss Suomi finals.
The parents of the recent Miss Suomen Alina Voronkova Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkova proudly followed their daughter's first moments of crown head.
They rushed to the audience from Pertunma and planned to drive back home after the finals.
There is a wonderful mood!
We believed in Erika all the time, but half an hour before the result, Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana is Ingerian and Dimitri is Russian.
Alina speaks fluent Russian, although she has lived in Finland all her childhood.
Svetlana says that Alina was more interested in acting as a child than in her career.
Alina was often told that when she was so pretty, you should start being a miss.
But he said he wanted to be a radio host.
It was only later that Alina got excited about beauty contests.
The parents' wish was that Alina would enter the university before participating in the Miss Finland competition.
That's what happened, and eventually Alina still wanted to get her bachelor's degree before the pageant.
We already asked him why he didn't attend, but he wanted to finish his own.
Parents believe that Alina won the competition because it is a wholesome example for young people and adults.
He does sports a lot and eats healthy.
And Alina likes to be on display, it shows.
Alina's boyfriend Joonas Hurri plays hockey for a living in Japan and couldn't get to Finland to encourage her love in the finals.
Alina's parents believe that the relationship between young people lasts a year of patronage.
Yes, it is meant to be!
Parents hoped that the daughter would be able to come by soon.
It's been such a long break in visits because of the pageant busy.
I miss you already, even though I've been sending messages.

Sari Piippo left his career in Brussels and became a housewife in Finland - an idea came to mind: lack of drawing skills did not slow down
Organuuhömppä started from my husband's phrase in which he suggested it in a story I developed as a person, says comic book blogger, housewife and former EU translator Sari Piippo.
Sari Piippo says that he was an EU translator for economic and legal matters in Brussels until after the fourth child the family became a returnee ten years ago.
I've been so happy as a housewife.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point I thought, “What do you do when you grow up, when even the smallest child started to be big? “
Then in 2014 a cartoon came into the picture.
Piippo says that he had never dreamed of making a comic book, even though he had read Donald Duck, Tintin and Asterix since he was little.
The last time I drew was when I was a kid, but when these scripts from the Organic Bomb started to emerge, the situation changed.
At the beginning, I did some dozens of scripts in the drawer.
My daughter Vieli Vakama (b. 2000) is a skilled artist, but I couldn't get her to join me until the summer of 2016 when I bribed her with a drawing board.
His enthusiasm lasted for a dozen stripes, and then I had to start trying, laughs Piippo, who says that the drawing board was a great incentive for him.
A drawing board is an easy and convenient tool for trying to get something done.
On paper I did not even try to draw, says Piippo about his relationship with drawing, which he usually does in the evenings.
Scripts pop in all the time, but usually I don't finish at once.
One three-screen strip takes up to several hours.
I might make a screen at a time, and I'd love to play with colors.
It's always the hardest thing to start drawing, because drawing is not my strongest kind.
Sari Piippo says he appreciates Scott Adams' dilbert for his current comics from newspapers.
The personalities of the organic dummy are the L-theme mother with a carrot body and salad hair.
The other persons are Man, Pissis and Gemini.
In the world of organic stuff, man is what he eats.
The ideas of the series come from their own life and social media.
Sari Piippo doesn't want to preach or offer a must-have bottle, even if the Organic Bomb sometimes gets into it.
Peippo tells me he's reading his show with his husband and his children.
It's such a great feeling when you look at the comic you've drawn and say that this is what I've done today.
And there are plenty of challenges for the housewife!

Indonesian earthquake: the air traffic controller sacrificed himself, didn't leave a cracking tower until he got hundreds of passengers safe.
The hero of the earthquake in Indonesia has been the 21-year-old air traffic controller Anthonius Gunawan Agung.
Agung was left alone in the control tower until he was able to safely get a passenger plane carrying hundreds of people off an island shaken by an earthquake.
The young man was in charge of air traffic control at Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport in the city of Palu when an earthquake struck Friday.
While others escaped from the control tower, Agung refused to leave his seat before he could steer the airplane of Batik Air from the runway.
In this way he could save hundreds of lives, the Indonesian Aviation Administration told AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport on Saturday after the earthquake.
The control tower was shaking and cracking.
Eventually, Agung tried to save himself by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
He broke his leg and suffered severe internal injuries.
Agung was rushed to a nearby hospital.
He was to be transported to a better equipped facility by helicopter, but he died 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, the representative of the FAA told The Jakarta Post.
The earthquake continued to intensify when the flight got into the air, and its strength was finally measured at 7.5 magnitudes.
At least 832 people lost their lives.
The Indonesian Aviation Administration has respected Agung's heroism on social media.
Rehn considered Yle Europe ending up in a trade war: “Must watch the next tweet”
The trade war between the United States and China is reflected in the global economy as a whole.
Throughout Europe, growth forecasts have been calculated and the Bank of Finland has also slightly lowered its own economic growth projections.
President Olli Rehn said in Yle's number one statement that, although tightening tensions do not have a direct impact on European trade flows, it undermines confidence, which in turn is reflected in business investment decisions.
The situation also applies to the export of Finnish companies.
Mr Rehn believes that Europe is very much at its forthe moment.
It has been able to build peace with the United States and has also helped to calm the situation with China and Japan.
In the opinion of Mr Rehn, Europe does not seem to be grummaging at the foot of a trade war.
I have to look at the next tweet and evaluate it afterwards.
We have a pretty unforeseen partner in Washington direction, however, he said in an interview with Yle.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of them is Italy, the third largest economy in the euro area, which is also one of the most indebted countries in the euro area and in the western world as a whole.
The market reacted drastically yesterday to the clearly deficit budget presented by the Italian Government on Thursday evening.
Next year's deficit will be over 2.4% of domestic product.
Mr Rehn is concerned about the situation in Italy.
5% of the country's loan portfolio is problematic loans, and unorganised loans account for over 10%.
In addition, its public finances are weak and the country seems to again exceed its commitment to its European partners.
Perhaps it is not worthwhile to paint new crises, 'Mr Rehn said when he was asked whether Italy would bring Europe into a new economic crisis.
Another issue that affects Europe is Britain's resignation from the EU.
Rehn hoped it would be okay.
A disputed separation would have a much more negative effect.
Rehn started as President of the Bank of Finland in July.
Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank (ECB), will withdraw from office in just over a year.
The conversation with his successor has begun.
The name of Rehn and his predecessor Erkki Liikanen has flashed in speeches.
I don't mind if Finnish names are included, Rehn said and added that he will not comment further.
HS's super popular Black Box performances continue again next week - the last tickets to Helsinki are on sale
The popular Black Box performances organised by Helsingin Sanomat will continue again in the beginning of the week.
Other performances will be held at the National Theatre on 2, 8 and 11 October.
23 October The Black Box is visiting the Tampere Theatre for the first time.
There are still some tickets for the National Theatre on sale.
Tampere performance is sold out.
Tickets sell Lippu.fi.
During the evening, reporters and photographers will tell a long-prepared true story that has never been published in any HS medium.
Once again, there's something that no one has ever heard.
“There is a strange spy in Helsinki night, an impressive reportage from the other side of the globe and a talkin story about a very topical health issue,” says Esa Lilja, one of the producers of the Black Box.
After the performance, the audience will have the opportunity to meet with HS reporters and photographers and continue the conversation.
Helsingin Sanomat has organized live journalism evenings for three years.
They have been popular from the outset and often sold out.
Over 15,000 people have been in the stands.
The Black Box was awarded at the Bonnier Gala as a journalist act of the year.
The awards thanked the new way of doing journalism and the desire of journalists to come close to their readers.
Spring 2019 Black Box will be seen at the National Theatre in March and April.
The performance will also visit Tampere and Turku.
The presentation that will be seen at that time has a different content than the evening this autumn.
The lost mushroom picker was found thanks to “open-minded experiment”
Finnish police drone expertise is top in the world: “We are asked for training”
According to the Rector of the Police University of Applied Sciences, the police can use drone in addition to searching for missing persons, for example in crime scene investigations and intelligence tasks.
On Tuesday, the Oulu police managed to find a mushroom picker missing in Raahe with the help of a drone in just a few minutes.
Kimmo Himberg, Rector of the Police University of Applied Sciences, tweet about the incident, mentioning, among other things, that “through open-minded experimentation and effective training, we are at the top of the world here too”.
Drone is quite a new thing and even newer in police duties.
Nowhere is there any statistics that the Finnish police are the master of drone use.
According to Himberg, there is a strong impression that this is the case.
This has been evident, for example, when Finnish police experience has been reported in international events.
There is an awful lot of interest in it elsewhere,” Himberg says.
It would be hard for visitors to watch the drone action by the Finnish police.
They're asking us for training.
More and more common
Himberg points out that finding a missing person in winter conditions in Finland as soon as possible is very important.
As has been said, in Raahe's case, the lost person was found with the help of a drone in just a few minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
According to Himberg, they are meant to be trained more.
Already today, drone is widely used in police operations, and their use will become more frequent and more frequent in the future.
That is what I dare say, Himberg says.
In addition to searching for missing persons, Himberg says that the police can use drones for example during accident or crime scene investigations and for certain types of intelligence.
For example, we have to go and check a certain area a little further, where there may be fears of violence.
Drone can then be used for pre-inquiry.
Karelian Rugby went to Division 1
Karelian Rugby celebrated the victory of Division 2 in Kuopio on Saturday.
The Joensuujoki people were still in the middle of the match 7-12 down to Helsinki Rugby Club, but in the second period they found a plot and porched the guests from the south 26-12.
At the same time, the 2nd Division championship meant Karelian Rugby a historic rise to Division 1.
In the past, the club has played first, but at that time the Finnish Rugby series was divided into two levels, the SM-series and several sections 1 division.
The club is about to accept the comic position, but it's gonna be a lot of work for next winter.
The current roster of less than twenty players has to be raised to 25.
Division 1 also knows the increase in the number of games and longer journeys, so fundraising must also be in line with this.
Kotkaniemi starts the season in Montreal, confirms Head Coach
Claude Julien, head coach of Montreal Canadiens, a hockey player in the NHL, confirmed in the club's Twitter account that Finnish attacker Jesperi Kotkaniemi is starting the season in Montreal.
Montreal booked a super promise Kotkaniemi, 18, in the first round with number three in the summer booking ceremony.
The attacker joined the Montreal training force at the end of the summer and has presented strong touches in the September rehearsal matches.
Kotkaniemi immediately managed to score a goal in his first practice match.
Head coach Julien praised that the Finnish had taken big steps since he arrived at the newcomer camp.
The NHL regular season begins on the night of Thursday next week, Finnish time.
Montreal will meet Toronto Maple Leafs in the opening round.
What is a good leader?
Much has been said in Finland this week about management.
Risto Siilasmaa, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Nokia, told HS about his book Paranoid Optimist, in which he shed light on his philosophy of leadership.
At the same time, he criticises the leadership of his predecessor Jorma Ollila.
Ollila categorically denied the accusations, but even earlier Nokia reports have talked about the inability of managers to act as a team; fear and non-speaking, which partly caused the collapse of the mobile phone business.
The company's ability to take risks and agility in the upward phase disappeared.
The Nordic Business Forum also took place in Helsinki during the week, which brought the cream of Finnish business life to the Exhibition Centre.
In addition to the main star Barack Obama, there were 12 stars in the business world.
There was enough talk about good leadership.
Legend of management doctrine Gary Hamel said that a good leader must have the courage to take the company into the future even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that the decisions are made by those who are most mentally linked to the decisions of the past.
John Mackey, the founder of Whole Foods, known for its wide range of organic products, said that a manager should be able to communicate to all the staff the purpose of the company.
And that purpose can't be just making a profit for the owners.
Susan Cain, the author of the Success Book Introverts, said that the most successful leaders are, according to research, humble.
They act calmly, quietly and purposefully.
Often they are introverts.
Professor of Finance Awath Damodaran recalled that the qualities of a good manager must coincide with the phase of the company's life cycle.
At the beginning of the company, the manager must be able to tell the story on which the future of the company is based.
A company that has grown into a mature phase needs a manager who knows the numbers.
The Nordic Business Forum listened to 7,500 visitors - mostly Finnish leaders.
They were in danger of an information supply.
It takes a lot of money for a good leader.
That's why management is so often wrong, even at the highest level.
Siilasmaa and Ollila were also present.
They talked to each other in the scenes in a comrade.
However, they hardly wonder whether they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And their humiliation was not easy for an outsider to judge.
Sara Chafak arrived in a gorgeous red carpet straight from Los Angeles - spends most of her year overseas
Model Sara Chafak arrived at the mission finals in a gorgeous black dress.
The 2012 Miss Finland's spectacular dress also had a lace trap.
A little bit of jet lag.
I came back from Los Angeles again.
I spend most of my time there, Chafak tells me what's going on.
Chafak tells me he's going to LA for auditions.
Among other things, he's been doing advertising descriptions.
He describes his work in the United States as interesting, and also similar to that in Finland.
However, according to her, work needs to be done even harder, as there is always a replacement for the work of the model.
You have to push harder and be aggressive, says Chafak.
Choreographer Sonya Lindfors receives 30,000 euros live art award in Kuopio
Artist Sonya Lindfors won a cultural award worth 30,000 euros in Kuopio on Saturday.
Lindfors, awarded the Anti Festival International Prize for Live Art, works with choreography, community activism and teaching.
The art of Sonya Lindfors is vital to its immediate surroundings.
His work allows others to work and create spaces for dialogue in environments where they were previously lacking, the jury described the winner.
In addition to the Finnish Lindfors, there were a number of international artists nominated for the award.
The award is awarded annually to an exceptionally strong artist or group operating in the field of live art.
The Danish police found a Volvo wanted in a large operation: “We can't tell where”
The extensive search by the Danish police has produced results.
At the beginning of the operation, traffic was closed on the Oresund and Great Belt bridges.
All land and ferry services from the island of Själland were closed to Sweden, Germany and the rest of Denmark.
Police were looking for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
IS has reached the shift chief of the media center of the Copenhagen Police.
We've found the car we've been looking for.
We cannot yet tell you where the car was found, Henrik Storm from the Copenhagen police report tells Ilta-Sanomi.
According to Storm, the wanted black Volvo has no direct connection to the threat.
According to him, the greatest danger is over.
The Danish Ekstra Bladet told us about the police briefing on Saturday.
Investigative Director Jørgen Bergen Skov was very discreet about the operation.
He didn't want to tell me what kind of crime code they're investigating.
However, Skov told us that this is a “serious crime”.
It was a threat to people's lives.
We've been looking for three people in this operation.
The police won't tell me if they've already been captured.
According to the newspaper, the restrictions on ferry traffic have been lifted.
The Copenhagen police also followed the events on their Twitter account.
According to the BTI, however, according to the police, there is no longer cause for concern for the general public, as the threat was targeted at certain people.
The name of Macedonia has been causing discord for decades - now the people will vote in disputed elections
In Macedonia in the Balkans, the proposal for a new name is currently being voted on.
Under the agreement between the Macedonian and Greek Governments, the name of the Republic of North Macedonia would be the Republic of North Macedonia.
Greece has so far blocked Macedonia's attempts to become a member of NATO and the EU by its veto.
According to Greece, the name Macedonia belongs to its northern province.
The question of the referendum does not mention a new name, but asks whether the electorate is in favour of Macedonia's membership of the EU and NATO by accepting the agreement.
The vote started leisurely at least at the school in the centre of Skopje.
Olivera Argirosvka, a retired nurse who voted at the school, hoped for support for the agreement.
A referendum will mean a change if it opens the doors to Europe and NATO.
It means a change especially for young people, he said.
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which became independent in 1991, has been referred to as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev's government has campaigned for the agreement to be approved.
The nationalist right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has called for a boycott of the referendum.
In addition to the result, there is plenty of tension to see if the turnout rises above the required 50%.
The referendum is not binding, but a 'yes' vote would give the mandate to change the Constitution.
A two-thirds majority of Parliament is required to change the Constitution.
The agreement has yet to be approved by the Greek Parliament.
The polling stations close at 8:00 p.m., Finnish time.
A handsome victory!
Robert Helenius knocked out Erka Teper
Robert Helenius met Erkan Teper in a heavyweight professional boxing match in Germany late Saturday night.
A 34-year-old Finn took a stand against his 36-year-old German opponent in Waldenbuch, located next to Stuttgart.
Tonight's main match was the IBF heavyweight Intercontinental title match.
The winner may be able to get to the fight in tougher positions that are of considerable economic importance on Saturday.
Helenius solved the match in the eighth round, when he knocked out Teper with his hard left hand punch.
Teper couldn't get up from the floor anymore.
“Nordic Nightmare” was hurting his opponent in the third round, when the German began to bleed from his nose.
Helenius and Teper met in the ring for the first time.
They were supposed to fight as early as December 2015.
That's when Teper pleaded the injury and withdrew from the fight.
After that, it turned out that the German had been bred twice on the doping test.
Helenius has taken 28 matches of his professional career in his name and suffered two losses.
As a clear favourite, Teper has won 19 professional matches in his career and lost three times.
Hamilton team order to win - difference from Vettel already 50 points
The Formula One championship title was approaching once again, as Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes won the Russian gp and stretched his World Championship lead to Sebastian Vettel in Ferrari to 50 points (306-256).
There are only five races left.
Valtteri Bottas, who left the race from the pole position, took second place.
Last year in Sochi, Bottas, who took the opening of his career in Sochi, held the top spot near the middle of the race, but Mercedes told Botta to let Hamilton pass.
Vettel drove third, Kimi Räikkönen from Ferrari.
The Max Verstappen of Red Bull, which started from the last starting row, was the fifth.
The two assaulted a Jewish man in Joensuu. They were caught a block away.
Two men assaulted and kicked a 31-year-old Jewish man in Joensuu at Silltakatu 12 on Saturday after 6pm.
Police say the men also stole the victim's phone, among other things.
Police reached the suspects, a 35-year-old man with a hay water and a 39-year-old man in Ilomantsia a block away shortly after the incident.
They were caught on suspicion of robbery, the police say.
The victim suffered bruises that didn't require a doctor's visit.
Elon Musk, CEO of the electric car company Tesla, will leave his post as Chairman of the Board of Directors.
Musk has made an agreement with the US authorities.
At the same time, Musk has been fined $20 million for his tweets that he would have secured funding to withdraw Tesla from the stock exchange.
The US Securities Commission, the SEC, has accused Musk of securities fraud.
Musk will continue to be CEO of Tesla, but the company will also have to pay a fine of EUR 20 million if the agreement between the authorities and Musk is confirmed in court.
Canada is fighting time to reach an agreement between Nafta and the United States.
Time threatens to run out in the middle of the negotiations between the United States and Canada on the free trade agreement on Nafta.
The United States has set a deadline for Sunday, and their negotiators have discussed closely throughout the weekend.
Canada's chief negotiator, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, postponed his speech at the UN General Assembly in order to concentrate fully on trade negotiations.
At the request of President Donald Trump, the United States, Canada and Mexico started negotiations about a year ago to reform the North American Free Trade Agreement.
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached an agreement, but agreement with Canada has not yet been reached.
The United States and Mexico want to enter into force before Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who won the presidential election in Mexico, takes office at the beginning of December.
Trump has said that Canada's involvement in the agreement is not necessary.
He has previously informed Congress that it is planned to sign a contract at the end of November, whether Canada is involved or not.
In view of these timetables, the text of the agreement between the United States and Canada should be ready on Sunday in order to give the US Congress sufficient time to assess it.

Police captured 11 people after the Honka-HJK match - brawl in the field and in the subway station
The police apprehended eleven people after the Honka-HJK match in the men's football league played in Espoo on Saturday, and Teemu Värtinen confirmed to the BTI.
The reason for the arrest was to protect against crime and disturbance.
The apprehended were released after the situation had calmed down,” Värtinen said.
The apprehension was reported earlier by the Evening Sanomat.
The match ended at 0-0.
After the final whistle, a large number of viewers rushed into the field from the stands reserved for HJK fans.
The situation led to pushing and fist fights between the supporters of the teams.
In order to put an end to the situation, Mounted police were needed, among other things.
In addition to the field, there was a lot of brawl in the neighbouring subway station, where some of the arrests took place.
I was not there, but what I saw in the pictures was an unpleasant situation, Värtinen referred to the brawl in the field.
According to Värtinen, no criminal reports have been filed as a result of the events.
Tablestone flushed the butterfly swim to its SE time in the World Cup, Laukkanen also swam to the finals
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Tektikivi have reached the finals on the final day of the 3/7 swimming World Cup competitions in Holland.
The races will swim in Eindhoven on a short track.
HSS Teskkivi overtook Finland's record in a 50-metre butterfly swim where he was second in the early stages at 22.82.
Earlier in September, Teskkivi swam in Helsinki during the trip SE period 22.77.
Ari-Pekka Liukkonen, representing Cetu, Espoo, was 24th during the butterfly swim period 24.68.

Students play a rare delicacy: the ancient tragedy - the reduced Oresteia affects its visual
Ancient tragedies are a rare treat on Finnish stage.
The National Theatre, for example, has last seen an ancient tragedy, Sophocles Filoktetes, in 1988.
Now the Theatre Academy has brought the Orethia of Aeschhylos to the tour starting at the National Theatre.
Started in 2015, pallets open! projects The actors of the Theatre Academy work together with a professional director internationally.
This fourth project, like the first one, is directed by Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
The international premiere Oresteia was awarded in Berlin in April.
The Arrangement of Orethia summarises the story of the end of the vendors of the Atreus family and the creation of the rule of law in an hour to twenty minutes, especially by tightening the chorus sections.
The work succeeds in being very loyal to the spirit of Kirsti Simonsuu's fine translation (2003).
The dramatic lights and the presentation revealing the sides of the theatre space highlight the simple and bright stage thinking.
It focuses on the dynamics between the chorus performers who perform title roles, and the choir.
The presentation uses both double and triple interpretations of title roles.
The actors do not leave the stage at all, so, for example, the murders of Agamemnon, who returns from the Trojan War and his spoils, Kassandra, will also be shown on stage, contrary to the tradition of ancient performance.
Of course, the performance does not emphasise that it is faithful to the tradition of antiquity.
Rather, a modern, faithful interpretation of the text is created before the eyes of the viewer, which is constantly aware of its ritual roots.
Roiha has succeeded in bringing out a rhythmic group of actresses from the Master's degree students as a close group, even a single organism.
Especially in choir sections, actors who are flexible to very expressive, sculptural group formations have access to their rights on a bare stage, only decorated with a white curtain.
Impressive.
The Oresteia Performance Tour continues to Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.
The Korean manufacturer produces its first hydrogen loader
The novelty is beginning to appear in Europe, especially thanks to the cooperation agreement concluded with Hyindi and the Swiss company H2 Energy.
According to a cooperation agreement published at the IAA Commercial Vehicle Show in Hannover, Hyundai will deliver a thousand car batches of new models to the Swiss company and its partners.
By launching the fuel cell truck Hyundai continues along the road marked by Nexo and IX35/Tucson Fuel Cell models as a hydrogen car manufacturer.
With this first project in the world, we are taking fuel cell technology even further.
We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market for these vehicles, for example by following the development of the refueling network,” Hyundai Motor's Vice President In Cheol Lee said at the announcement of the contract.
The fists were floating on several occasions in Kajaaan
A man in his 30s assaulted three men in a restaurant in the centre of Kajaani and in front of it on Saturday morning hours.
The man first hit one man inside the restaurant, and as a result he was removed from the scene.
Outside, he pushed another man into the ground, and in the absence of a third man, the assault hit him too.
The police apprehended the assault.
At the police station, the man still behaved aggressively and kicked another cop in the leg.
He also threatened the police with assault and killing.
A man was taken to jail to calm down.
The case is investigated in three forms of assault and violent opposition to an official.
In the centre of Kajaani, there was also another assault incident on Saturday at night.
The victim was assaulted by two men.
First, a Kayan man, about 20 years old, hit the victim.
A little later, another man knocked him down and the man who beat him still kicked him.
Outsiders pulled the assaults away from the victim, and the police called.
However, the perpetrators already left before the police arrived.
The police will ask the witnesses of the event to contact the Kajaani Police by phone 0295 416 520 or by e-mail at tutkinta.kainuu@poliisi.fi.
Long line radio host Erkki Pälli is dead
Erkki Pälli, known as Yle's long-term journalist, died of cancer at the age of 83.
Radio host Erkki Pälli, 83, is dead.
He died of incurable liver cancer, which was reported on his Facebook page in March 2018.
Yeah, this is all right.
The doctor has said it, I live day by day, he commented on his situation to IltaMagazine a month ago.
The safety of the aunts and uncles of the store must be guaranteed.
The first time I got paid for a newspaper article in 1984.
With these annual tires, when you're amazed by a subject of a story, it's usually big news.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27 September) about the insecurity of retail workers, I was amazed and sometimes even a little angry.
I also spoke to the case with Erika Kähärkäräääääääääääääää.
He says crime statistics don't tell us the real situation.
The problem is growing, although employers, of course, claim otherwise.
The police are only aware of cases that are clearly considered serious and many real violent situations remain unreported.
“Companies are obliged to record their near-misses according to the Occupational Safety Act, but these statistics remain internal and their data are not collected anywhere,” he said.
Mental injuries do not end up in the statistics.
Violence situations have always been the problem that they do not always lead to physical injuries.
Despite this, mental traumas can be much more serious than bruises and wounds.
The distinction between a situation of violence and a threatening situation of violence is difficult to draw when a certain level of aggressive threats must be counted as violence - even if there is no harassment.
Too many people are afraid in the workplace, even if the actual action does not happen.
Some neighborhoods are restless.
The store has acquired guards.
When the opening hours of the stores were released, the media had a pretty big impact on the safety of sellers.
“At that time, quite a lot of employers organised guard services for at least night-time hours and to prevent working alone,” Kähärä commented.
When nothing happens, we draw the wrong conclusion.
This now seems to have had an effective effect, but this produces a new negative trend.
When, as a result of security, disruptions remained well under control, the impression was created that security would be unnecessary.
Now there are many places trying to find solutions that could eliminate expensive security services.
Mild assault is a plaintiff offence, and it is quite understandable that an abused seller does not want to file a request for inquiry into a criminal who usually lives near the store.
But according to the same paragraph of the law established in 2011, a slight assault becomes subordinate to the prosecutor if it occurs in the workplace.
I think we need precedents now.
The next time an aunt or uncle in the store is being assaulted, the police should investigate and the prosecution should be prosecuted.
When the court put a few assailants in jail, and a sentence from there on the hard end of the penalty scale, the manners would be cleaned up.
A society in which the grocery store has to be open almost day and night in small towns must guarantee the safety of its employees.
Heidi Sohlberg signed for the miss before the start of the live broadcast - “Sara, Iiro is then married”
The crowning of the Missi will not be seen in the traditional way on TV this year, but will be shown by the Viafree website.
The broadcast is hosted by former Miss Suomi Heidi Sohlberg and Iiro Harjula, host of NHL and KHL studios at Viasat and Viaplay.
Backstage and the red carpet are hosted by Janni Hussi.
Prior to the live broadcast, the host trio informed the invitations and media representatives who arrived at the scene of the broadcast.
At first, Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harjula a big round of applause.
Now all the women scream!
Look at this man's host, Sohlberg glowed his colleagues in the crowd cheering.
The front row of the races is followed by many Miss Finland of previous years.
Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi sat next to each other and Sohlberg made a small joke in one direction.
Sara, Iiro is married!
Sohlberg cut off looking at Saros.
Most likely, Sohlberg referred with his throw to the newly divorced Siepp, who laughed at a comment, even though he seemed confused at first.
The Snatcher spoke of his resignation for the first time in the Evening Sanomat Weekend.
Miss Beauty told me she didn't want to open up the reasons for the divorce in more detail in public, because that's between her and Scrooge Salminen.
He said he's not in a hurry to get into a new relationship. He's going to focus on himself.
I focus on my own things and especially start living my own life alone,” Sara Sieppi said.
Harjula's marriage situation became apparent even later when Sohlberg mistakenly mistakenly called Janni Hussi and Iiro Harjula as a couple.
The host trio laughed at the screw-up.
I thought Iiro was married, or how did it go?
Janni Hussi signed for the mistake.
The Ostrobothman tortured his tied cohabiting partner by cutting, burning and feeding concentrated sauce
The district court of Ostrobothnia has sentenced a 34-year-old man who lived in Kokkola for a number of crimes committed against his cohabiting partner to three years in prison.
The offenses were, among other things, belt, cable and cable ties.
These items were confiscated by the court.
The harshest charge was on a suspect in felony rape.
However, this charge was dismissed by the district court.
The Kokkola was accused of four assaults, aggravated assault, coercion, illegal threat, deprivation of liberty, and two acts of damage.
The offences took place between 26 March and 24 May last.
At the end of the last deeds, the man was captured and imprisoned a few days later.
On Thursday of the previous week, the district court of Ostrobothnia issued its judgment and ordered the 34-year-old to be kept in Vaasa prison.
There's no evidence of a rape.
A 34-year-old was also accused of two gross deprivation of liberty and of gross rape on 22 May.
However, these charges were dismissed by the court as undeniable.
The case was held in court behind closed doors.
However, the district judge issued a public statement on the verdict.
According to the district judge, the defendant had subjected his spouse to violence, threats and coercion in situations where he had been tied up.
The defendant cut his victim with a knife, smoked cigarettes, fed strong sauce and poured water and coffee on top of him.
In its judgment, the court ordered the State to confiscate criminal equipment: a belt and cable, a tie, a bathrobe belt, a knife and a water gun.
Four witnesses.
According to the district court, the parties continued to live together between the acts.
It can be seen from the conviction that a large part of the most outrageous acts occurred at the end of the crime period.
In court, four witnesses, two women and two men were heard.
A 34-year-old victim must pay a total of EUR 5800 for pain, pain, suffering and temporary harm.
I don't think he has that money, because the convicted person already has debts in his old days.
It's not a man's first sentence to imprisonment.
The tabloid doesn't give the convicted person's name to protect the victim's privacy.
A recent district court court is not legally enforceable at the time of writing.
Europe four points lead to the Ryder Cup
On Saturday, European golf professionals imprisoned their leadership in the traditional punch match against the United States.
Europe leads the Ryder Cup on the outskirts of Paris with a score of 10 to 6, while the twelve singles on Sunday are still ahead.
Europe won three of the four four-ball matches that started on Saturday, and the afternoon doubles equated to 2-2.
Europe's leading stars were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four matches they played during Friday and Saturday.
In the past, no European couple had been able to reach such a thing.
On Sunday, the two are pursuing more history.
No European player has won five points in one Ryder Cup, and even Americans have only three players: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK condemns the violent harassment of its supporters in the Honka match: “Violence is not part of football”
The football betting league team HJK released a bulletin on Sunday condemning the disorderly behaviour of its supporters in the Saturday FC Honka match in Tapiola.
“We apologise for the events following the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our supporters,” says in the press release.
At the end of the match, about 50 HJK fans rushed into the field and some seemed to be trying to pick a fight with Hong's supporters.
There was also a fight between the supporters.
The police were not able to calm the situation down. They needed police officers and also the Mounted Police.
HJK says in a press release that the team's players and staff are shocked by what has happened.
The events after the match are not in line with the values of our traditional 111-year-old club.
“We strongly dissociate ourselves from any activity that jeopardises the safety of match events,” says in the press release.
The HJC promises to assist the authorities and event organisers in identifying threats to safety and eliminating milesies.
A supporter culture is part of football and an important issue for HJK.
We fully support positive, joyful and supportive action in football stands.
“Violence is not part of that,” says in the press release.
Filipino inventor flies with a drone car - this will avoid traffic jams
Mendiola is a Filipino inventor, hip-hop dancer and some kind of Pelle Fearless.
He's now part of a group growing around the world who swear to have invented a flying car, or at least his own version of it.
As competitors, he has such factors as Audi and Airbus.
However, Mendiola does not believe in mass production of its equipment.
According to reports from the world, a man has spent much of his fortune building his dream.
Six years ago, he started developing his flying car.
Now he calls the development version a drone car.
Recently, he says he made the first successful test flight - he floated with his device at an altitude of over seven meters.
One of his goals was to avoid traffic jams.
I hope that the device will provoke positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago, Mendiola said, according to the British Daily Mail.
JHL predicts: The industrial action that begins tomorrow will be reflected in children's day care and social and health services
In public and welfare sectors, the ban on overtime and shift exchanges will be particularly evident in social and health services and children's day care, says Päivi Niemi-Laine, Chair of JHL.
The effects will be extensive and will certainly be visible in such a way that there is not enough staff on the ground.
Everyone has to wonder how to pick up their children.
It is now up to the employer to ensure that services play and that no one's life is threatened, Niemi-Laine says to the BTI.
According to Niemi-Laine, the scarcity of employees was also evident at the beginning of the year when JHL members were banned from overtime and shift changes due to contract negotiations.
Employers have made it possible, through flexibility, for staff not to be recruited, but to stay overtime or change shifts.
This is not an industrial action yet.
From the point of view of occupational safety and health, it is quite normal for every worker to take care of regular working hours and only to do them.
The JHL acts against the Government's intention to reduce redundancy protection for small businesses.
Markku Jalonen, Director of Social Services for Municipal Employers, will not start to assess the impact of overtime and shift bans.
However, he does not believe that they are very revolutionary, although services may deteriorate.
Employers from all over Finland are aware of this and have made the preparations for what can be done.
The area is so vast, the social and health sector and the technical sector that it is difficult to say.
The effects can vary very much by industry, region and employer,” Jalonen said to the BTI.
Jalonen says that last week we already had experience with similar activities of Superi, the Association of Local and Basic Nursing and Social and Health Care (Tech), for example, which lasted three days.
Their effects were rather limited.
JHL's ban on overtime and shift changes applies, among other things, to employees of municipalities, church, state and private social and health care sectors.
For example, family day nurses are excluded.
At this stage, almost 100,000 JHL members are affected.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL's actions may take a long time.
The Federation is also prepared for other industrial action if the preparation of the Dismissal Act continues.
The government should now admit that we're running to the wall and fast.
Progems believe that both the union movement and the government must meet.
It is peculiar that the hard ones are already in the barrel, although the performance has not yet been given,” Jalonen updates.
The Great Coral Reef is created by children and adults - in the fitness circles of the performance, the gestures of the ray and seahorse are studied.
The Great Coral Reef of the Opposite College premiered last spring in Hamburg and last Saturday it was performed for the second time in Finland, this time in Kanneltalo.
Like the previous works of the group, the Great Coral Reef is a work that is built from the beginning to the end together with the audience.
This time, however, a clearer presentation is being built, which refreshes and summarises the observations made during the initial exercises.
In theatre play there is plenty of fairy-tale magic for children.
The child's perspective has been included already in the preparatory phase of the work.
However, the Great Coral Reef is not a children's performance, but a performance that adults and children make together.
It gives adults information and observations on how children receive information and make art.
The ability of children to throw themselves into practice and joint games also increases the distance between adults and children.
The Great Coral Reef is somewhat reminiscent of fairy-tale ballet, fitness circle and nature awareness, but once and for all it is tuned around visits in different, non-human conditions.
The Great Coral Reef begins with acquaintance with the trajectories of corals and species living on the coral reef.
In six different fitness circles you will learn, among other things, the gestures of the ray ray and seahorse.
Finally, a performance of less than an hour will be performed, where music, lights and shiny paints and costumes will help you explore the life of the coral reef.
In the Great Coral Reef there are both diving people who observe the life of the coral reef and the corals that are being looked at.
In addition, there are organisms looking at corals.
The eyes and observations shown in many directions make the performance dense and live-full.
Whether it's a landscape of some organism, a species that looks at the landscape, another organism or landscape looking at the organism - and all this at the same time.
For children, it does not seem difficult.
In Other Spaces, the group aims to reach the boundary of thinking and action, which is challenging when the group consists of both children and adults.
On the other hand, the presence of children makes it more significant.
After the workshop, a quiet demonstration will be held in Sitratori for endangered corals.
Damages beyond human understanding must not be allowed to be hardened, although it might be difficult to understand the importance of exercising one's own compassion in the face of the prospects of destruction.
In other spaces, the works have been built in such a way that it respects the diversity of life also by means of a political gesture.
There are other generations, there are different kinds of consciousness, other species and their future generations, for whose wonder and play it makes room for.
Children grow up too quickly - I'm happy that in my childhood there were no smartphones
Today's children and young people are becoming more irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking at a younger and younger age.
In my opinion, children should be children throughout their childhood, not messing up their lives for substance abuse and sex, because other people say they do.
I was ashamed when my friend told me that he had had to pick up his fifth grade sister over the weekend from his “boyfriend”.
When she came to pick up her drunk sister, she told me about her sexual experiences that night.
There is no way I could imagine my own sister in the same situation, because we've been told and warned throughout our childhood that drugs should not be touched and sex is an adult thing.
I wish today's children would be able to live a decent childhood, and they would not have to grow up too early because of the group pressure created by friends.
I keep seeing girls getting younger and younger in Instagram who are in their pictures with makeup on their faces and expose their clothes on.
Snapchat is used to capture and send revealing images in the evening.
It is even more difficult for girls to guess at what age they are.
Today's 13 years old can easily look like 18 years old and older.
My childhood consisted of playing in the woods and playing board games.
I'm happy that in my childhood there were no smartphones.
I got to be a kid for many years, and I didn't have to think about what other people think of me.
Yle: Authorities told the government that the Airiston Helmi case had no connection with national security
According to Ilkka Kanerva, interviewed by Yle, the Finnish Security Service and the Finnish Defence Forces visited the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees earlier this week.
The Finnish Government has been informed that the Airiston Helme investigation is currently not related to national security, but to organised crime,” Yle News says.
The information from anonymous sources was confirmed by Ilkka Kanerva, Chairman of the Defence Committee for Yle (Ilkka Kanerva).
According to Kanerva, the Finnish Defence Forces and the Finnish Defence Police visited the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees this week to report an ongoing investigation.
This is primarily considered financial crime.
They were quite strict about not speculating that this would be different,” Kanerva commented in an interview with Yle.
According to Yle's information, there has been no evidence of any connection with national security in the seized material, but the investigation is just beginning.
There is no way to know what might come out of there,” says one of Yle's interviewees.
A week ago, extensive searches of homes started in the Turku archipelago and on the mainland have raised the question of whether the investigation is simply a financial crime or a threat to Finland's internal security.
Earlier this week, the evening newspaper compiled a story about allegations for and against.
Video: Dream Goal saved Liverpool's Loss-Liverpool series
Liverpool's 100% Premier League start was completed, but it was still more satisfied with a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge.
Sunday is exactly one year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and ran away for a 1-0 guest win.
That's when the Pep Guardiola combination sent a signal to the entire Premier League that City was serious now.
Everyone remembers how last season ended.
And surely Liverpool's manager Jûrgen Klopp arrived in West London with the same idea.
The Red had started the Premier League with six consecutive victories.
Liverpool started stronger and Virgil van Dijk in particular seemed to dominate alone with his own field head.
Chelsea, on the other hand, was underneath Wednesday's fancy league win at Anfield Road.
That's when Eden Hazard stood up from the bench to solve the match with a great individual performance.
Now, of course, Hazard was with us from the very first few minutes.
In the 25th minute, he first played ball in a small space with Mateo Kovac and Jorginho.
Finally, the Croatian saw Hazard plunge forward and sent him a perfectly weighted pass.
Hazard drifted a little to the edge of the penalty zone, but bombed the perfect left leg pull into the rear lower corner.
The pool brass watchman Alisson was a little slow in his rebate and only got his finger on the ball.
Klopp must have felt the defeat position lightly unfair, because almost immediately after Antonio Rüdiger cleaned Mo Salah's control from the finish line.
In the second episode, Chelsea Vescher Kepa got into action.
The Basque Guard reacted quickly to Sadio Mané's bet and pushed the ball from the base of the pole to the corner kick.
At the other end, Alisson, with his throwing himself down Hazard's drive.
The best place for the guests came in 72 minutes when James Milner found Bobby Firmino with his focus.
However, Brassitstar's butt was directed towards the national team mate David Luiz, who saved the hosts' leadership.
Even that couldn't last the 89th minutes, when the replacement man Daniel Sturridge was free to shoot at 25 meters.
Sturridge played on his old home stadium, and the attacker bombed an irresistible bet on the top corner.
Liverpool's 100% league start was completed with a 1-1 draw, but it's still in the league top together with Manchester City.
Chelsea is also firmly involved in the championship battle with two points behind the tip.
In the clock transfer conversation, the holes are deep
I remember when a few decades ago a newspaper asked different Finnish influencers what divides the Finnish people.
Juice Leskinen's answer was the only one left in his mind: the NEN-ending.
Some people have a nos-ending in their surname and some do not.
I mean, you could have split lines anywhere, and there was one bidder here.
Finland has made it possible for the EU to give up annual clock shifting.
Very many people agree that moving clocks twice a year has been a job for fools and has caused a variety of problems.
In the end, at least in Finland, this achievement seems to be the easiest stage of the solution, although it has not been easy.
The most difficult thing now is to decide what time of day you will end up with: the current summer or winter time or some other time zone.
This also allows people to express their opinion on otakantaa.com page.
The survey was opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and is open until Friday 12 October.
There is a fierce debate on coffee tables and social media, and everyone has a say.
The defenders of winter time justify their position by the influence of morning light on people's well-being, and summer time is defended by the influence of evening light on people's desire to go out and thus on their well-being.
Both positions have strong supporters and good arguments.
According to research, morning light rhythms a person's day and gives vivage.
On the other hand, if you do not particularly suffer from waking up in the dark, the illumination increases the movement of people outdoors and gives better opportunities, for example, to work in the yard in the autumn.
The amount of additional light after a normal working day is already calculated for his hour.
I'd prefer to take both, but, unfortunately, there's nothing we can do about our position in the north of the planet.
Winters are too dark and summers are too bright for many anyway.
A typical feature of the debate on the subject is that one's own vision is driven and another's view is very strongly opposed.
You don't listen to the arguments of the opposing party, because the most important thing is how you feel.
Since almost everyone has an opinion on this, it is somewhat pointless to try to turn the other's head.
It's a waste of gunpowder.
The subject is terribly easy to debate, because it does not require much attention and it is enough to have a minty feeling to justify it.
Such matters are usually the most controversial and equally fruitless.
Well, I'm sorry if the wrong option is chosen, but I think we can adapt to that too.
And it always provides a suitable scapegoat if life feels sad.
Josba fought for a close away victory
Josba's first away game at the gym Diver scored a full three series points against Nurmon Jymy.
Josba left Seinäjoki on his way home with a joyful 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory.
Nurmo was still running paint at the beginning of the third round, but Josba was looking for compositions and recycling men in chains.
In time 50.47 brothers Eetu and Juuso Lehtiniemi plotted a 6-5 winning goal.
As both teams were retarded, decisive minutes were played in the flat.
Josba's most effective was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2 + 1).
Kakhitju was firepower anyway when Teemu Tuhkanen (1 + 1), Jere Kaartinen (1 + 0) and Jere Kettunen (1 + 0) also hit.
Miika Kosonen (1 + 0) played her goal at the time of birth.
Josba, after three rounds of the league, has six points.
The next item will be O2-Jyväskylä with guests in two weeks.
Uncle's church on Sunday 200th anniversary party
The 200th anniversary of Eno's church will be celebrated tomorrow Sunday in a very sad mood.
The arson of the Church of Acceleration a week ago was a shock.
Uncle's church was guarded the two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, today is still the place of celebration.
Even if no one would like it, Eno Church is now the oldest church in the Joensuu Parish Association.
The church on a hill in the middle of the village has always been the heart of Eno, despite all the local and other connections in the world.
The family show starts at Eno's church at 10:00 this morning.
After that, we move to the parish house to the Karelian banquet table.
There's a lot of things on the program all day, both inside and out.
For example, you can visit the church building with the guidance of Ari Räsäen who has been retired for 37 years.
The celebration of the birth of the church also means the end of one era.
Already decommissioned, the parish house built in 1982 will keep its doors open today for the last time.
Now we are in a dodging space in the former town hall,” says Chaplain Markku Koistinen.
The parish house was destroyed by indoor air problems, but the church has been standing in a healthy place for 200 years.
Elon Musk gives up the position of President of the Tesla Board of Directors - Fraud charges were settled at $40 million
The electric car manufacturer Tesla and the company's CEO Elon Musk have settled their lawsuits with the SEC.
The SEC suspected Musk was guilty of securities fraud, and Musk was in danger of being put aside by the company he founded.
However, Musk will continue to be CEO of Tesla.
Instead, Musk has to give way to Tesla's Board Chairman for three years.
The company will have to hire an external chairman of the board.
Musk is also subject to stricter surveillance.
According to the agreement, Tesla will have to employ two independent directors and monitor Musk's communications more closely.
In addition, Tesla and Musk will each pay USD 20 million (approximately EUR 17 million) to settle the case.
“The decision is intended to prevent further market disturbances and harm to Tesla's shareholders,” says Director Steven Peikin of the SEC.
The incident started in August when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might pull the company off the stock market.
Musk also wrote that the company's funding is secure.
Tweet momentarily increased the share price of Tesla.
The SEC suspected Musk was guilty of securities fraud.
According to the agency, the tweet was false and misleading, and Musk had not talked about the arrangement with other management or potential financiers of the company.
In practice, the agency accused Musk of misleading investors.
The SEC announced on Friday that they're suing the company and Musk.
The SEC said that he was demanding that Musk be fined and banned from running the listed companies anymore.
The SEC challenge frightened investors, and Tesla's share went down sharply.
Over 800 people died from the earthquake and tsunam in Indonesia
The number of deaths from the earthquake in Indonesia and the tsunami that followed has risen to at least 832, says the AFP News Agency.
The number of fatalities is expected to increase, as the damage is ongoing.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kallas, the final figure could reach thousands.
Friday's earthquake raised the tsunami, which hit the town of Pali on the island of Sulawes.
A warning was issued about the tsunai immediately after the earthquake, but it was quickly canceled.
According to the authorities, almost all known deaths are from Palau, at least so far.
The rescue authorities are concerned, among other things, about the area of Donggala near the centre of the quake, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Already many people are known to have died.
Requests for help from the ruins
The Indonesian army has been alerted to assist rescue workers in the search for victims.
President Ji Widodon, who arrived in the area today, urged the soldiers to continue their rescue work without exhaustion day and night.
One of the focus of the rescue work is the hotel in Palau, where 50 to 60 people are still believed to be in the ruins.
Muhammad Syaugi, head of the Rescue Agency, said that one person could be excavated alive from the ruins of the Roa-Roa Hotel, a popular business traveler.
We also heard people's requests for help, he said.
According to Syaug, heavy grubbing-up equipment would quickly be needed for the earthquake and tSunamis area.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their missing loved ones.
Help me, you in Palau and nearby.
My friend's family members are still missing, one author appealed to the Facebook group.
Politicians' phone numbers leaked into the hands of troublemakers in Britain
Many British politicians were harassed when their contact information was leaked due to deficiencies in the encryption of the application.
The troublemakers had access to ministers' phone numbers, among other things.
It was an application used by the British Conservative Party Assembly in the Government.
For example, Michael Gove, the Brexit Minister for the Environment, Food and Rural Development, and former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, were harassed.
Several MPs received harassment calls.
Due to the lack of encryption in the app, the audience had access to the profiles of politicians that were in the mobile app of the Conservative Party Annual Meeting.
The audience had access to profiles using a politician's email address, which was easily accessible online.
The user who logged in to the profile was able to view and edit the material stored in the profile.
Someone managed to change Boris Johnson's profile picture for a while to turn it into an abuding porn and title.
The profile image of Michael Goven was changed to the image of the media mogul Rupert Murdoch.
The Guardian columnist Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that the meeting app allows you to log in to other people's profiles using their email addresses.
Then the sign-in can view the contact details of the profile person and, for example, send messages in his name.
The conference app made every journalist, politician and participant's phone number public, Foster criticized.
A Conservative spokesman apologized for the leak.
He said that the technical problems have been solved and the application is now working safely.
The information leak was supported by the ICO in the UK.
The application was created by the Australian company Crown Comms.
The Opposition Labour Party criticises that the Conservative Party cannot be trusted in security matters.
Every week the audience of The Wall Finland quiz has a large number of clapping Poles
Attentive viewers drew attention to the reactions of the studio audience of The Wall Suomi quiz programme.
The Wall, which was rapidly spread worldwide, landed as a Finnish version at Nelonen last Saturday.
The game show hosted by Heikki Paasonen was shot in the same studio in Poland where other international productions of the format are made.
In the Polish studio, the shooting possibilities were exceptional, as the large 12-metre high playing wall required space for the farm.
During the start-up period, social media brought up a studio audience of the program, which was said to be Polish.
There was a discussion on Twitter about whether the Poles who might be sitting in the studio understand anything about the Finnish game.
Une Sormunen, Head of National Programmes at Nelonen, will shed light on the matter for Iltalehto.
He says that the audience of the studio is close to the players, other Finns living in Poland and just Polish viewers.
The audience is made up of international applauders in Finnish production, just like the audiences of other countries in the same production space.
In Finland, too, there are such groups, so-called professional audiences, who go to the descriptions of different programmes,” Sormunen says.
He reminds us that following the game itself is not so difficult to understand, even if you do not understand the language in which it is played.
Red and green balls falling from the wall are easy to distinguish from each other.
For foreign-language students, however, there are interpreters in the studio who carry out the translation work.
There are two interpreters who interpret the events as simultaneous interpreting for the studio director all the time.
And the studio director then instructs the audience and tells us what kind of flap is being thrown there, for example, and what the situation is going on, says Sormunen.
He compares the situation with how David Hasselhoff worked in domestic production recently.
A few years ago, David Hasselhoff was involved in Talent Finland's photo shoot at us in Finland.
He had simultaneous interpreting in his ear all the time, and he knew everything that was spoken in Finnish during the photo shoot, Sormunen sums up.
A typhoon shattering the south of Japan is moving towards the main islands - authorities are warning of landslides and floods
Authorities also warn against possible landslides and floods.
At least 50 people have been injured in typhoon Tram, but authorities say that major injuries have been avoided and that there are no data on the deaths.
On the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so strong that it has turned the cars around.
According to the NHK broadcaster, people have been evacuated in shields and more than 300 000 households have lost electricity.
Over a thousand flights have been canceled, and bullet trains are sometimes stopped due to a storm.
The storm is expected to strike near Osaka around half a day in Finnish time.
The capital of Tokyo is not directly on the route of the storm, but there are also strong winds and rains.
Trains have been canceled today in Tokyo.
According to weather scientists, Trami will torment Japan until Monday.
The sky of the aces darkened even more
It's been a bad season for aces.
The sky darkened almost black when the team lost 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1) to Vaasa Sport on Saturday.
The Pori now have five consecutive losses, and there are two points for six rounds.
No Aces defender or player in the two lower chains has scored yet.
The pressure is also increasing all the time.
Against Sport, the audience went away from the hall even when almost half of the game was left.
Six games have just been played, and of course there is no reason to give up.
Of course, we have to be concerned, because that's how weak we played.
Especially the performance of the second round was shamefully poor,” said Jarno Kärke, who made Aces with power 1 + 2.
Naturally, the sport had a taste of victory.
The team had a game below on Friday, so you should have thought it would appear in the process.
Maybe it did, but the Aces didn't know how to take advantage of it.
The number of visitors on Bread Day continued to grow
Mother of Bread Day Pirkko Hyvärinen wonders about the audience in the big hall.
Somehow you thought that maybe this year not so many people would come,” Hyvärinen ponders in the morning.
In the autumn of 2017, the Finnish Championships were held at the same time as Bread Day, so perhaps it would be expected that the number of audiences could even decrease slightly from the previous year.
However, the corridors were blocked well before 10, the sellers reported that products had run out, news porridge was sold more than 500 servings and Hyvärinen heard that there was an increase in the number of cars.
The estimated number of visitors has been around 6000, says Hyvärinen later this afternoon.
Five hours in the morning and afternoon could accommodate a lot of programs for families with children, which I think attracted a record number of them.
In addition, Hyvärinen estimates that the event will reach even more distance.
Salesmen also turn to Liperi every year from a larger area.
This year, almost a hundred rapporteurs, sellers of handicrafts, pastries and harvesting products had arrived at the bread keeper.
Mother of Bread Day Pirkko Hyvärinen admired the crowd in the hall's stands.
At the beginning of the bread day, the harvest was blessed.
In the children's series, Teija Kiviniemi's beautiful bread won the public vote.
11 breads of different shapes came to the children's bread contest.
The winner of the Rye Bread Competition Marjatta Vepsäläinen spent the day in the martto pie workshop.
7 x the most beautiful lamp - here you will recognize a good lamp
Bring the space to life, create the right atmosphere for the interior and read the book without getting tired of your eyes.
You should invest in good lighting.
We gathered together three good reasons to invest in lighting.
The tips were given by Tarja Jokiniemi, Director of Sales and Marketing at Innolux.
Do me a favor for your eyes.
The importance of lighting increases, the more age years are behind.
Adequate light can help with the problems that many people face with age, as visual acuity decreases and glare suffers more and more.
As you grow older, the need for light grows.
A man in his sixties needs three times as much light as a twenties.
Therefore, you should focus on the curative effects of light and on the properties of the lamp for health reasons.
A good lamp gives enough light, but does not dazzle,” Jokiniemi hints.
Create around you beauty
The beautiful interior can only be presented with the right lighting solutions.
The interior of the present room can afford to choose.
Popularity is the Japanese style that combines Scandinavian and Japanese.
On the other hand, the modern and playful retro style inspired by the 70s, with its strong colours, different shades of metal or ice cream colours has risen up to boom.
Authenticity is fascinated by the same way as the rest of the home interior.
In the materials now appear wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Expand your personality
On the other hand, home is being invested more than before, and interior design has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, you want a tailor-made lamp that has a story to tell.
People are clearly looking for Finnish and Nordic products whose origin and designer are known.
So let's be very design-conscious, says Jokiniemi.
It is not necessarily necessary to buy the latest trendy lamp for your home, but a timeless classic that has been saved for many years.
Certain types of timeless, jewellery and elegant classics hold their ground year after year, says Jokiniemi.
Thank you and goodbye!
Kookoo showed the door to the Canadian attacker after three games.
And the attacker, Brendan O'Donnell, will separate.
The Canadian attacker played three League matches in orange black with no power points, says Kookoo in his announcement.
O'Donnell moved to Kookoo in August with a one-year contract, which included a probationary period until the end of September.
Last season, the 26-year-old attacker played KHL in the ranks of Kunlund Red Star and at the KHL farm in VHL in KRS Heilongjiang.
There's no record of O'Donnell's new company yet.
The player wants to set an example in recycling - the goods go out to the world in recycled boxes, plastic changed to paper
Games specialty store Players recycles not only games but also packaging materials.
Our products are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in paper bags made of recycled material.
Products ordered from the online store are packaged in packages from importers, for example.
All packages that come to us will be reused.
We may use the boxes a dozen times, as long as the package is in the condition that it can be used,” says Ville Puurula from Oulu Pelimiehen.
As a padding material, the company uses, as a rule, newspapers and other similar recycled material.
Bubble plastic is avoided as far as possible.
In the near future, we are expected to switch to recycled material, even in envelopes.
The movement wants to set an example to others.
According to Puuurula, recycling does not cause any extra trouble.
It's not a big problem to start recycling.
There will also be financial savings when, for example, cardboard packaging is reused.
Recycling is a natural way to play, because in addition to new products, the store's key product range includes, among other things, used games and equipment.
Acquisition for every fashionista: One shirt works in every outfit.
Classic clothes work from season to season as in outfit.
They create the basis for a good garderobi because quality classics make it easy to assemble different outfits at a low cost.
The most used classics of the wardrobe in autumn are quality knitwear.
This category also includes black polo.
A black sweater made of natural material with turtleneck collars can not be a mistake acquisition.
It can be combined with straight trousers, tulle skirt and jeans, and you can create both a restrained outfit and a snug style around it.
The polo knit is suitable for both a youthful modern dress-case and a classic sophisticated stylist.
This is how you create a style.
The autumn trend boot comes from golden brown and flared corduroy trousers, black polo knit and grey ankle boots.
Classic polo knit combined with other classics, blue-green Scottish skirt and burgundy loafers create a feminine and sophisticated outfit.
Bring fringe to the black polo knit by combining it with casual trendy items: a denim skirt, high boots and thick tights.
Youthful and stylish!
There is a long tradition of sabotage by Russian intelligence services
There is no reason to assume that the Foreign Intelligence SVR of the Russian Federation or the Military Intelligence GRU would have abandoned this mode of operation.
During the Soviet Union, the so-called DRG groups specialised in sabotage operations.
The name comes from the Russian words diversionno-razvedyvatelnaja group: sabotage and reconnaissance group.
The KGB's agents in the western world prepared detailed plans for important sabotage sites, says KGB archivist Vasili Mitroh (1922 - 2004), defected to the west of the KGB.
His knowledge was published in Christopher Andrew's books at the end of the 1990s and early 2000s
The targets included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil refineries and gas pipelines.
In Germany, the KGB acquired the DRG teams uniforms and accessories for the Bundeswehr, railways, game guards and road workers for undercover operations.
This tik was worn by Russian paratroopers in Crimea in February 2014: they dressed in local Ukrainian police riot equipment, set up checkpoints on roads leading from the peninsula to Ukraine and isolated Crimea from their motherland.
During the Cold War agents hid supplies for sabotage groups in the terrain with mines, explosives, detonators and communications equipment.
Even in 1998, a KGB stash was found in Switzerland, whose trap mine exploded when the authorities sprayed it with a water cannon.
Police reached four drunks in the province last night.
The police caught four drunken driving in various parts of North Karelia on the night of Friday and Saturday.
In Joensuu, an 18-year-old Kontiolahti man blew 1.57 per million.
He drove around 4:30 in the night at the beginning of the Kajaanintie with two passengers.
On Kinnojärvi Kuuevaara road, the car derails in a ditch at four o'clock in the night, and a 19-year-old local man, who was alone in the car, blew 1.54 per million, according to the police.
He didn't have any serious injuries on the way out.
A 20-year-old man driving a passenger car in the centre of Outokumpu blew 1.33 per million on the breathalyzer.
The police suspect the male drivers in question of serious drunk driving and the driver of the Polvijärvi lake also of endangering road safety.
On Saturday morning at Tuupovaara at the intersection of Öllöläntie and Hoikantie, a 36-year-old man carrying a van blew 0.52 per cent.
He's a suspect for DUI.
Police are asking for sightings of a stabbing that took place at Turku railway station after midnight.
Police say that a man was assaulted in a parking lot outside the station with fatal consequences.
The act was recorded on a security camera.
The dark-haired suspects dressed in dark trousers and brown or beige jacket left immediately after stabbing in a dark station wagon in the direction of Rataphankatua bus station.
One of the suspects was riding a bicycle on Humaliston street in the direction of downtown.
Pedestrian died after being hit by a bus in Pori
A pedestrian died early Saturday morning in Pori after a bus hit him.

True story today on TV: A climber was left to die twice
Eighteen years ago, American Beck Weathers wrote a book.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on a man's own experience.
Tonight's film is made on the basis of them.
Everest is now premiered on Finnish TV.
In May 1996, a devastating blizzard caught climbers on Mount Everest.
Baltasar Kormákur's control of 2015 tells about the struggle for survival, which has been treated with grain.
Tragedy has been made into films and documentaries before.
Real events are also going through in this case.
22 years ago, the highest mountain in the world took the lives of eight climbers.
Two of them were experienced leaders of expeditions: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It was Hall that served as a guide for Weathers.
Weathers' life could be saved by an eye surgery performed before going to Nepal.
As a result of that and atmospheric pressure, he lost sight, which is why the conquest of the peak had to be missed.
Rob Hall moved on and never came back.
But Weathers' struggle for life and death had just begun.
When the storm rose, he got lost and couldn't find his way back to camp.
When they came looking for him, they found him in such a bad condition that they couldn't believe in survival.
Weathers were left to die.
But, by miracle, he still got on his feet and found the others.
The severely frostbite Weathers was thought to be still dying and, once again, he was left to his own fate.
Obviously, against other expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, even fellow climbers began to believe in the possibility of being given help.
In the movie Beck Weathers is played by Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
Today, the 200-year-old Eno Church has been celebrated.
Uncle's 200-year-old church has been celebrated today on a hill of church.
The church was inaugurated on October 4, 1818, and in honor of the anniversary, a celebration of the whole family was prepared for Sunday.
The party started on the hill of Eno church at 10 o'clock at the family show, after which the Karelian banquet table has been served at the Eno parish house.
The church was full.
517 people participated in the family show.
Uncle's vicar Armi Rautavuori was glad that so many people had come to the church.
It will be a great pleasure for a long time and will give strength to the work, says Rautavuori (pictured).
The fire of the Church of Acceleration has touched many and was not ignored at the 200th anniversary of Eno's parish.
The church of Eno is now the oldest of the Evangelical Lutheran churches in Joensuu since the fire destroyed the Church of Accelerating danger.
The wooden church of Iontelysvaara was completed in 1770.
A devotion was organised in the morning at the risk of agitation, in which the church destroyed in the fire was silenced and remembered.
Photos and videos: The Medican flashed his power in Greece - The sea disappeared and the street turned into a river
A strong hurricane-type autumn storm raged from southwest to Greece on Saturday.
The Mediterranean hurricane, known as the medican, has been named Zorba.
The Greek Meteorological Institute has issued a red weather warning for the regions of Attica, the Peloponnese, the Ionian Islands, the Cyclades and Crete.
The pictures taken from the area show a lot of flooding around Greece.
A video published on Twitter shows how a river flooding has suddenly appeared between the houses in the Kiatto city of Korinthia instead of the street.
The second video shows how the car has been transported by flood waters.
In the southern part of the Peloponnese Peninsula, a strong wind caused strong sea traffic.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens instructs people on its Facebook page to prepare for a storm in Greece.
The delegation urges that the weather reports and local authorities should be followed.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or the medican, brings with it heavy rains and even the danger of flooding.
According to CNN, a study published in 2011 shows that medicans only occur once or twice a year throughout the world, typically around September-October, when the sea temperature is still high.
The storm now blowing left floods in Tunisia and Libya before continuing its journey north and towards Europe.
There is also concern in Greece about refugee camps on islands such as Lesbos.
The chances of thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in the camps are limited.
In the summer, the areas destroyed by fires around Athens will also be affected by the storm.
There was also a medican in Greece last November.
We should not go to the sea now, flights are still on schedule - thousands of Finns are currently vacationing on Greek islands threatened by the autumn storm
Excursions to the sea are canceled, and even when walking, you should be careful not to fly branches or other bulk items on top of the storm.
These guides have given over 3,500 Finnish people who are vacationing through Sun Trips in Greece during the weekend.
Instructions will be needed because even the terrible storm Zorbass has been predicted to beat the Greek islands this weekend.
For example, near the island of Crete, wind speed can rise in gusts of up to 45 meters per second.
The wretch of the weather is enhanced by the heavy rains.
According to tour operators, all travellers travelling to Greece from Finland via Sun Trip and Tui who have given their telephone number have been warned of strong winds by SMS.
In the air still sun and warmth
According to Inka Ikonen, an expert in solar travel communications, the worst has been avoided at resorts by Saturday early evening.
For example, flights have landed and boarded according to a normal schedule.
Of course, we follow the situation all the time.
Safety first we go.
The media dispatcher Antonia Schroderus says that their flights have also been scheduled.
We are in constant contact with our staff on the site.
At least Crete was still quiet, he told me on Saturday early evening.
In the most popular Greek islands, Rhodes and Crete, there are currently just over 1 500 Finnish passengers.
In addition, a few hundred passengers are vacationing in smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm on the island of Kos is likely to reach on Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon in Rhodes, the sun was mocked and the temperature was up to 27 degrees,” says Ikonen of Sun Trips.
It is estimated that Zorbas will become the next problem for Turkey, albeit slightly weakened.
We have already been in contact with Turkey and our staff there and checked, for example, the number of Finns flying to Antalya in Tut, says Schroderus.
Shirly Karvise and Janni Huss completely identical evening dresses in the mission final - this is how they react to the situation
Media personality and fitness beauty Janni Hussi arrived at the Miss Suomi finals on Saturday in an open-back evening dress.
Hussi says he got a dress from Meslew.
I went to the store and decided to trust the professionals who found me the perfect suit for tonight, Hussi smiles.
Exactly the same silver evening dress was also chosen by the host Shirly Garvinen.
The duo also noticed their similar costumes and looked at the situation with a laugh.
Garfield told Ilta-Sanomi that he had been busy preparing, and he had to get dressed in a plane.
Hussi is a backstage and red carpet presenter in the mission finals, and he is talking to the front row stars arriving at the scene.
Huss has recently moved to Jätkäsaari on Friday from Kamppi to Jätkäsaari
I'm gonna stay there for now, see what happens.
It is essential that the new apartment has its own office,” Hussi said.
Before he moved, Hussi was on vacation alone in Greece.
It was wonderful. I was only in a hotel for a week without going anywhere.
When the stress erupted, I got the flu, but otherwise the vacation was really successful,” Hussi says.
Shirly Karinen's behavior on the plane attracted a lot of attention - gathered curious glances of pensioners
The presenter and Miss Suomi Shirly Garvinen of 2016 reported that she had plenty to do with radio hosts and Love Island Finland filming on the red carpet of the Miss Suomi Final.
The haste has been enough even to the extent that Karvinen arrived directly from Finnair's flight to the final.
I put on makeup and put my hair on the plane.
This is the glamor.
Change of evening dresses at home, Garfield laughs.
Garfield says he pulled out his makeup among the pensioners.
His preparation also attracted the attention of fellow passengers.
I had a big mirror and I saw people in the mirror.
At least the others thought my makeup was amusing.
Garfield flies to Spain once a week.
In Marbella, she spends about a few days at a time.
Karvinen says he enjoyed his position as host of Love Island Finland.
He describes his experience so far also stopping.
Garfield says he went to say hi Friday night on the show.
In some ways, it's really brutal.
These are people's real feelings, Garfield describes the feelings of the single people in the show.
How do I wear overknee boots?
Three perfect exemplary outfits
Classic clothing is a piece of clothing that works from season to season in an outfit as an outfit.
Often the classics are decades old, but sometimes you can accommodate even more modern individuals.
A few years ago, the overknee boots, which became the hit shoes of the autumn-winter season, have not gone away anywhere.
As the name suggests, the boots above the knee are repeated in style year and season after season.
Showy boots share the opinions of users, but a bold model is worth trying, well - boldly.
Over-knee boots are really suitable for any type of outfit.
Whether it's jeans, lace, tulle or tights, the simple leather or artificial leather finish of the boots will work.
Long boots look great both in party looms and in everyday outfits.
Black overknee boots are great for even the most subdued outfits.
They harmoniously balance the femininity of a pink, flower plush skirt and a gentle, plush sweater.
Fresh, yet elegant everyday outfit for romantic taste.
A strong and slightly retro-inspired outfit comes from a long copper-brown velvet dress, overknee boots, spectacular earrings and a riveting bag.
Although the overknee boots have a certain sophistication, they are also perfect for casual everyday wear in combination with a t-shirt, long shorts and a trendy baseball cap.
Wonderfully easy and yet so stylish!
Two robotic cars start operating in Espoo
They will operate for the rest of the year and pick up passengers,” Espoo City informs.
The robotic cars in Otaniemi will play the role of a bus simulator, because next spring the route is to start traffic on a robot bus.
The project develops and pilots year-round robotic vehicle traffic and tests the technical functionality of vehicles in Finnish conditions.
The experiment finds out how robotic cars are doing with the current street network.
At the same time, the city offers robotic bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real environment, says traffic management manager Johanna Nyberg.
For the first time, robotic cars run completely automatically with other traffic without special transport arrangements.
Vehicle safety is always the responsibility of an auxiliary passenger on board.
Vehicles are constantly sensing their surroundings with multiple sensors and assess whether the driveway is free.
If it is not, they will interpret whether the detected obstacle is a vehicle, a bicycle or, for example, a snowflake, says Harri Santamala, CEO of Sensible 4, responsible for the development of robotic traffic.
Robotic cars run throughout the autumn three days a week: on Tuesdays from 13 to 15:30, on Wednesdays from 10-15 and on Thursdays at 10-15.
Robot cars stop at six stops along the route and take passengers on board.
Robotic car stops can be identified by the stop markings.
The most secure ride can be reached from stop 1 on Otakaari.
Mokoma band bass player fell off stage in the middle of the show and was injured
Mokoma band announces a surprising situation at Tampere Pakhahuone concert on its Facebook page.
Mokoma band's gig at Tampere Pakkahuone took a dramatic turn on Saturday when the band's bass player Santtu Hämäläinen fell off the stage in the middle of the performance.
The situation happened when the band was doing the last song of the night.

Let's wish the metal brother a speedy recovery!
The rest of the tour is done by a back-up. It says on the pages.
Fans of Mokoma are concerned to respond to the image update where Santtu bassist is lying with plaster in his hand on the bed.
I've been waiting for this news. I was pretty worried about how bad it happened.
The relief is great, the bones heal fortunately over time.
Good luck and a quick recovery to Santu and a good tour for the rest of the band plus the replacement!
And thank you for yesterday, it was a great gig, but you promise to leave out such a strong drama about the end of the gigs in the future, right? writes a fan.
Police supervised hunting in North Karelia and Savo
The Eastern Finland Police Department conducted hunting surveillance on Friday and Saturday with Metsähallitus and the Finnish Game Centre in North Karelia and Ylä-Savo. The police department's wilderness liaison reported in social media on Saturday.
The main focus of control was on the legality and permits of hunting.
Each hunter was checked with a hunting license and a hunting license required on state land.
In addition, the licenses for the possession of hunting weapons and the permitted number of rounds of self-infecting weapons used in chickening were checked.
According to the police, 112 hunters were inspected during the surveillance and only one hunter who lacked the required hunting license.
The hunter was fined 12 days for unauthorized hunting.
In addition, 133 drivers of the vehicle were blown by the police, two of whom are suspected of being drunk driving.
In addition, patrols dealt with five traffic violations in a fine procedure, police times.
In conclusion, it can be noted that hunters adhere to the permissibility of hunting very well.
A lot of hunters were surprised by the surveillance.
One hunter said that “I have been hunting in the area for 50 years and this was the first time anyone has checked the permits”.
The Eastern Finland Police Department will continue hunting control in the autumn together with other supervisory authorities.
Mykkänen goes to Turkey to follow the selection of Syrian quota refugees
Minister of the Interior Kai Mykkänen (Kai Mykkänen) will travel to Turkey in the next few days to monitor the selection of quota refugees coming to Finland.
It has been decided to take 530 Syrian refugees to Finland this year from Turkish refugee camps.
Selection trips are usually made a couple of times a year, with representatives from the Finnish Immigration Service, the Ministry of Employment and the Economy and the police.
The delegation is already in Turkey conducting interviews.
The UN Refugees Organisation, UNHCR, will first elect particularly vulnerable people.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered to be particularly in distress in refugee camps, for example single-parent families, the disabled and the sick, women and children.
More people are selected for the group coming to Finland than there are in the quota, because in practice some of them do not arrive for various reasons.
Mykkänen will also meet Turkish Minister of the Interior, Süleyman Soylu, and NGOs working on the Syrian border.
Ilkka Salmi, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of the Interior, will also be present.
Speaking of raising the quota
Finland has taken quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees per year.
The quota was 1 050 per year for a couple of years, but since then there has been no agreement in the government to raise it.
The Coalition has been in favour of raising the quota, but the project has recently fallen under the blue resistance.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (middle) recently proposed a gradual increase in the quota to 1 500 to 2 000 people a year.
Mykkänen's visit will be the first time the Minister of the Interior will make on the spot to monitor the selection of quota refugees.
Previous Interior Ministers Petteri Orpo (ECR) and Paula Risikko (ECR) had time to move on to their new positions before the visits were arranged.
Finland receives EUR 10 000 from the EU for every particularly vulnerable refugee.
Now let's go on the bad roads. You don't know if you're gonna cry or laugh anymore.
Karjalainen reported last Saturday a bill to amend the Animal Welfare Act.
The article gave the impression that the bill in principle prohibits the keeping of all animals that are not explicitly permitted by ministerial regulations as farm animals, pets or otherwise in connection with business activities.
So everything else is, in principle, prohibited except for animals specifically mentioned in the regulation.
If the bill goes into law, it should mean that in Western democracies we are rejecting the general principle of explicitly prohibiting activities that jeopardise social security or good manners.
In principle, we are now in the process of prohibiting any activity which is not explicitly authorised by law or regulation.
The change means that nothing new can be tried, for example, in business, or anything else done until a law or regulation approving it has been adopted.
The government's work in the drafting of legislation in general has been weak.
If we go on the road that, in principle, everything is prohibited in Finland, which is not permitted separately, you no longer know whether to cry or laugh.
I have no doubt that the Animal Protection Act requires an update.
But a legislative project in this direction is not part of democracy.
Unfortunately, I am not very familiar with the Constitution, but I wonder whether it will accept such a procedure as “everything is prohibited not explicitly permitted by law or regulation”.
Hopefully, there will be some sensible minister who will suspend this kind of legal project.

In Turkey, they are advised to charge mobile phones in case of a storm
The storm Zorba, which blew in Greece on Saturday, is expected to move to Turkey on Sunday.
On Saturday, meteorologists warned sailors, fishermen and farmers on the west coast of the country about the storm in Greece, writes CNN Türk.
The tropical storm is reported to be moving along the coast from south to north during the day.
At the beginning of the evening, the disaster and emergency authorities called on citizens to download their mobile phones before the storm and ensure that the internet connectivity works so that people can receive timely updates,” says Anadolu Ajansi, local news agency.
People have been advised to stay at home and away from windows, and to move garden furniture away from the wind, for example.
Turkey is expected to have heavy rain and wind blows from 28 to 33 metres per second.
In Greece, the red weather warning
On Saturday, the Greek Meteorological Service issued a red weather warning to southern Greece for the regions of Attica, Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades and Crete.
The Ministry for Foreign Affairs and travel agencies organising trips to Greece warned Finns in Greece about the storm Zorba.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens also issued a storm warning.
Travellers were advised to follow weather reports and instructions from local authorities.
Not long ago, when I contacted you, there was a strong wind and it rained.
People were calm,” Communications Manager Laura Aaltonen from TUI travel agency told the BTI on Saturday.
Aaltonen described the situation as similar on Saturday night.
By the end of the evening, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs had not received any messages about the Finns in need.
In Greece, several ports were not operated on Saturday, told the local news agency Amna.
Boat trips to the sea were canceled on Saturday, the travel agencies were told to the BTI.
According to the Finnish Embassy in Athens, temporary disturbances were expected to occur in air and ship traffic.
Finnair was told on Saturday that the weather situation was actively monitored.
Kimi Räikkönen summed up the reason for Mercedes' superiority over Ferrari
Kimi Räikkönen from Ferrari was admitted that the worst competitor Mercedes was too tough in the Russian gp time.
However, there is no reason to panic in the Ferrari camp, the experienced driver assesses.
They were just faster than us, but there's nothing huge about it.
Our car was the best in time for the whole weekend so far, but they were just too fast,” said Räikkönen and his teammate Sebastian Vettel, who clearly missed Mercedes speed.
The Ferrari had a hard time in the last race in Singapore.
Ratchet was asked what caused a sudden fall off a Mercedes ride.
They seem to go faster than us - that's how simple it is.
If I knew the reason for that, we'd probably be going at the same rate as they did.
But I don't know any more than anyone else.
This is always speculation, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
In the time periods we saw a rare treat for Sauber in Räikköen's future stable.
Räikköen's replacement for Ferrari next season Charles Leclerc was the seventh, and the final qualifying session was also Marcus Ericsson.
For a Swedish driver, the tenth starting point is best for over three years.
And even though there were no more than five drivers in the second ride, the result was still tasty for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging Ratikköne in view of the future?
Yes, if you compare with where they were from the early season, then the step forward has been a big one.
There's a different story next year, so let's see, let's see.
It was there - Robert Helenius knocked out Erka Teper: “Robbe is back”
The match between Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper in Stuttgart night was steady.
The German was a more proactive party in the ring, but he didn't get a good hit.
Clearly beyond the reach of Helenius controls the match with his hard-to-reach leagues, who found their way.
The Finnish was also clearly in better physical condition than Teper.
The solution finally came in the eighth round, when Helenius knocked out Teper with his left straight.
The hit was so hard that the old man who fought in front of the home audience didn't even try to get out of the carpet.
After the victory was confirmed, Helenius was quite moderately ventilated.
In the ring interview, he first praised the good mood created by the audience and his opponent.
Then he changed his language to Finnish for a while.
Thank you to all viewers and Finnish incentives.
We brought the belt today.
Helenius rejoiced right after the match.
It was a very big victory for Helenius' career.
It might even be possible to get to the World Cup,” Helenius commented to the IltaMagazine before the match.
Instead, defeat could have finished the entire boxing career.
Of course it has crossed my mind.
This is not getting any younger, 34-year-old Helenius admitted before the encounter with Teper.
The number of victims of the Indonesian disaster could multiply
According to The Guardian magazine, the Vice President of the country urges you to prepare for a sharp rise in the number of victims.
According to the Vice President of the country, Jusuf Kallas, the total number of victims could reach thousands.
Severe conditions
The rescuers are looking for traps and also the dead in the most affected areas of Sulawes Island: the port town of Palau and the neighbouring town of Donggala.
So far, all the victims are from Palau, the situation in Donggala is not yet clear.
Hundreds of people are missing and about 540 are badly injured.
There are still people in the collapsed buildings that rescuers haven't been able to get out.
For example, a hotel called Roa Roa in Palu has collapsed.
Rescuers say they heard the screams of people trapped in the ruins, but the lack of grubbing-up equipment has delayed the start of the rescue work.
Indonesian President, either Widodo, has ordered an army rescue and clearance.
There is a need for the army and its equipment, because in the disaster area there are many places where electricity and communications are cut off.
Fuel reserves are also exhausting.
Miss Suomi's hesitating response and lengthy reflection caused a laugh
The new Miss Finland is currently being selected at Billnäs Ruuki.
During the interview round, each missifinalist was asked a question.
The finalists drew a question about the glass bowl on the stage.
In particular, finalist number six Emilia Anttikoski, 23, the hesitant response made the audience present a sweet but benevolent laugh.
The question asked to Anttikoski was customs via Facebook.
The user Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what is the latest book that a missifinalist has read.
Anttikoski thought about his answer for a good time before he started hesitating.
Thank you for the question, Pirkko-Ella.
The last book I've read is... Anttikoski said thinking.
The rethink pause made a laugh in the audience until Anttikoski continued his answer:
The last book I've read is...
I've read books in school!
Must be something economics related.
So the last book I read is economics someone, Anttikoski replied.

Siken apple-pear cake takes his tongue away
This recipe is for you who have good, acidic apples on your own, because the domestic apple is in the store at a shocking price.
You might have to buy a pear, although I think quite a lot of people are already growing that pear tree.
This cake can also be made only from apples, if there is no desire to buy a pear.
The taste, of course, will be more diverse if you also put a pear in the cake.
Peel apples and pear and remove the seed buds.
Slice it.
Melt the butter in a saucepan.
Whisk the eggs and sugar until foam, and then add to the foam corn flour, as well as melted butter.
Combine the corn starch or maizena with the baking powder and add them to the dough.
Add almond flour and wheat flour, mix well.
Lining the bread casserole with baking paper, sprinkling 2 tablespoons of sugar on the bottom of the pan and spread the pear slices over the sugar.
Spoon half the dough on top of the pear slices, and apple slices on top of the dough.
Spoon the rest of the dough on top of the apple slices.
Cook in the oven at 180 degrees for about an hour until the surface is beautiful brown.
Allow to cool in a pan and then set aside on a serving dish.
Cut the cake until properly cooled.
The cake is brittle in structure and crumbles easily because the dough contains almond and corn flour without gluten.
International Criminal Literature Event will be held in Ruka in January

Status Symbols Do Not Attract Friends - Four Facts About Popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic or admired?
Researchers at the University of Sydney have outlined two species of “cool” with slightly different characteristics: the generally attractive cool and the opposite dissident cool.
Charmingly cool people, according to the description of scientists, had many socially desirable traits: they were outward, friendly, friendly and competent.
Dissidents, on the other hand, were characterised by distance, independence, rebellion and edge.
They were thirsty for experience and cared little about outsiders' assessments.
Both types were united by good self-esteem and stable emotional life.
The role of a tough guy is not cool in the long run: high status in a teenager may not lead to success later in life.
This is what the American study published in Child Development in 2014.
Young people who were dating early, partying, getting into a bunch of good-looking folks, and trying to be popular with others, had an increased risk of drug abuse and committing crimes as young adults.
In their relationships, they did weaker than their former less noticeable peers.
Luke cars, branded bags or watches that communicate high status do not make a person cool - or at least a genuinely attractive company.
In a study published in Social Psychological and Personality Science in August, the majority of people were more prepared to make friends with a normal supermarket shirt than a brand shirt - despite the fact that most of them chose to wear a brand shirt during their acquaintance.
If you are on the Greek holiday islands, watch out!
There's a hurricane hitting it. A weather warning screaming red.
During the weekend, southern Greece can rain as much water as Finland average over six months.
Hurricane Zorbass will hit Greece over the weekend.
Be prepared for this if you are in the Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades or Crete area.
The storm is very strong, so the Finnish Embassy in Athens will announce it on its Facebook page.
According to the High Approach, the Greek Meteorological Service has issued a red weather warning to the regions.
The weather service Foreca's blog is also reported about the approaching storm.
According to it, the strongest gust in the storm is up to 45 meters per second.
For comparison, the Kuisma storm, which beated Finland at the beginning of the week, blew more than 31 meters per second.
However, according to the blog, the main concern of the Zorbas storm is not the wind, but the heavy rains.
At the weekend in southern Greece, more than 300 millimeters of water can come.
It accounts for about half of Finland's annual rainfall.
The weather service Severe Weather Europa has shared a video about the development of the storm on its Facebook page.
The Zorbas storm has caused flooding in Tunisia and Libya earlier this week.
Do you recognize the Love Island Suomi Anu, drooled by men?
Occurs on confusing YouTube videos
Few people know that in Love Island Finland series, Anku, drooled by several men, will also perform as a craft aunt on strange YouTube videos released in 2010.
In the videos, Anku advises craftsmen, among other things, how to make an octopus out of an old kitchen paper roll.
Anku also shows in his sympathetic style how from tights you can crave a hedgehog that grows the right spikes.
Now, let's plant the Easter grass, but let's do it in a somewhat surprising way, Anku hints and shows sawdust, pantyhose and seeds of rubble, from which he will make a hedgehog.

Valtteri Bottas was shaking and bursting adrenaline in Sochi - will he be assisted by Hamilton on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas was shaking a little more tens of minutes after his Russian gp pole position, while he was in front of the media.
The exquisite tour left Mercedes's number one star Lewis Hamilton and was mentally undoubtedly an important criticism for the Finnish driver who had gathered this season.
Nice round.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he dropped out of the settlement round.
I feel good, I'm still shaking a little, Bottas figured out.
I have only been on the pole once this year, in Austria (in the middle of summer), so a lot of time has passed.
This track has been good for me in the past, and I got again good laps.
The Sochi track is not easy to overtake, so the slots play a particularly big role.
And, of course, Bottas had a question about whether he was going for victory tomorrow or whether he was ahead of getting Hamilton on the way to the World Championship title.
My starting point for the race is definitely that I'm trying to win.
There can be no other goal when you leave the pile, Bottas piled up.
But as a stable, we will fight for both championships.
Lewis's lead to Sebastian Vettel is pretty big and the difference between me is very big, so you have to keep that in mind.
Let's see what happens, but Bottas did.
After the ride, Hamilton was genuinely happy with Bottas “success, and the one seen for Mercedes” team boss Toto Wolff was good.
Lewis had an intention to beat Valtteri, but he didn't make it at the 7th.
Valtteri knows he has to rip everything out of himself to defeat Lewis.
And he was so charged that adrenaline burst out of his ears, Wolff glows.
To the question of whether the stable will allow Bottas and Hamilton to drive honorably, Wolff answered dodging.
We'll talk tomorrow morning and see how the race goes.
Kiteeläe Erno Kinnunen achieved the Finnish Rally Championship
The SM-series of rally car racing ended rarely.
Hardly ever before the brothers have ended up being Finnish champions at the same time.
This was done by Tuusulans Eerik and Henrik Pietarinen at the final rally in Turku and Salo, as Eerik won SM1 and Henrik SM2 class.
Kiteean Erno Kinnunen secured the best achievement of his career when the third place in the final race sealed him the Finnish championship of the SM4 two-wheel cars.
Kinnunen and map reader Ville Mäkelä, competing at Honda Civic, started the Turku Event with restraint, because the starting points were clear: ranking in the top group would guarantee the SM-title.
In the darkness of Friday night, the two had to give a handicap when some of the additional lights were betrayed by another special experiment.
You had to sip a third bit pretty blindly.
In a situation like that, it's not a good place to be.
On Saturday, only the speed of Jussi Tepo, who was second in the series,” Kinnunen said.
Syria calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops
The Syrian Foreign Minister calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
The Ukrainian military violated the rule of the DPR Defenders, "reported on Tuesday the Vice-Commander of the DPR Defenders.
The Ukrainian military shelled the territory of the Republic two times, “reported on the Vice-President of the Republic two times,” reported on the Vice-President of the Republic two times.
In his UN speech, Muallem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return to their homeland.
But there is no end to the war that went on for seven years.
Over 360 000 people have died in the war.
On Friday in Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel said that a meeting in Syria was planned for October, accompanied by French, Russian and Turkish presidents.
Not exactly the Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans were watching the Supreme Court Judgement drama on TV.
The Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh and Professor Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of harassment, got an exceptionally large number of people at the screens.
In the United States, the nomination drama of a Supreme Court judge in full power got at least 20 million people on their television on Thursday.
At that time, Kavanaugh, nominated by Donald Trump, and California professor Blasey Ford, accusing him of harassment, were before the Senate Justice Committee to tell their story.
According to the preliminary results, the hearings were followed by 20,4 million viewers on the six main channels, ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC.
In addition to them, there were several million more following online consultation.
NBC reported that the live stream was followed by 6.8 million people and CNN reported that it had set its record for the year with 8.2 million live launches.
CNN's figure will rise to over 10 million, including those who followed the broadcast via YouTube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital also got 8.0 million launches.
Digital startup is the channel's own, TV viewers come from Nielsen, a research and data analysis company.
Nielsen will publish the final readings on Monday, but they will be dizzy anyway.
Few can reach 20 million.
More than 20 million viewers in the United States are usually only sporting matches and major Oscar and Grammy gala in entertainment, as well as occasional political events such as speeches by presidents and in 2016 also presidential discussions.
Of course, the United States's most watched annual show, the American Football League NFL finals, Super Bowl is a long way away.
This year, the Super Bowl gathered around 103 million people on the NBC channel.
Last year, Trump's first speech to Congress was viewed by a total of almost 48 million people and over 30 million inauguration.
High-priority issue
The nomination of a Supreme Court judge is an extremely important case in the United States, given that the posts are lifelong.
Trump was already able to appoint one new judge when Antonin Scalia died in early 2016 and the Republicans managed to prevent President Barack Obama from appointing a successor to him.
Second place opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced his retirement this year.
Mr Kennedy was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, but he was, on a number of issues, a so-called scales language, the voice of which could determine the position of a nine-person court.
She was a supporter of the right to abortion and the rights of sexual minorities and, for example, in 2015, decided with her vote that same-sex people had the right to marry in the whole federal state.
Kavanaugh is far more conservative.
His election to the Supreme Court could lock the court of Conservative domination for decades.
Children have the right to receive their information to parents
Only parents of children under 10 years of age can access their children's health records from the Kanta service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong, and it's weird.
Originally, the situation of the Kanta service was of course even more worrying: parents could not even look at the health records or recipes of the little ones.
This situation was described as temporary in autumn 2016 for persons under 10 years of age.
Since then, practice has been promised to be corrected, but it has taken an astonishing long time.
Now the repair is in place - in 2020.
Since the problem is clear, the change in the legal base should not have been more than a bust case.
After that, with the understanding of the layman, it is a push of a button: now that the plume is closed, open it.
Of course, a child can show his information to his parents if he has a bank ID or an official ID card.
But how many 10-year-olds have?
An ID card is subject to a fee, and a 10-year-old doesn't even get bank credentials.
In practice, no one can see the data of a 4th grade in primary school except by requesting it printed.
It is not so much a matter of parental rights as of children.
It is extremely important for the care of a child that parents can be involved in it.
Of course, the right to privacy of teenagers must be taken care of.
Even minors can have family situations where all things are not freely discussed.
Often they relate to sexual health, for which free care is a deeply relevant human right.
In the United States, the FBI began to revoke allegations of harassment against Kavanaugh.
According to American media, the FBI is investigating allegations of harassment made by at least two women.
One of the women was before the Senate Justice Committee earlier this week.
Kavanaugh has denied accusations of alleged sexual harassment during his studies.
US President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate allegations at the request of the Senate Judicial Committee.
The investigation shall not take more than a week.
According to the Washington Post, this is a more limited investigation than a criminal investigation, and it may not become public.
He threatened to kill cops at a police station in Kajaan.
The captured brawler continued to bull in the chamber.
The police say that they put a man in a police prison to “calm down”.
Police were threatened by a suspect assailant on Saturday night in Kajaan.
Officials are reporting an incident that was triggered by a man over 30 years of age who had a fierce fight in a downtown restaurant.
The man first assaulted another client inside the nutrition store.
This resulted in the removal of the restaurant.
Outside, a fighter attacked another man by knocking him down.
When a third party tried to intervene, he hit her, too.
Trinity assault led to the call of the police.
The patrol caught the man and took Kajaani to the police station, says the police.
Suspect still behaved aggressively at the police station.
He kicked another cop in the leg.
He threatened to kill and assault the cops.
The police say that they have put a man into a police prison to “calm down”.
The man is suspected of three assaults and violent opposition to an official.
Aid organizations are preparing to start work on Sulawesi, Indonesia - “Clean water is the most urgent”
The UN Children's Organization Unicef and other international aid organisations are ready to help the Indonesian island of Sulawes, says Kirsi Haru, Head of Information at Unicef, Finland.
Local authorities are leading the rescue work, but the need for further assistance is already evident at this stage.
Unicef operates in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programmes in Indonesia.
In addition to normal operation, Unicefi always has full emergency response capability, says Haru.
The first task now is to find the people in the ruins, both the survivors and the dead.
In Palau in Sulawes, rescue operations are under way, but in the Donggala area a little further north, the situation is less clear.
There are still places to which connections do not work.
Aid measures are difficult because roads are also broken,” says Haru.
The buildings in Sulawesi are often lightweight, so the devastation caused by the earthquake and tsunami is great.
Once the survivors have been found, they need shelter, first of all, like tents and clean water.
Clean water is the most urgent in a crisis situation.
First of all, people are mostly able to offer water purification tablets, which Unicefi also has in stock.
The aim is to repair water systems as soon as possible, but in the event of an emergency, water is transported for example by trucks.
In crisis situations, many children are forced to get rid of their parents.
Finding family members and reunifying families is one part of the UNICEF mission field.
Food aid, on the other hand, is organised by the World Food Programme (WFP), which is part of the UN.
At the initial stage, funds collected earlier are used for emergency aid.
However, Unicef, among others, has already started fundraising to help the victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.
Billionaire Elon Musk terminates as chairman of Tesla's board of directors. He fines $20 million for tweets.
Elon Musk, founder of space rockets and electric cars, avoids charges of fraud on a contract with the US Securities Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk terminates his duties as chairman of the board of the electric car company Tesla and agrees to a fine of $20 million.
Musk is giving up as part of the deal he entered into with the US Securities Market Supervisor.
By agreeing, Musk avoids charges of fraud.
The US Securities Commission, the SEC, threatened Musk with securities fraud because of the tweets he sent in August.
In them, Musk wrote that he was preparing to withdraw the electric car company Tesla from the stock exchange, which led to a rapid rise in the company's stock price.
According to the agreement, Musk is not allowed to chair Tesla's board for three years.
In addition, Tesla will have to appoint a new “independent member” to its board and take two “independent leaders” into its management team.
Tesla must also set up a committee to monitor Musk's communications.
Musk will still be CEO of Tesla.
In addition to Musk's personal fines of $20 million, Tesla Company also has to pay the corresponding fines of 20 million to the financial supervisor.
The tweets misled investors
According to the SEC, Musk's tweets misled investors and Tesla shareholders.
Musk claimed that he would have secured funding to buy Tesla back from the stock exchange as a private limited liability company.
According to billionaire tweets, the company would have been bought off the stock exchange for a share price of $420.
After tweets, Tesla's share price rose by more than 10% in a day, but then fell later.
According to the SEC, Musk's claims had no basis whatsoever.
According to the supervisor, he had not actually negotiated the funding he claimed.
Nor had he discussed the withdrawal from the stock exchange with the other management team or the company's board of directors.
On Friday this week, the exchange rate dropped 14 percent when securities overseer SEC reported a fraud charge.
The news of the agreement is expected to strengthen the company's course again.
The last verdict is not the reason
Of course, the cathedral bells don't ring when the hands don't move.
This is a technical failure.
The clock in the tower of Helsinki Cathedral has stopped.
The hands point at twelve o'clock.
The situation is like a mediocre horror film: while the church crypt was exorcism and the organ was playing on its own.
Of course this is not the case, but the clock has stopped for a technical reason: it has broken.
It has been visited by a repairman, but some part has broken down and a new part is expected,” says Snow Eveliina Jamsen.
At the same time, Jamsen confirms the fact that the Twitter account has already mentioned.
Indeed, the account mentions that the last judgment is not a reason for the clock to stop.
Jamsen tells me that church bells don't ring because of a fault.
