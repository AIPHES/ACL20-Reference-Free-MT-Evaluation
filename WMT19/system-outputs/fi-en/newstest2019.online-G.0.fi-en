The republican party, many hope that Kavanaugh's crucial votes can be overturned Roe v. Wade -known decision, which made U.S. abortion legal in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie sundberg's documentary film Reversing Roe - the united states and abortion rights tells you how the current situation has over the years to come.

A powerful documentary from the beginning to meet the gynecologist Colleen McNicholas, which is the law of blackmail as a result of been left as the only abortion by a doctor in the state of Missouri.

And so did Donald Trump.
To the heart of the matter, the document reaches as it seeks the basis for the politicisation of the abortion issue.
When apartheid in favour of involving religious organizations were denied tax exemption, they became politically active.

Teemu Pukki get a penalty - could not get himself to shoot
It looks like Wigan's top dog, Chey Dunkley, knocked him down with a tackle from behind in the penalty zone.
Referee Gavin Ward let the game continue.
His interpretation of the tackle was clean.
Teemu Santa couldn't believe his eyes.
The situation I think I left my effort to referee Ward, who condemned the Norwichille penalty 85. minute, when Santa was poured.
Ward looked like the penalty spot, and Mario Vrancic punched 1-0-winning goal.

However, these are promised to be released in the autumn.
Against children sexual preferences cause many to shame.
Most of the pedophile-feelings itself huomaavina not have taken the fantasy and thus doesn't do anything criminal.
Preference is, however, usually a permanent feature.
Most of them I hope he can get rid of those thoughts, that haunt and depress them.
They also complicate the task of a normal life, said Yle sexual therapist Patricia Thesleff, who works as an expert to the project.
In my opinion, the work is valuable, if even one child saved from sexual violence, Thesleff said.
Inter-Korean leaders or congolese gynecologist?
Us president, Donald Trump Nobel peace prize winner - the idea might sound at first glance strange, but Trump is betting odds on the basis of one of the biggest favorites of the prize.
In the background is Trump's role in North korea in at least the speech at the level of commitment to nuclear disarmament.
The biggest favorite of the peace Nobel prize entries are coefficients on the basis of the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who have this year met three times already and promised to work towards peace agreement between their two countries.
Between the two koreas warming is significant, because last year it was glacial.
Still in nuclear weapons uhitelleen and their country with an iron fist leading to kim's rewarding undoubtedly would raise a also criticism.
The Nobel awards will be announced starting Monday, and Friday is the turn of most attention get the peace prize.
If the prize is not given to the Korean peninsula, the diplomacy involved, is one of the top candidates for the congolese doctor Denis Mukwege.
A respected gynecologist has treatment a hospital of the democratic republic of Congo thousands of mass rape victims of women and risen in his field as a leading expert in the world.
Mukwege's work draws attention to sexual violence, which is of many conflicts creepy by-products.
A strong candidate has been considered also the UN refugee agency, which won the Nobel peace prize in 1954 and 1981.
The Nobel committee has told that this year the prize is 331 candidates.
The names of the candidates will not be made public.
Trump himself wouldn't mind a Nobel Prize.
In may, a reporter asked him at the White house, does he deserve that peace prize.
All are of the opinion, but I would never say it, Trump said with a smile.
I want to finish this.
The prize, which I want, is to win the whole world, the president continued, referring to the North Korea negotiations.
However, the aspects that make Trump's Nobel unlikely.
Prize of the Norwegian Nobel committee has often paid tribute to individuals and organizations, representing liberal democracy and a multipolar world order - precisely the kind of international cooperation by the opponent Trump has to see.
In the 2000s the prize has received three american politicians, all of which have been democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007 and Barack Obama in 2009.
Trump rewards require so, the Nobel committee's ideological volte-face.
The fire in the tunnel: Motorists behaved like lemmings and drove in the wrong direction
The traffic chaos on Route 1 happened on Route 8. September.
Tunnel traffic in the area was cut off notice for the sake of both Turku and Helsinki in the direction.
When we found out it was a system failure, the fire department tried to get traffic back to normal.
But it didn't work very quickly.
We tried to open the road already once before, but the road center said that it can not be opened, because the road is to motorists in a mess and they are driving, the on duty fire chief Pasi Kääriäinen tell at the time, fresh out of STT.
The highway was at that time run up the wrong way in just a moment after waiting.
When I first started to work against the traffic rules, a few other often follows suit, road safety liaison manager Tapio Heiskanen will be amazed.
Traffic rules on the highway and in the tunnels, not stopping as an overriding reason.
Road safety recalls that in exceptional circumstances, can not go to risk of traffic by means of hurried solutions.
Emergency vehicles must always be given as far as possible unhindered passage.
In the opposite direction driving on the freeway is especially forbidden, as well as a u-turn as well as withdrawal.
The same prohibitions are in force also in the tunnels, which in addition is always be connected to the headlights on.
Also, stopping without a compelling reason is forbidden, as of course also a parking.
Recently there have been even cases where the driver is stopped in the tunnel brush to lumia car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for such action, Heiskanen said the traffic safety bulletin.

From hämeenlinna to Tampere on the way to be M/S Tampere drifted late on Saturday night off course and missed keulastaan stick to the bottom of lake vanajavesi, Akaassa.
The ship ride had 19 passengers and five crew members were evacuated at night to the mainland.
No one was hurt in Haver.
Wildcat fans would have liked to continue the party on the boat until morning, but of course it was more sensible to send them to the fire department to ride to the port and take the bus home, Remote said to STT.
Lynx fans had been in Hämeenlinna watching Ilves and HPK:n match, which ended with the Lynx 4-3 victory.
Edge, according to Saturday's accident was due to the fact that the water surface of lake vanajavesi was about half a meter lower than normal.
Navigation was complicated by the Edge it is also the fact that the nearest bus sign was a log of feces-covered, which is why the reflectors are not visible normally in the dark September night.
No more significant impact.
The accident happened in a narrow Jumusensalmen the west side a little after the ferry route had fallen below the Tampere and Helsinki between the motorway bridge.
Greater drama in the case no Edge lettering, according to the associated, because the speed of the vessel was at the time very low and the bottom of the hit the caused mentioned more impact.
Edge according to the bottom of the entrapment is not caused the ship to leak or affected and marked, and of these the most prominent ship cruises will continue normally.
The diver went on a Saturday morning to check the ship's condition before the ship began to be towed off the shoal.
Just to be safe, we'll go back to the yard and check that there was no damage done.

Mr. Trump's potential candidate for Judge for harassment and drunkenness could be cut off from top position.
The united states supreme court justice presented Brett Kavanaugh may well remain devoid of target posts, the evaluation of the programme director Mika Aaltola foreign policy institute.
To date, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh'ta for sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior in college.
Aaltola, doubts have brought the republican party so much political pressure that president Donald Trump may end up to submit a post for someone else person.
The united states has occasionally in the past occurred, that the presidential candidate supreme court judge has sparked plenty of controversy.
In this case, the nominee has usually withdrawn himself, according to Aaltola.
This is how the president has managed to keep his face.
It would rain down on the Democrats
The u.s. supreme court strives to be above politics, but at least in Kavanaugh's case, the new judge selection has become a politically very sensitive process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, the decision of the hundred aaltola, according to the likely democratic party bins of congress in the upcoming midterm election.
It would raise the voting enthusiasm among young people and women, who vote more likely to be democrats.
On the other hand, the conservative judge's nomination to the supreme court would be the republicans the long term victory.
The opportunity designation does not hit every presidential term, the united states supreme court judges are appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have opted out of his own request to retire around 70-80 years of age.
Even some Republicans have hesitated to be named.
The united states supreme court judge candidates to do a normal background check, Aaltola said.
Although Trump has told the FBI an additional explanation for the only week period, it can still Aaltola, to bring out something essential.
It might.
Rarely is smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
Aaltola, it is certain at least that Kavanaugh's suitability or unsuitability to the post are still being discussed in a lively manner before the senate makes a decision.
Republicans have the senate majority by a vote of 51-49, but at least two female republican senators are thought to relate to Kavanaugh's nomination in doubt.
The most embarrassing would be that the nomination would be taken to the vote and republicans would disappear.

The mature stage of growth a company needs a leader who knows the numbers.
These learn to Nordic Business forum in listen 7 500 visitors - mainly Finnish leaders.
They were in danger of receiving information.
A good leader takes a lot.
That is why management often goes wrong, even at the highest level.
There were also Siilasmaa, and Ollila.
They talk to each other behind the scenes camaraderie.
But I don't think they were wondering if they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And it wasn't easy for an outsider to judge their humiliation.

Radio host Erkki knobhead, 83, is dead.
He died of incurable liver cancer, which tell Facebook on their website in march 2018.
Here we go.
The doctor I have said, live one day at a time, he commented on the situation in the evening paper about a month ago.
The safety of aunts and uncles in the store must be guaranteed.
I got paid for the first newspaper article in 1984.
When these years a ring on someone's story, get amazed, is it usually big news.
When I write (Karjalainen, 27.9.) retail workers ' insecurity, I was amazed and at times even a little angry.
I talked to the case also of Service trade union (PAM) a working environment specialist Erika Kähärää.
He says the crime statistics don't tell us what's really going on.
The problem is growing, while employers, of course, claim otherwise.
The police went only in clearly serious pilot cases and many real violent situations go unreported.
"Companies have of course a duty to keep statistics of near-situation of occupational safety and health on the basis of but these statistics remain for internal use and data to collect anything," he said.
Mental injuries don't end in statistics.
Violence situations has always been the problem, that they do not always arise from physical injuries.
Psychological trauma can be in spite of this, a lot more serious than bruises and wounds.
The difference between the violence of the situation and the threat of violence the situation between the two is hard to pull, when a certain level of aggressive uhkailukin is calculated as violence - even though the physical stuff was not.
Too many people are afraid of what they do at work, even if the real thing doesn't happen.
Some residential areas are restless.
The store has got security.
Shop opening hours liberalisation, it was the media in view of the rough you up pretty high it effects sellers of the security.
"At the time, many employers arranged security guard services at least for night-time hours and alone working to prevent", Curled in the comments.
When nothing happens, the wrong conclusion is drawn.
This seems now to have been effective, but this produces a new negative trend.
When the guard due to interference, the situation remained well in hand, the impression that guarding would be unnecessary.
Now in many places trying to find solutions, which can be expensive guard services to remove.
Petty assault is a complainant offence, and it is quite understandable that ill-treatment had seller want to make a request for investigation to the criminal, who usually lives in the shop nearby.
But, at the same, the 2011 law enacted by the mild abuse turns into a public prosecutor, if it happens in the workplace.
I think we need precedents.
The next time you shop aunt or uncle abused, should the police investigate and the prosecution of the accused.
When the law put a few of the abuser's prison, and the judgment there of punishment scale hard to get, so way to freshen up would be.
A society where food stores should be a little place kunnillakin open almost day and night, to keep the guarantee of trade safety for employees.

Niemi-Laine says workers lack also appears in the beginning of the year, when JHL's members were overtime and shift change prohibition in the contract negotiations.
Employers have made flexible through it possible, that staff have not been hired, but the employees are left to work overtime or change their shifts.
This is not yet an industrial action.

JHL resist the action of the government intention to reduce the burden of small businesses protection against dismissal.
Local government employers labour market director Markku Jalonen does not take pre-estimate of overtime - and shift the ban of the effects.
He does not believe, however, that they are very radical, although the services may be impaired.
Employers around the country are aware of this and made those preparations, what is to be done.
The area is so impossibly broad, social - and health sector and technical sector, that's hard to say.
The effects can vary very much by industry, region and employer, Jalonen said STT.
Jalonen said that last week there were already experiences including middle and primary care association Super and the social and health sector trade unions Tehy corresponding, three days lasting action.
Their effects were rather limited.
JHL:no overtime and shift change prohibition applies, inter alia, municipal, church, state, and private social and health care workers.
For example, family day care providers are excluded.
Industrial concerns at this stage almost 100 000 JHL's members.
Niemi law states that JHL's activities may last for a long time.
The federation has prepared also other industrial action, if the notice of the law preparation continues.
The government should now admit that this ran into the wall and hard.
The resolution also calls on the commission and the member states to take the necessary measures to ensure that the EU does not lose sight of the situation.
It is peculiar that the hard is already in the barrel, even though the show has not yet been issued, Jalonen update.

The other spaces collective Large coral Reefs premiered last spring in Hamburg and last Saturday it was presented for the second time in Finland, this time dullea in the house.
A group of earlier works, way the Great coral Reef is the work, which will be built at the beginning of the end together with the audience.
This time, however, the structure is also more clear-cut presentation, which refreshes and sums up the beginning of the exercises the findings.
Theater play enough of the fairy-tale magic also child participants.
The child's point of view has already been taken into account in the preparation of the work.
Large coral Reefs is still not a children's show but a show that adults and children make the connection.
It gives adults the knowledge and observations of children to take the knowledge and make art.
Children's ability to threw himself into the exercises and common games also distinct between adults and children distance.
A large coral Reef looks like some fairy-tale ballet, circuit and nature of information attacks, but finally it tunes in a different, non-human circumstances of roaming around.
A large coral Reef top corals as well as coral reef dwelling organisms and fish trajectories.
Six different circuit in the learn, inter alia, a manta ray and a sea horse gestures.

In addition, there are organisms that look at corals.
Many of the in the direction of address the eyes and observations do show a dense and teeming with life.
Ah, to be an organism in the landscape, the landscape of viewing organisms as well as organisms from viewing another organisms or landscapes - and all this at the same time.
It doesn't seem so hard for the kids.
Other spaces -group aims at thinking and action limits, which shut of when the group consists of both children and adults, is challenging.
On the other hand, the involvement of children makes it more important.
After the workshop the zither market staged a silent demonstration of endangered coral.
Human understanding beyond the devastation of not be cured, although it could be difficult to understand what the importance of your own compassion exercise no longer destroy the visions in front of is.
Other spaces has built works so that it respects the diversity of life is also a political gesture.
There are other generations, there is another kind of consciousness, other species and future generations, with wonder invest and play with it clearing space.
Kids grow up too fast - I'm happy that my childhood wasn't to smart phones
Children and young people today are becoming increasingly irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking all the time younger and younger age.
In my opinion children should be children their whole childhood period, and not to mess up their lives with drug and sex because everyone else says they do so.
I was taken aback when my friend told me that there was a need pick in the fifth grade to be a sister weekend "boyfriend".
When he came to get drunk of a sister, this tells the sexual experiences of that night.
I couldn't possibly imagine my own sister in the same situation, because we have been told and warned our whole childhood period of time that the drug is not to be touched and sex is an adult thing.
I hope that today's children would be able to live a decent childhood, and they wouldn't have to grow up too early friends created by group pressure.
I see constantly on instagram in increasingly younger girls, who are in the image of its face on and reveal clothes.
Snapchatia is used in the evenings to reveal the picture taking and sending.
Girls make it harder to guess how old they are.
Contemporary 13-year-olds can easily look 18 years old and older.
My childhood consisted of in the woods playing and a board game to play.
I'm glad I didn't have smartphones when I was a kid.
I got to be a child many, many years, and didn't need to think about what others think of me.

Video: dream goal to save liverpool's losses this series
Liverpool's one hundred per cent premier league start come to an end, but it was still happier with the team to 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge.
Sunday will mark exactly one year from when Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and escaped with a 1-0 away win.
That's when Pep Guardiola's combination sent the entire Premier League a signal that City was serious now.
Everyone remembers how last season ended.
And surely the Liverpool manager Jûrgen Klopp arrived at the same idea in West London.
Red had started the premier league with six consecutive wins.
Liverpool started the stronger and, in particular Virgil van Dijk seems to be alone in their own end of the field.
Chelsea, on the other hand, had Wednesday's great League Cup guest victory on Anfield Road.
That's when Eden Hazard rose to the bench to solve the match with a stunning individual performance.
And now, of course, Hazard was on board right from the start.
25. the minute he passing first a small space in the triangle game Mateo Kovacicin and Jorginho.
Eventually, the croat saw Hazard plunge ahead and sent this perfectly weighted through pass.
Hazard drifted a bit in the penalty area to the side, but the bombing there on the perfect left leg bets the rear-bottom corner.
Alisson, the brass guard at the pool, was a little slow in his fight, and all he got was his fingertips on the ball.
Klopp certainly feel the loss of the station lightly unfair, because almost immediately after Antonio Rüdiger clean sweep of Mo Salah to control the finish line.
And in the second episode, Chelsea's goalie Kepa got in the game.
Basque watch to react quickly Sadio Manén breath and pushed the ball to the post roots for a corner.
On the other side, Alisson threw himself into the Hazard Drive.
Guests of the best place to come to 72. minute, when James Milner found the average through no Bobby Firminon.
But the brass star's bumper was directed toward his national team, David Luiz, who saved the Masters ' leadership.
Even that couldn't take it anymore 89. minute, when substitute Daniel Sturridge got free to shoot 25 meters.
Sturridge played at the old home stadium, and the striker bombed it in honor of irresistible bets corner.
Liverpool's one hundred percent league start come to an end in a 1-1-draw, but it is still a league at the forefront - along with Manchester City.
Chelsea is also very much in the Championship two points behind the lead.
In the clock-changing conversation, the foxholes are deep.
I remember when a few decades ago, a magazine asked a variety of Finnish effects from, what share of the Finnish people.
The only thing that stuck in my head was Juice The Widow's answer.
Some people have a Nen terminal and some people don't.
The dividing line beams can be born anywhere, and this was one of the aspirant.
Finland has received EU at the time that the annual clock shifting being abandoned.
Very many will agree that the clock of the moving twice a year has been fool's work and caused a variety of problems.
In the end, this achievement seems, at least in Finland to be a solution for the easiest step, although it is easy to have been.
The hardest part is now solved, what time to eventually end up: the current summer - or winter time or any other time zone.
This is also the people say their opinions otakantaa.en-page.
The query is opened the ministry of transport and communications, and it is open Friday 12. October.
Debate fiercely the coffee table and on social media, and everyone has something to say.
Winter time defenders justify their positions with the morning light of the impact on human well-being and daylight saving time defenders of the night light by the impact of people walking to and through welfare.
Each position has solid supporters and good arguments.
Even research has shown that the morning light is a rhythm to the Human day and a refreshment.
On the other hand, if not in particular suffer from waking up in the dark, add light to the movement of people outdoors and provide better opportunities for example, the autumn yard work.
The additional light after a normal working day has already been counted to one hour.
I'd rather have both, but unfortunately, our position in the north of the Earth is beyond our control.
The winters are too dark and the summers for many, too bright in any case.
A typical subject for discussion is that your vision of the driven and the other view of the resistance very sharply.
Opposing arguments not just to listen, because the most important thing is what you feel.
Because almost all opinion, it is somewhat futile to attempt to turn to the second head.
It's a waste of gunpowder.
The subject is awfully easy to argue, because it does not require great dedication and justifying enough gut feeling.
A similar type of issue is disputed is usually the strongest terms and as the fruit now.
Annoys me that, if the wrong option is selected, but I think that too adjust.
And always it also provides a suitable scapegoat, if life seems a little down.

# Now we're going to the wrong place # # you don't know whether to cry or laugh # 
Last Saturday, a Karelian reported a bill to amend the Animal Welfare Act.
From the article I got the impression that the draft law in principle prohibits the production of animals, as pets or otherwise business related to all kind of animal the keeping of which is not specifically allowed in ministerial regulations.
In principle, therefore, all animals other than those specified in the regulation are prohibited.
If the bill becomes a law, must mean that we are abandoning the western democracies general principle that the law separately prohibits activities that endanger social safety or good manners.
Now we are setting out a priori all such action denial, which law or regulation is specifically authorized to enter.
Change means that nothing new can try for example in business and not do anything else before it adopted a law or regulation has been adopted.
Government business law preparation in general has been weak.
Now, if we go down that road, that, in principle, in Finland everything is forbidden what is not explicitly allowed, you wouldn't know whether to laugh or cry.
I have no doubt that the Animal Welfare Act requires an update.
But a legislative project along these lines is not part of democracy.
I don't know, unfortunately, the constitution very well, but I wonder if it accept this kind of "everything is forbidden, what no law or regulation specifically allows" the procedure.
I hope you find someone sensible minister, suspend such laws as the project progresses.

But how many 10-year-old is?
Identity card is a paid, and the bank ids of 10-year-old not even get.
Elementary school fourth grader information will not get in practice, therefore, to see no one else than by asking them to print.
