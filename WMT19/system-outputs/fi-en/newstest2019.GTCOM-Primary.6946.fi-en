Eemeli Kouki led the hurricane to a home victory in the opening - Savo Volley's second victory
Hurrikaani-Loimaa, who has been on men's volleyball Champions League medals as many as seven times in a row, started the 2018-19 season with a home win when Raision Loimu fell 3-0 on Saturday.
Eemeli Kouki, a general player who returned to Finland from Romania, was the most effective of the hurricane with 22 points.
There were some tunes abroad, but they didn't happen, and then there was a call from Loimaa.
Pretty quickly we got things agreed, "Kouki said.
Tomi Rumpunen, who played like Kouk in Loimu, supported Kouk with 18 points.
The most effective of the guests was Samuli Kaislasalo, a national team champ playing on a match-by-match contract, with 17 points.
Winning the opening game is always important.
Many players had experience from the other side as well, and that brought extra extras to the game.
Our game is not ready yet, but continuing the medal streak is, of course, the goal, "Kouki said.
Määttänen Savo Volley's most powerful
Miro Määttänen was the most powerful in Savo Volley with 18 points as the team beat the Vantaa Ducks 3-0 at Vieremä.
Our game was erratic, especially at the offensive end, but luckily we were able to squeeze out the victory.
I had at least no conscious different charge when I played against my former team, "Määttänen said.
Antti Siltala, who started his career in Vieremä volleyball in the 3-series in 2000-01, scored 12 points.
Head coach Jukka Tuovinen was pleased with many things.
The hall was small, that is, the atmosphere on the roof all the time.
The good feeling was missed by the home opener.
Miro was a kunkku, even then he played a good game, "Tuovinen said.
Siltala's previous season in the league was 2006-07, when he won silver at Pielavesi Sammo when Tuovinen was head coach even then.
Thiago Maciel was the Ducks' most powerful with 14 points.
Mikkonen again Akaa-Volley's star
Joni Mikkonen, who won the league standings in 2012-13, has started this season strongly as well.
The chipper scored 25 points as Akaa-Volley took his opening win of the season after knocking down the Kokkola Tigers 3-2.
The season has started quite well for itself.
Today, of course, we were close to defeat, as we were 17-21 in the fourth period.
A batch victory was dug from somewhere, and the fifth installment came in at the same time, "Mikkonen said.
The most powerful of the Tigers, who were still in the finals a few seasons ago, was the chipper Edvarts Buivids, who scored 28 points.
Compatriot Aleksandrs Kudryashovs supported by 17 points.
There was almost no grip on a friend's chipper, Mikkonen praised.
Finland ranks number one in the world in the comparison of human capital
Finland is a world leader in the comparison of human capital, says the scientific journal Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years Finland was number one in the statistics.
In 2016, the top five was almost the same as in 1990.
Previously, Finland was followed by Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Later, the Netherlands finished one higher and instead of Canada, Taiwan was found on the list.
In 2016, Niger and South Sudan ranked worst in comparison.
Human capital is measured by the level of education, access to education, skills and health of the population.
The World Bank has indicated that human capital is linked to economic growth.
Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois kept Atletico in check, local game ended without a goal
Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois stretched to glory fights, and the local game for the Madrid teams ended in a goal-free draw late on Saturday in the Spanish Football League.
From Atletico Madrid, Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were closest to the goal, but Belgian keeper Courtois had time to fight.
Courtois played in Atletico for three seasons on loan when he was a Chelsea player.
Early in the week he was selected as goalkeeper of the year by the International Football Federation (Fifa).
In Real, Gareth Bale got the best finish, but his shot was headed past the goal at the end of the opening half.
Bale was left in exchange after the break due to a thigh injury.
According to ESPN, disappointed Real supporters shouted the name of Cristiano Ronaldo, the goaltender who moved to Juventus in the match.
The US is now attacking the right to abortion - a powerful documentary explains why
The US Senate is currently trying to determine whether Brett Kavanaugh, the nominee nominated by President Donald Trump, could be elected as one of the nine members of the Supreme Court.
In the Republican Party, many hope that Kavanaugh's decisive vote will overturn the decision known as Roe v. Wade, which made abortion legal in the U.S. in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's documentary Reversing Roe - The United States and abortion rights tells us how the current situation has come about over the years.
Incredible as it may seem, the subject is also topical in Finland.
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (sin) has done publicity work against safe abortion and has received varying degrees of support for it from the majority of MPs in our country.
At the beginning of the powerful documentary, the gynaecologist Colleen McNicholas, who has remained the only doctor to perform abortions in the state of Missouri due to tightening laws, will be met.
An armed guard at the clinic says he defends religious freedom in the US.
News videos are reminiscent of deadly terrorist attacks on clinics.
Let's move to a time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At the time, a consortium of Lutheran churchgoers guided women to reliable abortion doctors.
The arguments of the pastor interviewed are good, but actually they are not even needed, a photograph of a woman who died from a self-abortion is enough.
There were about 5,000 deaths per year in the US.
The Republican Party, in particular, defended the legalization of abortions.
Back in 1967, in California, the abortion rights law was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan.
Later, it was Reagan, in his presidential campaign in 1980, who began to revolutionarily confuse religion with politics in order to sway voters.
His position on the Abortion was also reversed by his successor, George Bush senior.
And the same thing was done by Donald Trump.
To the heart of the matter, the documentary reaches in search of a basis for politicising the issue of abortion.
When religious organisations in favour of apartheid were denied tax exemption, they became politically active.
Abortion was chosen as the hobbyhorse.
Religion has brought extraordinary knots to politics.
At the time of writing, there is a situation in the USA where the President, who boasted of his sexual harassment but snatched the voices of the religious right with his abortion stance, has chosen Kavanaugh, who is now accused by several women of sexual harassment, as a candidate for the Supreme Court.
Kavanaugh can have the power, based on balance-language status, to decide on the rights of 164 million American women and girls.
Seven Palestinians were shot by the Israeli army, including two children - large demonstrations at the border
Nearly 200 Palestinians have been killed in six months as Israel has fired on demonstrators in the border zone.
On Friday, Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians in the Gaza border zone, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.
Two children are among the dead, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry: Boys aged 12 and 14.
According to the ministry, 505 people have been wounded.
Of these, 89 were wounded by bullets.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened fire and carried out an air strike on the border zone as demonstrators threw Israeli troops with stones and explosives.
The army says it has begun using force so that demonstrators do not break up the border fence or seek to reach the other side of it.
At least 191 Palestinians have died during demonstrations in Gaza since March, when Palestinians began weekly demonstrations at the border.
There are 12 000 wounded, according to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.
The demonstrators demanded access for Palestinian families to areas from which Palestinians were forced to leave when the State of Israel was founded in 1948.
One Israeli soldier has been killed by a Palestinian sniper.
Explosives dropped with kites and helium balls sent from the Palestinian side have ignited forest areas and farmland in Israel.
Teemu Pukki acquired a penalty kick - couldn't shoot himself
Wigan's topper Chey Dunkley appeared to have brought him down with a tackle from behind in the penalty area.
Referee Gavin Ward allowed the game to continue.
According to his interpretation, the rigging was clean.
Teemu Pukki could not believe his eyes.
I think the situation was going to be plagued by referee Ward, who sentenced Norwich to a penalty kick in the 85th minute when Pukki was brought down.
Ward looked like a penalty spot, and Mario Vrancic shook off a 1-0 winning goal.
Santa has scored five goals for Norwich in the championship.
The previous one was born last Saturday against QPR in style with a chest muscle.
The work tasted like Puk again.
After losing the ball, he continued until the end of the situation.
He created goal situations and defended tirelessly.
For Norwich, the match was the fifth in two weeks.
The team continues in the League Cup.
Behind it is a five-win streak.
Paedophile assistance service was immediately filled with bookings - around 40,000 people in Finland experience interest in children
It is estimated that two per cent of men and a small proportion of women experience at least some sexual interest in pre-teens.
In Finland, this means around 40 000 people.
Until now, those who are sexually interested in children or young people have found it difficult to get help.
A joint SERIE project between the Criminal Care Foundation and Sexpo will train professionals to meet paedophiles as customers, as well as help people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was announced in the spring, an email flood began in Sexpo, which offers counselling and therapy, and appointment times were very quickly booked out, Yle says.
However, these are promised to be released during the autumn.
Many people are ashamed of their sexual preference for children.
Most of those who notice pedophilic feelings in themselves have not carried out their fantasies and thus done nothing criminal.
However, preference is usually a permanent feature.
Most of them hope to get rid of the ideas that haunt and depress them.
They also complicate normal life, says Patricia Thesleff, a general sexual therapist who works as a specialist in the project.
In my opinion, work is valuable if even one child is spared sexual violence, "Thesleff says.
Korean leaders or a Congolese gynaecologist?
Us President Donald Trump as the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize - an idea that may suddenly sound strange, but Trump is one of the biggest favorites for the prize, based on betting odds.
The background is Trump's role in getting North Korea, at least at speech level, to commit to nuclear disarmament.
The biggest favorites for the Nobel Peace Prize are, based on the odds, South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who have already met three times this year and pledged to seek a peace agreement between their countries.
The warming between the two Koreas is remarkable, with good relations as recently as last year.
Yet rewarding Kim, who has spent years swimming with nuclear weapons and leading his country with an iron grip, would undoubtedly also provoke criticism.
The Nobel Prize winners will be announced from Monday, and Friday will be the most prominent, the Peace Prize.
If the prize is not given to those involved in diplomacy on the Korean peninsula, one of the top candidates will be Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege.
A respected gynaecologist has treated thousands of women who have been victims of gang rape in his hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has become a leading expert in his field in the world.
Through his work, Mukwege has drawn attention to sexual violence, a gruesome by-product of many conflicts.
The UN refugee organisation, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981, has also been seen as a strong candidate.
The Nobel Committee has reported that there are 331 nominees for the prize this year.
The names of the candidates are not made public.
Trump himself would not mind if he received the Nobel Prize.
In May, a journalist asked him at the White House if he thought he deserved a peace prize.
Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it myself, "Trump said with a smile.
I want to finish this.
The prize I want is a victory for the whole world, "the president continued, referring to the North Korea talks.
However, there are facts that make Trump's Nobel unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which decides on the award, has often paid tribute to individuals and organizations that represent liberal democracy and a multipolar world order - exactly the kind of international cooperation that Trump has been seen as an opponent of.
In the 21st century, the prize has been awarded to three US politicians, all of whom have been Democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007, and Barack Obama in 2009.
Rewarding Trump would therefore require an ideological U-turn from the Nobel Committee.
Fire report in the tunnel: Motorists behaved like lemmings and drove in the wrong direction
The traffic chaos on the first road in Lohja took place on 8 September.
Due to the announcement, traffic in the tunnel area was cut off towards both Turku and Helsinki.
When it became clear that this was a system failure, the fire service sought to bring traffic to normal.
However, it did not succeed very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Finnish Road Traffic Centre said it could not be opened because there are motorists on the road that shock as well and they drive as it happens, "on-call firefighter Pasi Kääriäinen told STT recently at the time.
At the time, the motorway was even driven in the wrong direction after just a moment of waiting.
When the first one starts working against the traffic rules, a few others often follow, "says Tapio Heiskanen, Traffic Safety Liaison Manager.
According to traffic rules, motorways and tunnels must not stop except for compelling reasons.
Traffic safety points out that, in exceptional circumstances, you cannot start to endanger traffic with hasty solutions.
Emergency vehicles shall always be provided with the most accessible access possible.
In particular, driving in the opposite direction on the motorway is prohibited, as is making a U-turn and reversing.
The same bans apply in tunnels where, in addition, headlights must always be switched on.
Stopping for no compelling reason is also prohibited, as is, of course, parking.
Recently, there have even been cases where a driver has stopped in a tunnel to brush snow from his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for this activity, "Heiskanen says in the Traffic Safety Bulletin.
Ilves fans would have liked to continue their celebrations even though the ship was caught at the bottom of the lake
Ilves fans transported by the inland water ship M / S Tampere would have liked to stay on board to continue their victory celebration, even though the ship had been caught in the bottom of the lake by its bow, "says Juho Syrjä, who was the ship's master at the time of the event.
M / S Tampere, which was travelling from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, drifted off its route late on Saturday evening and was caught in the bottom of its bow in Vanajavesi, Akaa.
The 19 passengers and five crew members aboard the vessel were evacuated to the mainland at night.
No one was injured in the haver.
Ilves fans would have liked to continue their celebrations on board until the morning, but of course it made more sense to send them on a fire service ride to the harbour and by bus home, "Syrjä said to STT.
Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna following the match between Ilves and HPK, which ended with a 4-3 victory for Ilves.
According to the aside, Saturday's haver was due to the water level in Vanajavesi being about half a metre lower than normal.
According to Syrjä, navigation was also hampered by the fact that the nearest fairway sign was covered with log droppings, which meant that its reflectors were not normally visible on the dark autumn bridge.
No more significant collision
Haveri took place on the west side of the narrow Jumusensalmi strait shortly after the shipping route had undercut the motorway bridge between Tampere and Helsinki.
There was no greater drama in the incident, according to Syrjä, as the speed of the vessel was very low at the time of the incident and the impact on the bottom did not cause a more significant collision.
According to the side, being stuck to the bottom has not caused any leaks or depressions on the ship and, in the foreseeable future, cruises on the ship will continue as normal.
The diver went to check the condition of the ship on Saturday morning before the ship began to be towed off the shoal.
As a precaution, we are still going to the shipyard to check that no damage was caused, "says Syrjä.
Syrjä believes that M / S Tampere's next cruise, which has been booked for next weekend, can be handled as agreed.
According to him, the cruise season of the vessel will continue until Independence Day.
No use for ambulances
Emergency services were alerted to the incident on Saturday evening just after half past twelve.
Ambulances were called to the port of Viiala to receive evacuated passengers, but there was no use for ambulances.
On-duty firefighter Matti Willman reported late in the evening that evacuation conditions on the lake were difficult due to darkness and fairly strong wind.
After half past three on Sunday night, the Pirkanmaa Rescue Department announced that all those on board had been evacuated and that passengers had been transferred by bus to Tampere.
Built in 1957, the cruiser has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
Trump's judicial nominee accused of harassment and drinking may miss top office
Brett Kavanaugh, who has been presented as a US Supreme Court judge, may well miss the post he is seeking, according to programme director Mika Aaltola of the Institute for Foreign Policy.
So far, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior during his student days.
According to Aaltola, the suspicions have put so much political pressure on the Republican Party that President Donald Trump can end up putting someone else in office.
From time to time in the United States, it has happened in the past that the President's nominee for Supreme Court Justice has sparked plenty of controversy.
In this case, the candidate for the judge has usually withdrawn himself, "says Aaltola.
This has allowed the president to keep his face.
The nomination would rain on Democrats' laurels
The US Supreme Court seeks to be above politics, but in the case of Kavanaugh at least, the election of a new judge has become a politically very sensitive process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, the decision is likely to rain on the Democratic Party's laurels in the upcoming midterm elections in Congress, according to Aaltola.
That would raise voter enthusiasm among young people and women, who would be more likely to vote for Democrats.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge to the Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for Republicans.
The opportunity to be appointed does not coincide with every presidential term, as Supreme Court judges in the United States are appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have retired at their own request at the age of around 70-80.
Even among Republicans, some are hesitant about the nomination
The candidates for the Supreme Court of the United States are normally the subject of a background report, "Aaltola says.
Although Trump has only set a one-week deadline for further FBI clearance, it can still bring up something essential, according to Aaltola.
Yes, it might bring.
There is rarely smoke without fire, "says Aaltola.
According to Aaltola, what is certain, at least, is that Kavanaugh's suitability or unsuitability for office will still be the subject of lively debate before the Senate makes its decision.
Republicans have a majority of 51 to 49 in the Senate, but at least two female Republican senators are thought to be sceptical about Kavanaugh's nomination.
The most embarrassing thing would be for the nomination to be put to the vote and for the Republicans to lose.
Woman identified Salisbury suspect as an agent of military intelligence
A Russian woman has told the broadcaster BBC that she identifies a Russian man suspected of the Salisbury poisonings as an agent of the Russian military intelligence service.
The woman told me, based on the photographs, that it was Anatoly Tshepiga, who works in the GRU for military intelligence.
The online community Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia previously said they had uncovered one of the men suspected of the poisonings as Tshepiga.
Even earlier, they said they had found evidence that the men's current identities were covert identities.
The BBC group travelled to the Far East to a village near the Russian-Chinese border, where Tshepiga grew up.
A woman living in the village recognised the young Tshepigan Bellingcat from the photos published.
He identified the same man from images of British police showing a man now calling himself Ruslan Boshirov.
Russian men are suspected of poisoning former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter with the Novitshok nerve agent in March.
The Skripals survived.
Colonel Tshepiga has been awarded with, among other things, the Order of the Hero of Russia in 2014.
Russia still denies the suspected GRU connection.
In an interview with Russian TV earlier in September, the men suspected of the poisonings said they had been tourists in Salisbury.
Elderly people as throwing bags in sote reform
There is now a vivid example of what the Sipilä government's definition of a limit to change in soda reform means in practice.
The social media services of Vaala, my municipality of birth, are produced by the Oulunkaari joint municipal authority, whose former regional director of Attendo has been elected as the director of health services in 2016.
The leaders of the joint municipal board warn the council of a restriction on change.
If soda spending now rises, the municipality's state aid will be cut in the future.
The central decision-makers in the municipality were frightened, and most of them are ready for a major structural change in care for the elderly, which would put an end to institutional care in the health centre's wards and a small unit for memory sufferers.
Home hospital care would be increased, which means that, over long distances in Vaala, elderly people living in remote villages will be uprooted next to a health centre to be treated "at home."
Attendo relied on the municipality to pay its customers.
The Left in Vaala did not swallow poor preparation, but organised a good public event with many relatives, local carers and also delegates from other parties.
I presented how the municipality of Vaala already cares for the elderly most at home in the whole of North Ostrobothnia.
Carina Läntinen, councillor of the neighbouring municipality, was also present.
The local newspaper made a big story about the occasion, and it again put Oulunkaari's draftsmen on their hind legs.
Sote draftsmen do not write in any papers that Attendo has built a new care home in Vaala, which is now waiting empty for residents.
There are no other service providers.
The draftsmen only talk about the voucher, but do not say what level of care it will provide or what kind of staff structure Attendo will provide for the elderly until hospice care.
Without a nurse?
In fact, the sites of the health centre are being closed down because there is no night duty for a doctor.
Attendo will also rely on doctors at the Vaala Health Centre.
The example of Vaala shows how centrist officials run councillors with incomplete information and councillors are pricked against the wall with a change limiter.
In this way, the Centre Party will clear Vaala of the inhabitants, as who will remain there unsafe to live voluntarily if there is an opportunity to move away.
Was there one electoral phrase in the centre that the whole country is kept inhabited?
Turkish President Erdogan Opens Grand Mosque in Cologne
In Germany, in the city of Cologne, thousands of people protested when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is visiting the country, opened one of the largest mosques in Europe.
Several hundred people had gathered on the banks of the Rhine River since the morning.
Erdogan you are not welcome, read on the demonstrators' signs, and the slogans condemned fascism.
Several demonstrations have taken place during Erdogan's visit, which began on Thursday, and security measures have been strict.
In Cologne, around 10 000 people were expected to take to the streets in advance to protest, including the human rights situation in Turkey.
Supporters of Erdogan had also gathered near the Grand Mosque.
However, police had isolated a large area around the mosque for security reasons.
In his opening speech, Erdogan praised his visit to Germany as a success and judged it to have strengthened relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdogan met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
On Friday, Erdogan and Merkel vowed to rebuild relations between the two countries, which have deteriorated significantly since Turkey's 2016 coup attempt.
However, Merkel stressed that there were deep differences between the two countries on issues such as human rights.
Review surrounds the visit
Both the Mayor of Cologne, Henriette Reker, and the Prime Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, Armin Laschet, withdrew their participation in the opening ceremony as criticism of Erdogan's visit intensified.
Cansu, a 30-year-old student from Turkey, said he had come to an anti-Erdogan demonstration in Switzerland.
I want to be a voice for those who cannot take to the streets in Turkey.
They have been arrested, killed and subjected.
For Erdogan, anything that differs from his own thinking is terrorism.
In the last leg of Erdogan's trip to Germany in North Rhine-Westphalia, a significant part of the population is of Turkish origin.
In Slovakia, three are charged with the murder of a journalist
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
The prosecutor reported on Friday that three people are charged with the February murder of Kuciak and his fiancée, as well as other crimes.
Earlier this week, eight people were arrested by police in an investigation into the murder, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak was found shot in February with his fiancée in his home in Bratislava.
He had studied the links between politicians and the Italian mafia.
Police have suspected the murders are related to Kuciak's inquiries.
The case and Kuciak's published article have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
There may be problems with the distribution of Karelians on Sunday in sparsely populated areas
Due to a printing failure, Sunday's Karjalainen will also have to be mailed unaddressed.
This may be reflected in the distribution of the magazine in sparsely populated areas, where distribution to common boxes has to be carried out from the outside memory.
The situation was the same for Saturday's newspaper, and the problem may continue on Monday.
Mailing puts extra leaf bouquets into the county.
The newspapers of subscribers in the rest of Finland will not be mailed separately until Monday.
There is a considerable delay in the distribution of these newspapers.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
Journalist Arto Nyberg will interview Vesa Heilala, among others, live on his upcoming talk show today.
Vesa is in the studio to talk about his upcoming space trip, which he booked from Virgin Galactica back in 2010.
The price was EUR 151 000, which required a bank loan to pay.
If the original plans had been true, Vesa would have been in space a long time ago.
However, the departure date has been postponed year on year.
It now appears that, after an unfortunate test flight in 2014, which also claimed a death, things are in a hole.
If all goes well, commercial flights will still start this year, or at the latest next year.
Vesa's flight number is 300, which means his trip is about a year away from the first departure.
The flight takes 2.5 hours and the weightless space is 5 minutes at 100 km, "the Finnish astronaut says on his upcoming homepage.
At the same address, he also backs up his longing for space.
As a child, I read a comic book called space travel and saw the Star Trek series on televisions.
The Star Wars have been seen and that's where the idea was left smouldering.
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a blunt host
Manchester City continued their undefeated run in the Premier League when they beat Brighton 2-0 on their home ground on Saturday.
Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero were the guarantors of the reigning champion team's sixth victory of the season.
Sterling was allowed to direct his fourth hit of the season from close range to an empty goal when Leroy Sané found him in the 30th minute of Brighton's goal from the takatoppa.
Agüero raised his own March balance to five when he sawed the Brighton defence to pieces with Sterling in the 65th minute of play.
The Argentine was able to place the 2-0 final figures at the penalty spot with ease.
City, who started the season with six wins and one draw, lead the Premier League with a 19-point catch.
However, Liverpool, who played one game less, lurk just one point away.
Liverpool will face series three Chelsea in their own seventh-round match on Saturday night.
Youth clubs selected new decision-makers in Joensuu
At their meeting, which ended on Sunday, Finnish youth clubs selected new decision-makers for their next three-year term from 2019 to 2021.
Anu Sivonen from Ylä-Savo was elected chairman and Petra Mäkeläinen from Häme was elected vice-president.
Forty full members and 40 alternates were elected to the council, Finnish youth clubs will announce on Sunday.
A youth society meeting was held in Joensuu.
We want our cultural activities to be known for their quality and safety.
The Youth Society meeting in Joensuu makes three promises in its three-year operational objectives: We keep the doors open for everyone, and we organise equal leisure activities regardless of place of residence and background, and we support voluntary activities and people on their own growth paths, "says the Finnish youth clubs in their press release.
Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Räikkö and amazed Ferrari: "Losing a very important driver"
In an interview with Swiss newspaper Blick, Mersu's British driver was asked if he believed that releasing Kimi Räikkönen from Ferrari's services would help Hamilton in the rest of the season.
Hamilton leads Ferrari's second driver Sebastian Vettel with 40 points in the World Cup standings.
Just under three weeks ago Ferrari told us that Räikkönen would not continue in the stable next season and at the same time Räikkönen announced that he would move to Sauber.
Of course, Hamilton doesn't think Räikkönen would hit the gloves on the counter.
I don't think Kimi will change in the remaining Games.
He's an exceptional professional - a fantastic driver.
He remains one of my favourite drivers and I am convinced that Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
For me, that does not make sense.
Hamilton has previously reported that Räikkönen has been one of his role models.
I don't know if Kimi knows this, but when I was young and dreamed of Formula One, I played F1 at PlayStation all day.
I was always Kimi, which is pretty crazy, "Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season continues on Sunday with the Russian event.
Valtteri Bottas of Mercedes will start the race from pole position at 14: 00.
The Evening Journal follows the race moment by moment.
Football's A-Youth Championship fight became a complete farce: The opponent arrived with only 7 players
The top tier of football boys will end on Saturday, when the final round of the season will be played.
From the point of view of the championship fight, which started before 1 p.m., the starting points were clear: For FC Lahti Academy, there is practically a point against Vasa IFK in first place.
In order to turn the situation around in the final round, Ilves, who is second in the championship battle, must win the PK-35 and hope for the Lahti defeat.
However, the Lahti Championship was confirmed in practice even before the start whistle, as Vasa IFK had arrived in Lahti with only seven players.
If there had been one less horizontal, the match could not have been started.
FC Lahti Academy won the match 16-0.
At the break, the Lahti people led 7-0.
One of the reasons for the division of the Vaasalainen players is that the team has played partly with the same players in the A-youth Finnish Championship series, i.e. the P20 series and the men's Kakkonen C-section.
Vasa IFK has played in second place virtually all season against relegation.
In the final round of the second round on Saturday, Vasa IFK will be forced to win JBK in a foreign match and at the same time hope that Tampere United will lose their own foreign match against KuFu in Toivala, Siilinjärvi.
The car ended up on its roof in Eno - according to the emergency services, luck was involved
The car drifted out of the road and ended up on its roof in Eno on Juttuvaarantie at 9am on Sunday.
Four people were involved in the accident.
Two of them were slightly injured, the emergency services report.
Good luck was involved, according to the press release.
According to the emergency services, the road was wet after the rain.
The police patrol visited the scene of the accident.
Supo expects new ways to inquire: Equipment purchases and recruitments already made, no sweeping of activities planned abroad
According to Antti Pelttari, Head of Supo, provision has been made for the Intelligence Act by purchasing equipment and training personnel.
With the entry into force of the intelligence laws, there would be a permanent increase in the budget of around EUR 10 million.
Preparations for the entry into force of the intelligence laws are already being made at the premises of the Protection Police (Supo) in Ratakatu, Helsinki.
Antti Pelttari, Supo's head of assembly, tells Western Media that equipment purchases have already been made for future intelligence powers.
Serena Williams is startled by a video in which she sings topless - campaigning for breast cancer awareness
Tennis superstar Serena Williams chuckles again.
She is now campaigning to raise awareness of breast cancer by posting a video on her Instagram account in which she sings solely with her hands in front of her breasts, according to AFP news agency.
The song is the 1991 hit I Touch Myself by The Divinyls of Australia.
In the video, Williams supports the Australian Breast Cancer Association's activities.
"I recorded The Divinyls" global hit to remind women to do regular self-help [breast] checks, "Williams writes in her Instagram message.
And yes, this put me in an area of discomfort, but I wanted to do it because the subject affects all women, regardless of skin colour, all over the world.
Early detection is everything a and o - it plays for many lives.
Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53, is the co-author of The Divinyls' song.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project, made in honour of Chrissy Amphlett.
"She passed away from breast cancer but gave us a hit song to remind women to put their health first," Williams says.
The video has now been viewed 1.5 million times.
It was released early Sunday morning.
In the comments in the video, Williams is praised for his courage.
Williams opted out of the Beijing tennis tournament earlier this week.
In the background, there is a fuss at the US open tennis tournament three weeks ago.
Williams came to the main referee of the match and, among other things, claimed that much more drastic behaviour is accepted from men than from female players.
Chinese restaurant on mountain path not suitable for high-rise people
In addition to traditional Chinese delicacies, the restaurant serves stunning scenery.
An exceptional restaurant has been opened in China's Zhejiang province.
It is literally located on a cliff.
From there you can watch the forest spreading below if you wish.
Rugged landscapes at altitudes make restaurant visitors bark their breath in the Longquan Mountains.
Getting to the restaurant requires hiking among peach trees.
The restaurant opened to hikers on 19 September 2018.
YouTube comments wonder where the restaurant's toilet is located.
Hiking to the restaurant requires good ground condition, the place is told.
Korpela's alley run ends today: How it all ends
Everything good will come to an end in due course.
Today, that's what happens to the domestic country drama Korpela's alley run, which has been quite liked.
The third season has gone like hot stones: Last week, 722 000 Finns watched the episode on television as a first performance.
The top figures in themselves no longer have any practical significance, as there will be no continuation of Heikki Luoma's and Jukka Mäkinen's series.
In the final episode, Jaska and Mirku's relationship takes another big leap forward, and Jaska's mother seems to be the first to guess what's to come.
Anssi and Miisa are warm too, in the light of recent events downright romantic, but then Laiho appears in the patterns once again.
The police, too, are sceptical about the man on the slip.
Yet no one can foresee Laiho's fate in advance.
Anita, meanwhile, gets to hear some amazing news.
Kauko's last will comes out, which brings the woman to the brink of tears.
After a week on Sunday evenings continues with new episodes of Sorjonen.
Korpela's alley run today on TV1 at 21.05.
Is it worth going to work tomorrow with a little flu?
Here are the facts for and against
The flu season is hot.
Many people will guess if they stay at home or not.
However, you should consider whether you should go and infect others, as the disease can be contagious even if your own symptoms are small.
Sometimes flu symptoms strike suddenly, sometimes they appear in the creeps.
In the latter option, you may already infect others, even if your own symptoms seem small, according to the Prevention publication.
So is it worth staying at home?
According to Prevention, the flu is contagious even when the person themselves has no symptoms.
The virus is already transmitted the day before symptoms start and from then on from five days to a week.
Children may be infected with the disease for longer.
As soon as you recognise the symptoms, you should not be at school or at work.
You can return to work when the cough eases and there is no fever anymore, says Professor of Medicine Gregory Poland.
You should also avoid exercising.
Too quick a return to the hall slows down recovery.
In addition, remember to wash your hands, nip in the handkerchief and throw the ratchet papers in the bin.
Sore to move, though?
If you have to leave the home sick, consider wearing a protective mask.
The mask does not control the viruses, but keeps the user aware of the area of the head.
Then you won't put your fingers in your nose or mouth, "Poland says.
Sneezing is also limited to the mask.
So how can we avoid infection?
The best way is still to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
However, it is difficult to avoid the latter.
In the United States, for example, the average person touches their eyes, nose or mouth every 15 to 30 seconds, Poland warns.
New Miss Finland repeats mission tradition: "My husband is a hockey player"
The hockey player and the missions are often combined.
This was also the case with Alina Voronkova, 23.
Alina Voronkova, from Pertunmaa, has received the 2018 Miss Finland crown for her shrinks.
Kaunotar now lives in Lahti, where she moved at the age of 15.
Alina's mother is Ingrian and her father is Russian.
As for his father's Russians, Voronkova was bullied at school.
Mother and Father have moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was bullied for being Russian.
In Pertunmaa, I had no friends at all, "Alina says at the announcement of the semi-finalists for Miss Finland.
After secondary school, Alina decided to start from a clean table and move to Lahti to go to high school.
Soon the missionary found new friends and everyday life started to roll as hoped.
Then, at the age of 15, you think you're an adult, but when you think about it in retrospect, I really wasn't.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner, Joonas Hurr, who is familiar with the Pelicans' ranks.
After a career in the SM-liiga, the hockey player has played abroad, such as in Sweden and China.
In 2009 he was in the Finnish team at the 18-year-old World Cup.
In the early days of dating, the couple lived almost a year in a distant relationship, but later Alina was able to travel with her husband to the world.
If I could get into the trio of winners and, with it, have a career that would sway me, then I don't want to believe that it would affect our relationship in any way.
Even if we have to live apart, so we have confidence working well and the good thing about the remote relationship is that that initial spark stays over the whole time, "Alina sneaked in May.
Rejoicing at continued growth, death on our heels
Almost everyone is concerned about the planet's resilience.
Yet we do not want to give up much.
Sustainable alternatives to continued growth are being sought, but even the theory of a reasonable economy comes up against major problems.
Over a few generations, continued economic growth has brought ordinary people, especially in the northern hemisphere, a standard of living that could only be dreamed of in the past.
However, the long-term overrun of the earth's carrying capacity and climate change are causing this bedrock of the market economy to falter dangerously.
Two men were stabbed on Sunday night in Kannelmäki, Sitratori, at four in the morning.
A man born in 1986 was seriously injured in the stabbing and another, born in 1968, was less severely injured.
The older of the men has already left the hospital.
Police have apprehended one person whose possible contribution to the stabbing is being investigated.
Police are also looking for another suspect linked to the incidents.
The events are being investigated as attempted manslaughter and aggravated assault.
An important point for IFK Mariehamn - Inter's coach complained about the mistake
IFK Mariehamn's Simon Silverholt equaliser against Inter brought the team an important point in the men's football league on Saturday.
Silverholt finished the match that ended at 1-1 in the 78th minute.
Silvelholt got through the right wing and luckily lifted the ball over goalkeeper Henrik Moisander.
With the guest sabre, the Mariehamn people made up the difference to the Turun Palloseura, which is in the place of the serial carpenter, to two points.
An important goal and a valuable point, summed up by Mariehamn head coach Peter Lundberg.
Lundberg noted that the team did not, however, ignite the kind of battle he expected.
We made a lot of mistakes in the opening period, but luckily the Turks "goal brought us stronger into the game.
According to John Allen, head coach of the home team Inter, the game was in control, but scoring again caused pain.
One defensive error took us a full score, "Allen complained.
Again, we were the best!

Lehterä showed his underpower skills, the venue is not yet sure
Jori Lehterä's strong underpower play came to the fore when his NHL club, the Philadelphia Flyers, played their last practice match before the start of the season.
Philadelphia won Boston 4-1, and Lehterä fed Michael Rafflin twice to score.
In recent days, Lehterä has been on the agenda because of drug suspicions.
On Wednesday, MTV reported that Lehterä is one of 23 suspects in a drug spree where some are suspected of drug use and others are suspected of selling, for example.
Lehterä has denied committing a crime.
The club and player have discussed the subject, and the NHL is investigating the incident.
Sam Carchidi, a reporter for the Philadelphia Inquirer who closely follows the Flyers, estimated after the match that Lehterä belongs to a group of six attackers, five of whom will get a place on the NHL team.
In the practice match Lehterä was excellent, according to Carchid.
In the second period Lehterä fought the puck to himself on the penalty kill, pulled the defender against him and fed Raffl, who was waiting in front of the goal, into the open position.
For the second time, the duo's collaboration brought a goal right at the end of the match.
The Flyers begin the NHL season on October 4 with a guest match against Las Vegas.
In Boston, defenseman Urho Vaakanainen is waiting for the team's coaching management to decide whether to join the NHL group.
I think the training camp was good.
I did my best, and I can be proud of this.
Now the coaches will decide whether I get to play.
I believe I am ready for the NHL, "Vaakanainen said in an interview published on Boston's Twitter account.
Vaakanainen, who got his hockey lesson in Jokipojat, played 19.31 minutes against Philadelphia.
With Boston's goal, Tuukka Rask surrendered four times and turned down 20 times.
Kärpät-based defenseman Vili Saarijärvi scored a 1-0 goal for Detroit on a power play as the team toppled Toronto 5-1.
In Calgary's ranks Ilves was brought up, defender Juuso Välimäki got a pass point, but Edmonton defeated Calgary 4-3.
The Oilers rested Jesse Puljujärvi and goaltender Mikko Koski, among others.
Florida's Aleksander Barkov played just over 20 minutes and entered the goal in a local game against Tampa Bay.
Tampa won 3-2.
Columbus defenseman Markus Nutivaara entered his team's consolation goal midway through the final period as Chicago defeated Columbus 4-1.
On the losing goal, Joonas Korpisalo turned down 23 / 27 pucks.
Already over 180 000 responses to the time survey
Citizens have actively responded to the questionnaire on the decision on Finland's future time.
The question of whether Finland should apply winter or summer time permanently in the future has already attracted a good 180 000 answers.
The questionnaire opened in the Otakantaa.fi service will still have time to be answered for less than a couple of weeks.
Respondents are also asked whether Finland should be in the same period as the other Nordic countries, the Baltic States, Central Europe or Western Russia.
A recent photo shows a change: The world's strongest man lost tens of kilograms
Eddie Hall, crowned the world's strongest man in 2017, is undergoing a striking transformation.
British Eddie Hall hunted for the title of the world's strongest man for a long time and with determination.
Hall could eat up to 10,000 kilocalories of food a day and weighed 200 kilograms at its maximum, according to the Mirror.
Shirts were size 5XL.
Hall admitted before winning the title that he was doing damage to his body.
The human body is not created to be this size, Hall said.
The British hunted for victory in the world's strongest man race by all means and the man with a family promised to end his career if he got the title.
Hall did not want her children to grow up without a father.
Hall kept his promise and was no longer seen at the 2018 World's Strongest Man Games in April.
Recently, Hall released a photo on Instagram in which she poses in a much slimmer condition than her active career.
Hall writes that his current weight is 169.5 pounds.
Hall wrote that he now trains five times a week aerobically.
The programme includes activities such as boxing, cycling and swimming.
In addition, Hall does four workouts a week in the gym.
This year, the strongest man in the world was the Icelandic, also familiar from the Game of Thrones TV series, Hafkusór Júlíus Björnsson.
The previous Finnish winner of the competition is Janne Virtanen, who was number one in 2000.
Restaurant ship M / S Tampere rushed aground in Pyhäjärvi - "firmly stuck on a rock"
The inland water ship M / S Tampere ran aground late on Friday evening in Akaa, Pyhäjärvi.
Emergency services were alerted to the water traffic accident on Friday evening after half past twelve.
The 30-metre vessel M / S Tampere has run aground, and is firmly attached to its bow on a rock, "described on-duty firefighter Matti Willman.
There were 19 passengers and five crew members aboard the vessel.
According to the emergency services, personal injury was avoided.
Passengers and almost all crew members have been evacuated to the mainland from the ship.
Now they are being moved on a bus ride towards Tampere, "Jari Nieminen, head of duty, told STT after one o'clock at night.
Ambulances were called to the port of Viiala to receive evacuated passengers.
The ship, which had travelled from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, had for some reason drifted away from its route to the west of the narrow Jumusensalmi strait.
Police are investigating the cause of the incidents.
On-call firefighter Matti Willman said earlier in the evening that conditions on the lake were difficult due to darkness and fairly strong wind.
According to the emergency services, the fate of the vessel is unclear.
The ship is apparently not leaking.
After the evacuation operation, divers will start checking what the situation is there at the bottom.
Built in 1957, M / S Tampere is now an inland waterway vessel operating as a restaurant ship with a maximum number of passengers of 180.
The vessel also has a meeting room for private use.
According to the ship's website, the cruiser has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.

Ex-managers demand unpaid fees from Robert Helenius
Boxer Robert Helenius's evening match against Erkan Teper is overshadowed by a money dispute.
Ilta-Sanomat today reports on a summons application filed by boxing manager Jaakko Helminen and deputy judge Jussi Kokkila, in which Helenius and its interest on late payments are charged a total of just over €80,000 in unpaid manager fees.
According to the summons, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helenius from 15 April 2014 to 30 January 2015.
We have tried to mediate, but there is no alternative.
There has been a clear mandate here, and a great deal of work has been done, "Kokkila says to Ilta-Sanomat.
The current manager of Helenius, Markus Sundman, sent a reply to Iltalehti explaining the boxer's view of the events.
Helenius denies that it is obliged to pay the required amount.
According to the reply, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services in a financially difficult situation to Helenius and promised that they would be able to arrange matches and sponsor income for him.
Verbally, it had been agreed that Helenius would be liable to pay fees only for percentages of its matches.
It was repeatedly asserted that Helenius did not have to pay anything, only to receive the income they had arranged.
This is also normal and the only practice in the management of professional athletes.
Paid work has never been agreed and it would also have been absurd in the situation of Helenius, "Sundman explains in a message he has prepared.
There was never a written agreement on cooperation.
According to the reply, Helenius would have liked to have agreed on the distribution of income in writing from the beginning, but Kokkila and Sundman did not get the draft until the end of 2014.
For his part, he said that the proposal was poor and broke off cooperation with Kokkila and Helminen.
Helenius never once took part in his dealings with Kokkila and Helminen.
One year after the end of the collaboration, Helenius had been assigned an "unidentified but extensive" bill for the manager's work.
This year, proceedings have been brought with the same arguments.
Helenius considers Helminen and Kokkila's ex-post activities to be cowardly, the response states.
Helenius faces the boxing federation IBF in Stuttgart, the seventh on the heavyweight challenger list.
A heartfelt man and a good journalist
Ilkka "Ile" Vainio, an entertainer and music producer, knew the late radio presenter and journalist Erkki Pälli for decades.
Erkki Pälli, a long-term radio presenter and journalist, died at the age of 83 of incurable liver cancer.
The presenter's death announcement was published in Sunday's Helsingin Sanomat.
The announcement reports that Pälli died on 3 September.
Pälli reported the serious illness on his Facebook page in March 2018.
The publication was also seen at the time by Ile Vainio, who was saddened by the knowledge of his acquaintance's fate.
He left Facebook earlier as if he were farewell, "says Ile Vainio.
Vainio sees Erkki Pälli as a multi-talented expert who became a great journalist.
He recalls that Pälli was a well-liked person with quick hoxers and fun stuff.
I got to know Erk already as a little boy when I first went to Finnlevy at the age of 12 and started there as a warehouse man.
We got to know Erk at the time.
He was then a spokesman for Finnlevy and in various positions, "Ile Vainio recalls.
When I proceeded to make records as a music producer, there were hundreds of occasions where Erkki Pälli was a standard journalist at all parties doing stuff about artists.
He was always knowledgeable and I saw how big a fire he had for entertainment, music and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got straight to the skin of his interviewees.
He was a heartfelt man and a good journalist.
For many, he became familiar as a respected radio presenter of Yle, but he also wrote brilliant newspaper articles.
Erkki interviewed me several times as well.
He was good at talking, "Vainio praises.
Over the decades, Pälli worked not only as a journalist, but also in the Fazer record label with Toivo Kärje.
He was a music producer on Vesa-Matti Loir's records.
Pälli's greatest passion, however, was radio work, in which he had an original style.
He did radio work since the 1960s, and he became familiar to numerous listeners in Yle's ether.
Pälli retired in 1998.
The Finnish Ski Association announced on Saturday that the Federation's financial year, which ended in May, showed a profit of approximately EUR 450 000.
The union describes its economic situation as having undergone a "U-turn," although the economy is, of course, burdened with "significant debt on the balance sheet."
Executive Director Mika Kulmala praises the rapid response and strict financial discipline.
We reacted as quickly as possible last autumn, taking adjustment measures.
Careful planning of operations and financial management has been instilled throughout our organisation, "Kulmala says in a press release.
We have also been very successful in partner procurement and, in addition, the return on the World Cups was maximum in the past season.
However, cost management must continue to be rigorous and, at the same time, we must constantly look for new funding models.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then came the silence
Dozens of bodies lie in the backyard of a hospital in the town of palu on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Only one building separates them from the area where injured survivors have been assembled to assess injuries and the need for treatment.
Patients are also treated outdoors for aftershocks.
One of those moving around the hospital area was Baharuddin, a 52-year-old Palu, who was looking for his son.
Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
I have one child and he is missing.
I last spoke to him when he was going to school, "Baharuddin told the AFP news agency.
In the courtyard area of the army hospital in Palu lay Dwi Haris, who has suffered injuries to his back and arm.
He was in a local hotel with his wife and daughter when the quake began.
The family had been invited to the wedding party in Palu.
I probably had to squeeze under a collapsed wall.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what has happened to him and my child.
I hope they are safe, "Haris told the AP news agency, according to British media.
Small shops are looted
At the Palu evacuation centre, Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother of a small baby, tried to calm her hot baby.
He described the atmosphere in the city as strained.
Clean water is scarce.
Small shops are looted everywhere, "Kusuma said.
Many people in the palu have slept outdoors or in makeshift bamboo huts.
Even if the home is somewhat upright, any aftershocks could destroy it once and for all and bury the inhabitants beneath them.
According to the AP news agency, more than half of the prisoners in the palu prison escaped after the prison walls collapsed.
There were reportedly about 560 prisoners, so there are possibly about 300 fugitives.
Some of the prisoners at Donggala Prison have also escaped, according to The Jakarta Post.
According to the newspaper, prisoners were furious and set fire to the prison after guards banned them from going in search of their relatives affected by the earthquake and tsunami.
Palu Airport has been reopened mainly for aid flights.
Among the first to land at the airport was an army C-130 transport plane, which brought relief supplies.
Commercial flights to Palu Airport are only allowed to a limited extent.
Pilots are forced to land at the airport without the assistance of air traffic control, as the control tower was badly damaged in the earthquake.
Rain sweeps over Finland at night
A long area of rain will spread across the whole country on Sunday night from the west, according to the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
The rain comes mostly as water, but in central and northern Lapland it is expected to rain or snow.
The rocky frosts of the previous night are not going to happen again because under the cloud cover temperatures will remain higher.
A cloudier night keeps the lowest temperatures pretty effectively in check.
Just in the west you can momentarily visit the frosty side, "said on-call meteorologist Ville Ilkka.
On Sunday, the rain area will give way to the east during the morning.
In the south and west it is mild or semi-cloudy.
In the afternoon, temperatures move all the way to the height of Oulu around 10-13 degrees.
The coming week will look similar in terms of temperatures in the south and central parts of the country, but the weather will become more unstable.
Wind and wave warnings are in force in sea areas.
There are no actual autumn storms expected for the next few days, but otherwise there will be typically varying weather in the autumn.
Yes, that autumn is now starting to push on quite seriously, "Ilkka said.
Miss Finland final will not be seen on television
From IL-TV you can follow the red carpet glamour and sparkle of the Miss Finland competition.
The evening magazine's entertainment editors are pulling a live broadcast on IL-TV from the red carpet of the Miss Finland finale at Billnäs Ironworks.
The broadcast will start at around 6.50 p.m.
The new Miss Finland will be crowned on Saturday among ten finalists.
The Miss Finland 2018 finale will take place at the Billnäs pot in Raasepori.
Before the finale starts, you will be able to follow the atmosphere from the spot on the live broadcast of IL-TV.
The live broadcast starts around 6.30pm and continues for about an hour.
A particularly large number of Miss Finland winners from previous years have been invited to the final this year.

We hoped he would get to university before going to the mission games
Russian father Dimitri and Ingrian mother Svetlana believed in their daughter's success in the Miss Finland final.
The parents of the recent Miss Finland Alina Voronkova, Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkova, proudly followed their daughter's first moments at the head of the crown.
They smoked into the audience from Pertunmaa and were still going to drive back home after the final.
Have a wonderful atmosphere!
We believed in Erika all the time, but half an hour before the result started to get exciting, "Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana is Ingrian and Dimitri is Russian.
Alina speaks fluent Russian, even though she has lived throughout her childhood in Finland.
Svetlana says that Alina, as a small person, was more interested in acting and many other things than the career of the mission.
Alina was often told that when she is so pretty she should start as a mission.
But he indicated he wanted to be a radio presenter.
It was only later that Alina was inspired by beauty contests.
The parents' wish was for Alina to get to university before taking part in the Miss Finland competition.
That is what happened, and in the end Alina still wanted to do a Bachelor's degree before the mission games.
We already asked last year why he was not taking part, but he wanted to complete that cover.
Parents believe that Alina won the competition because she is a healthy example for young people and adults as well.
She sports a lot and eats healthily.
And Alina likes to be on display, it shows.
Alina's boyfriend Joonas Hurri is ice hockey for his job in Japan, and couldn't get to Finland to encourage his love in the final.
Alina's parents believe that the relationship between young people will last a mission year.
Yes, that is the intention!
The parents hoped that the daughter would soon be able to visit.
Now there has been such a long pause in visits due to mission hurdles.
It is already sad, even though messages have been put out.

Sari Piippo left her career in Brussels and became a housewife in Finland - the idea of a comic book came to mind: The lack of drawing skills did not slow down
The organic fool once left my husband's utterance, in which he suggested it as a person for a story I had developed, "says Sari Piippo, a comic book blogger from Espoo, a housewife and former EU translator.
Sari Piippo says she was an EU translator for economic and legal affairs in Brussels until after the fourth child, the family became a returnee ten years ago.
I have enjoyed being a housewife very well.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point it occurred to me that what would you do as a big child when even the smallest child was already starting to be big.
Then in 2014 a cartoon came into the picture.
Piippo says that he had never dreamed of making a comic book, even though he had read Donald Duck, Tintin and Asterix from a young age.
I had last drawn as a child, but when these manuscripts of the Organic fool began to emerge then, the situation changed.
At first I made some dozens of manuscripts in a drawer.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (b. 2000) is a skilled draughtsman, but I couldn't attract her until the summer of 2016, when I donate Viivi with the help of a drawing board.
His enthusiasm lasted a dozen Strips, and then he was forced to start trying himself, laughing Piippo, who says that the drawing board was a great incentive for him.
The drawing board is an easy and convenient tool to try to get something done.
On paper I didn't even try to draw, "says Piippo about his relationship with drawing, which he usually practices in the evenings.
The manuscripts keep popping into my mind, but usually I don't make ready at once.
One three-screen strip takes up to several hours.
I might make a screen at a time and I'm happy to play with the colours.
Starting drawing is always the hardest thing, because drawing is not my strongest sport.
Sari Piippo expresses her appreciation for the contemporary comics in newspapers, including Scott Adams's Dilbert.
The persons of the organic fool are a carrot-body mother with a salad hair pad, who has been inundated with the L-theme.
The other persons are Man, Pissis and Twins.
In the world of the organic fool, man is what he eats.
The ideas in the series come from one's own life and social media.
Sari Piippo does not want to preach or offer a straitjacket, even though the organic fool sometimes invades the matter.
Piippo says she reads her series with her husband and children.
After all, it is such a great feeling when you look at the cartoon you have drawn and say that this is what I have done today.
And there are plenty of challenges for the housewife!

Indonesia earthquake: Air traffic controller sacrificed himself - didn't leave cracking tower until he got hundreds of passengers safe
Anthonius Gunawan Agung, a 21-year-old air traffic controller, has become the hero of the earthquake in Indonesia.
Agung was left alone in an air traffic control tower until she was able to safely escort a passenger plane carrying hundreds of people from an earthquake-shaken island.
The youngster was on duty in air traffic control at Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport in the city of Palu when the earthquake struck on Friday.
As others fled the control tower, Agung refused to leave his seat before being able to steer the Batik Air passenger plane from the runway into the air.
This allowed him to save hundreds of lives, the Indonesian Aviation Administration told AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport on Saturday after the earthquake.
The control tower trembled and cracked.
Eventually, Agung tried to escape by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
His leg broke and he suffered serious visceral injuries.
Agung was rushed to a nearby hospital.
He was due to be transported by helicopter to a better equipped facility, but died 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, an aviation administration representative told The Jakarta Post.
The quake continued to intensify as the flight entered the air and was eventually measured at 7.5 magnitude.
At least 832 people lost their lives.
The Indonesian Aviation Administration has paid tribute to Agung's heroism on social media.
In general, Rehn wondered about Europe ending up in a trade war: "You have to look at the next tweet"
The trade war between the United States and China is reflected in the global economy as a whole.
Growth forecasts have been calculated throughout Europe and the Bank of Finland has also slightly lowered its own economic growth estimates.
Director-General Olli Rehn said in Yle's first morning that while the escalating tension will not have a direct impact on European trade flows, it will undermine confidence, which in turn will be reflected in companies' investment decisions.
The situation also applies to exports by Finnish companies.
For the time being, Mr Rehn believes that Europe is very much at stake.
It has been able to build an interim peace with the United States and has also helped to calm the situation with China and Japan.
In Rehn's view, Europe does not seem to be grinding to the feet of a trade war.
You have to look at the next tweet and evaluate after that.
We have a pretty unpredictable partner in Washington's direction, however, "he said in an interview with Yle.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of them is Italy, the third largest national economy in the euro area, which is also one of the most indebted countries in the euro area and in the Western world as a whole.
Yesterday, the markets reacted violently to the clearly deficit budget presented by the Italian Government on Thursday evening.
Next year's deficit is more than 2.4% of GDP.
Mr Rehn is concerned about the situation in Italy.
Five per cent of the country's loan stock is problem credit and more than ten per cent is unstructured credit.
Moreover, its public finances are weak and the country seems to be once again exceeding its commitments vis-à-vis its European partners.
It may not be worth painting yet more crises, Mr Rehn replied when asked whether Italy would take Europe into a new economic crisis.
Another issue affecting Europe is Britain's departure from the EU.
Rehn hoped it would be in harmony.
A contentious difference would have much more negative effects.
Rehn started as Governor of the Bank of Finland in July.
Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank (ECB), will withdraw in just over a year.
The debate about his successor has begun.
The name of both Rehn and his predecessor, Erkki Liikanen, has flashed in the speeches.
It probably doesn't matter if Finnish names are involved, "Rehn said, adding that he doesn't intend to comment further than this.
HS's super-popular Black Box shows will continue again next week - the last tickets to Helsinki are on sale
The popular Black Box performances organised by Helsingin Sanomat will continue again in the coming week.
Other performances will be seen at the National Theatre on October 2, 8 and 11.
On 23 October, the Black Box will visit Tampere Theatre for the first time.
There are still some tickets for the National Theatre for sale.
Tampere's performance is sold out.
Tickets are sold by Lippu.fi.
During the evening, journalists and photographers on stage will tell a long-prepared true story that has not previously been published in any of HS's instruments.
Again, there is something that no one has ever heard.
"There is a strange spy in the night of Helsinki, an impressive report from the other side of the globe and an eloquent story about a very topical health issue," says Esa Lilja, one of the producers of the Black Box.
After the performance, the audience will have the opportunity to meet with HS journalists and photographers and continue the discussion.
Helsingin Sanomat has organized evenings of living journalism for three years.
They have been popular from the start and often sold out.
More than 15,000 people have already visited the grandstand.
The black box was awarded at the Bonnier Gala as the journalistic act of the year.
The laureates praised the new way of doing journalism, as well as the desire of journalists to come close to their readers.
The Spring 2019 Black Box will be seen at the National Theatre between March and April.
The performance will also visit Tampere and Turku.
The presentation that will be seen at that time will have a different content from the evenings this autumn.
Missing mushroom inhibitor found thanks to "open-minded experiment"
The drone expertise of the Finnish police is among the best in the world: "We are asked about trainings"
According to the rector of the Police University of Applied Sciences, police can use a drone in addition to searching for missing persons, for example in crime scene investigations and intelligence missions.
On Tuesday, Oulu police managed to find a missing mushroom inhibitor in Raahe with the help of a drone in just a few minutes.
Kimmo Himberg, rector of the Police University of Applied Sciences, referred to the case and mentioned, among other things, that "through open-minded experimentation and effective training, we are a world leader here too."
The drone is quite a new capsizing and all the more recent in police duties.
There are no statistics anywhere that the Finnish police are the master of drone use.
According to Himberg, there is a strong perception that this is the case, however.
This has become clear, for example, when the experiences of the Finnish police have been reported at international events.
There is an awful lot of interest in it elsewhere, "says Himberg.
There would be a lot of visitors to watch the drone activities of the Finnish police.
We are asked for training.
Becoming even more common
Himberg points out that finding a missing person in Finland's winter conditions as soon as possible is very important.
As has been said, in the case of Raahe, the lost person was found with the help of a drone in just a few minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
According to Himberg, more of them are to be trained.
The drone is already widely used in police missions, and its use will become more common and increasing in the future.
That is what I would dare say, "says Himberg.
In addition to searching for missing persons, according to Himberg, police can use drones, for example, for accident or crime scene investigations and certain types of intelligence missions.
For example, you already have to go and check a region a little further, where there may be a fear that violence will be encountered there.
The drone can then be used for advance reconnaissance.
Karelian Rugby ascended to the First Divar
Karelian Rugby celebrated the victory of Division 2 in Kuopio on Saturday.
The Joensuu residents were still in the middle of the match with a 7-12 loss to Helsinki Rugby Club, but found a plot in the second period and strangled the visitors of the South 26-12.
At the same time, the 2-division championship knew the historical rise of Karelian Rugby to the 1-division.
In the past, the club has played in first place, but at that time Finnish rugby's series activities were divided into two levels, the Finnish Championship series and the multi-group 1 division.
The club is going to take up the league position, but it knows quite a lot of work next winter.
The current roster of less than twenty players needs to be increased to 25.
Division 1 also knows the increase in the number of games and longer game trips, so fundraising must also be in line with that.
Kotkaniemi to start season in Montreal, confirms head coach
Montreal Canadiens head coach Claude Julien, who plays hockey in the NHL, confirmed on the club's Twitter account that Finnish striker Jesperi Kotkaniemi will start the season in Montreal.
Montreal booked the super promise of Kotkaniemi, 18, in the first round with number three in the summer draft.
The attacker joined Montreal's training strength at the end of the summer and has presented strong excerpts in September's practice matches.
Kotkaniemi managed to score a goal in his first practice match.
Head coach Julien praised the Finn for taking big developments since arriving at the newcomer camp.
The NHL's Frame Series starts on Thursday night of next week in Finnish time.
Montreal faces the Toronto Maple Leafs in the opening round.
What is a good leader like?
A lot has been said this week in Finland about leadership.
Risto Siilasmaa, Chairman of Nokia's Board of Directors, told in an interview with HS about his book paranoid optimist, in which he sheds light on his philosophy of leadership.
At the same time, he criticises the leadership of his predecessor, Jorma Ollila.
Ollila vehemently denied the accusations, but even previous Nokia reports have talked about the inability of managers to act as a team; the fear and lack of speech that partly caused the collapse of the mobile phone business.
The risk-taking capacity and agility of the company's boom phase disappeared.
During the week, a giant business event Nordic Business Forum was also held in Helsinki, which drew the cream of Finnish business to the Exhibition Centre.
In addition to the main star Barack Obama, 12 stars from the business world took to the stage.
There was enough talk of good management.
Gary Hamel, a legend of management doctrines, said that a good manager must have the courage to take the company into the future even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are mentally most tied to the decisions of the past.
John Mackey, founder of the Whole Foods store chain, known for its wide range of organic products, said the manager needs to know how to communicate to all staff the company's purpose.
And that purpose cannot simply be to make a profit for the owners.
Susan Cain, who wrote a book of success about introverts, told me that the most successful leaders are proven to be humble.
They acted calmly, quietly and decisively.
Often they're introverts.
Finance professor Aswath Damodaran pointed out that the qualities of a good manager must coincide with the stage of a company's life cycle.
In the early stages of the company, the director must be able to tell the story on which the company's future is based.
A company that has grown into a mature phase needs a manager who knows the numbers.
These lessons were listened to by 7,500 visitors at the Nordic Business Forum - mainly Finnish leaders.
They were in danger of being informed.
A lot is required of a good leader.
That's why management so often goes wrong, even at the highest level.
Siilasmaa and Ollila were also present.
They talked to each other behind the scenes in a comradely manner.
However, they hardly wondered whether they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And it was not easy for an outsider to judge their humility.
Sara Chafak arrived gorgeous on the red carpet straight from Los Angeles - spending most of her year abroad
Model Sara Chafak arrived to the mission finale in a stunning black dress.
Miss Finland's impressive dress of 2012 also had Pitsinen's slouch.
A little poden jet lag.
I came again from Los Angeles.
To a large extent, I spend most of my time there, "Chafak says of his affiliation.
Chafak says he is going to Los for a test scan.
He has made advertising descriptions, among other things.
He describes his work in the United States as interesting, and also similar to that in Finland.
However, according to him, the work needs to be done even harder, as there is always an easy replacement for the work of the model.
You have to push harder and be aggressive, "Chafak says.

Danish police found Volvo searched for in major operation: "We can't tell you where"
Extensive searches by the Danish police have paid off.
At the beginning of the operation, traffic was closed on the Öresund and Great Belt bridges.
All land and ferry traffic from the island of Själlann was closed to Sweden, Germany and the rest of Denmark.
Police were looking for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
Is reached out to the shift manager of the Copenhagen Police Media Centre.
A searched car has been found.
We cannot yet tell where the car was found, "Henrik Storm from the Copenhagen police briefing tells Ilta-Sanomat.
According to Storm, the black Volvo sought has no direct connection to the threat, according to police.
According to him, the greatest danger is over.
Ekstra Bladet, from Denmark, reported on Saturday's police briefing.
The head of the investigation, Jørgen Bergen Skov, was silent on the conduct of the operation.
He did not want to say under what criminal title the matter was being investigated.
However, Mr Skov said it was a "serious crime."
It was a threat to people's lives.
Three people have been sought in the operation.
Police do not say whether they have already been apprehended.
According to the newspaper, restrictions on ferry services have been lifted.
Copenhagen police also followed events on their Twitter account.
The STT reports that police say there is no longer any cause for concern to the general public, however, as the threat was directed at certain people.
Macedonia's name has caused decades of discord - now the people are voting on the issue in contentious elections
A proposal for a new name for the country is currently being put to the vote in Macedonia in the Balkans.
Under the agreement between the Macedonian and Greek Governments, the name would be the Republic of North Macedonia.
Greece has so far vetoed Macedonia's efforts to become a member of NATO and the EU.
Greece says the name Macedonia belongs to its northern province.
The question of the referendum does not mention a new name, but asks whether the voter is in favour of Macedonia's membership of the EU and NATO by approving the agreement.
Voting started sluggishly, at least at a school in the centre of the capital, Skopje.
Olivera Argirosvka, a retired nurse who voted at the school, hoped for support for the agreement.
A referendum will mean change if it opens the doors to Europe and NATO.
It means change, especially for young people, "he said.
Macedonia, which gained independence in 1991, has been officially referred to as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev's government has campaigned for the agreement to be approved.
The nationalist right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has called for a boycott of the referendum.
In addition to the result, there is plenty of tension as to whether the turnout will rise above the required 50%.
The referendum is not binding, but a'yes' vote would give a mandate to change the constitution.
A two-thirds majority in Parliament is needed to amend the Constitution.
The agreement has also yet to be approved by the Greek Parliament.
Polling stations close at 8 p.m. Finnish time.
A handsome victory!
Robert Helenius knocked out Erkan Teper
Robert Helenius faced Erkan Teper late on Saturday night in a heavyweight professional boxing match in Germany.
The 34-year-old Finn took a measure of his 36-year-old German opponent at Waldenbuch, near Stuttgart.
The main match of the evening was the IBF heavyweight Intercontinental title match.
An opportunity may open up for its winner to be able to match the tougher tasks seen on Saturday, which are of considerable economic importance.
Helenius finished the match in the eighth period, when he knocked out Teper with his hard left-hand strike.
Teper was no longer able to get out of the floor.
"Nordic Nightmare" hurt her opponent as early as the third period, when blood began to bleed from the German's nose.
Helenius and Teper met in the ring for the first time.
They had to match back in December 2015.
That's when Teper appealed for injury and withdrew from the match.
It then emerged that the German had curled up twice in a doping test.
Helenius has taken 28 matches out of the matches of his professional career and suffered two losses.
Teper, who went into the match as a clear favourite, has won 19 professional matches in his career and lost three times.
Hamilton on stable order to win - difference to Vettel already 50 points
The Formula One championship title was once again approaching its confirmation, as Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton won the Russian GP and stretched his World Cup points lead to Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel to 50 points (306-256).
There are only five races left.
Valtteri Bottas, who entered the race from pole position, drove second.
Bottas, who took the opening victory of his career in Sochi last year, held the top spot near the middle of the race, but Mercedes told Botta to let Hamilton pass.
Vettel drove third, Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen fourth.
Red Bull's Max Verstappen, who started from the last start line, was fifth.
The duo assaulted a jute man in Joensuu - caught a block away
Two men assaulted and kicked a 31-year-old jute man in Joensuu at Siltakatu 12 on Saturday after 18: 00.
According to police, the men also appropriated the victim's phone, among other things.
Police reached the suspects, a 35-year-old man with hay water, and a 39-year-old man from Ilomantsi, a block away shortly after the incident.
They were apprehended on suspicion of robbery, police say.
The victim suffered bruise injuries that did not require a visit to the doctor.
Elon Musk, CEO of electric car company Tesla, will leave his position as chairman of the company's board of directors.
Mr Musk has agreed with the US authorities.
At the same time, Musk has been fined $20 million for his tweets that he would have secured funding to withdraw Tesla from the stock exchange.
Mr Musk has been accused of securities fraud by the US Securities Commission (SEC).
Mr Musk will continue to be Tesla's chief executive, but the firm will also have to pay €20 million in fines if the agreement between the authorities and musk is confirmed in court.
Canada fights against time to reach agreement on NAFTA with US
Time is threatening to run out in the middle of negotiations between the United States and Canada on a free trade agreement on NAFTA.
The United States has set a deadline of Sunday, and their negotiators have been talking closely through the weekend.
Canada's chief negotiator, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, postponed her speech to the UN General Assembly in order to focus on trade negotiations to the full.
At the insistence of President Donald Trump, the United States, Canada and Mexico began negotiations about a year ago to reform the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached an agreement, but no agreement has yet been reached with Canada.
The United States and Mexico want to bring the agreement into force before Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who won the Mexican presidential election, takes office in early December.
Trump has said that Canada's involvement in the agreement is not necessary.
He has previously informed Congress that there are plans to sign the agreement at the end of November - whether Canada is involved or not.
In view of these timetables, the text of the agreement between the United States and Canada should be ready on Sunday to allow sufficient time for the US Congress to assess it.

Candles burned in a block of flats in Kaakkuri, Oulu, caused a fire alarm on Sunday night.
A dozen emergency services were called to the scene due to a possible apartment fire.
It emerged that the candles burned in the sauna of the apartment block had looked like a fire in the opposite house, which was why the emergency centre had been notified.
There was no fire at the site.
Police apprehended 11 people after the Honka-HJK match - brawling on the ground and at the subway station
Eleven people were apprehended by police after the men's football league Honka-HJK match in Espoo on Saturday, the crime commissioner of the West Uusimaa Police Department, Teemu Värtinen, confirmed to STT.
The grounds for apprehension were protection against crime and interference.
Those captured were released after the situation had calmed down, Värtinen said.
In the past, Ilta-Sanomat reported on the apprehensions.
The match ended 0-0.
After the final whistle, a large crowd of spectators rushed to the field from the grandstand reserved for HJK supporters.
The situation led to cuddling and fist fights between supporters of the teams.
Among other things, cavalry police were needed to put an end to the situation.
In addition to the airport, the ramming took place in the area of a nearby metro station, where some of the apprehensions also took place.
I was not here, but what I saw from the pictures was an unpleasant situation, "Värtinen referred to the rattling on the ground.
According to Värtinen, no criminal reports have been made as a result of the events.
Pöytäkivi fouled the butterfly in his SE time in the World Cup, Laukkanen also swam to the final
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Pöytäkivi have advanced to the finals on the final day of the World Cup 3 / 7 in the Netherlands.
The Games are swimming in Eindhoven on a short track.
HSS's Table Stone was alarmed by his Finnish record in the 50-metre butterfly, where he was second in the early stages at 22.82.
Earlier in September, Table Stone swam in Helsinki for a trip to SE time of 22.77.
Ari-Pekka Liukkonen, representing Cetus from Espoo, was 24th in the butterfly race with a time of 24.68.
Swimming Club Vuokatin Laukkanen was sixth in the first round of the 50-metre breaststroke at 30.48 and advanced to the final.
In the first round of the two hundred metres, Laukkanen was 15th with a time of 2.14.25.
Students play a rare treat: The ancient tragedy - the simplistic Oresteia affects with its visuality
Ancient tragedies are a rare treat on Finnish stages.
For example, the National Theatre last saw an ancient tragedy, the Sofocles Filoktetes, in 1988.
Now the Theatre Academy brought to the tour, which begins at the National Theatre, the only complete play trilogy in antiquity, the Oresteia of Aiskhylos.
In the Lavat Open! Projects, which started in 2015, acting students at the Theatre Academy work together with a professional director internationally.
This fourth project, like the first, is directed by Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
Oresteia had its international premiere in Berlin in April.
Roiha's atonement for Oresteia sums up the story of the end of the blood vengeance of the doomed Atreus family and the birth of the rule of law to the credit of an hour and twenty minutes, especially by condensing the choir sections.
The work manages to be very faithful to the spirit of Kirsti Simonsuuri's fine Suomennos (2003).
The dramatic lights and the presentation revealing the pages of the theatre space highlight simplistic and bright stage thinking.
Its focus is alternately on the dynamics between performers who break away from the choir, who play name roles, and the choir.
The presentation uses both double and triple entries for name roles.
The actors do not leave the stage at all, so, for example, the murders of Agamemnon, who returns from the Trojan War, and Kassandra, who returns to his spoils, are also shown on the stage, contrary to what was customary in ancient performance radio.
Of course, the performance does not stress that it is faithful to ancient performance radio.
Rather, a modern interpretation, faithful to the text, is created in front of the viewer's eyes, constantly aware of its ritual roots.
Roiha has managed to bring out a rhythmic group of acting students from the master stage as a close group, even as one organism.
Especially in the choir sections, actors who bow to very expressive, sculptural group formations get their rights on the bare stage, adorned only with a white curtain.
Active.
Oresteia's performance tour continues to Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.
Korean manufacturer manufactures its first hydrogen crane
This novelty is beginning to be felt in Europe, thanks in particular to the cooperation agreement between Hyindai and the Swiss company H2 Energy.
According to a cooperation agreement published at the IAA commercial vehicle exhibition in Hanover, Hyundai will supply a batch of 1,000 cars with a new model for use by the Swiss company and its partners.
By launching a fuel cell powered truck, Hyundai continues on the path mapped out by Nexo and the ix35 / Tucson Fuel Cell models as a manufacturer of hydrogen cars.
With this first project of its kind in the world, we are taking fuel cell technology even further.
We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market for these vehicles, for example by monitoring the development of the refuelling network, "In Cheol Lee, Vice President of Hyundai Motor, said at the launch of the contract.
Fists swim several times in Kajaani
Three men were assaulted by a man of just over thirty in a restaurant in the centre of Kajaani and in front of it on Saturday morning.
The man first struck one man inside the restaurant, as a result of which he was removed.
Outside, he pushed another man to the ground, and in the absence of a third man, the assailant struck him as well.
Police apprehended the assailant.
At the police station, the man continued to behave aggressively and kicked another police officer in the leg.
The man also threatened police with assault and killing.
The man was taken to the buck to calm down.
The matter is being investigated in the form of three assaults, as well as violent opposition to the official.
In the centre of Kajaani, there was also another case of assault on Välikatu on Saturday morning.
The victim was assaulted by two men.
First, a Kajaani man, about 20 years old, struck the victim.
A short time later, another man knocked him down and the man who had previously struck him still kicked the victim.
Outsiders pulled the assailants further away from the victim and police were called.
However, the perpetrators already had time to leave before the police arrived.
Police ask witnesses of the incident to contact Kajaani police by phone 0295 416 520 or by e-mail at investigation.kainuu @ poli.fi.
Long-term radio presenter Erkki Pälli has died
Erkki Pälli, known as a very long-term journalist, died of cancer at the age of 83.
Radio presenter Erkki Pälli, 83, has died.
He died of incurable liver cancer, which was reported on his Facebook page in March 2018.
Yes, this is the way to go now.
The doctor has said it too, I live one day at a time, "he commented on his situation to the Evening Journal a month ago.
The safety of trade aunts and sets must be guaranteed;
I was first paid for a newspaper article in 1984.
When you get amazed by some of the stuff on these year rings, it's usually a big news story.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27.9.) about the insecurity of retail workers, I was amazed and at times even a little angry.
I also spoke to Erika Kähärää, a working environment expert at the Trade Union of Services (PAM).
He says crime statistics do not reflect the reality of the situation.
The problem is growing, although employers, of course, claim otherwise.
Only cases that are clearly perceived to be serious are brought to the attention of the police and many of the right situations of violence remain unreported.
"Of course, companies have a duty to record their near misses on the basis of the Occupational Safety Act but these statistics remain for internal use and their data are not collected anywhere," he said.
Mental disabilities do not end up in statistics.
In situations of violence, there has always been the problem that they do not always cause physical injury.
Despite this, mental trauma can be much more serious than bruising and wounds.
The distinction between a situation of violence and a threatening situation of violence is difficult to draw when even a certain level of aggressive intimidation has to be counted as violence - even if there is no access.
Too many people are afraid at their workplace, even if the actual act does not happen.
Some neighbourhoods are restless.
The store has acquired guards.
With the release of shop opening hours, there was also a considerable slackening in the media about its impact on vendors' safety.
"At that time, quite a few employers organised guard services at least for night-time hours and to prevent working alone," Kähärä commented.
When nothing happens, the wrong conclusion is drawn.
This now seems to have had an effective effect, but this produces a new negative trend.
When, as a result of the guarding, the disturbances remained well in hand, the impression was created that the guarding would be unnecessary.
Now, in many places, attempts are being made to find solutions that could eliminate expensive guard services.
A minor assault is a plaintiff's crime, and it is quite understandable that a seller who has been assaulted does not want to make a request for an investigation into a criminal who usually lives near a shop.
But under the same subparagraph of the law, which was enacted in 2011, a minor assault becomes subject to a prosecutor if it takes place in the workplace.
I believe that we now need precedents.
The next time an aunt or uncle of a shop is assaulted, the police should investigate and the prosecutor should prosecute.
When the court would put a few assailants in jail, and the sentence from there from the hard end of the penalty scale, then the habits would be tidied up.
A society in which the food trade must be open almost day and night, even in small places, must guarantee the safety of its employees.
Heidi Sohlberg set off for the mission before the live broadcast began - "Sara, Iiro is then married"
The crowning of the mission will not be seen in the traditional way on TV this year; the broadcast will be shown on the Viafree website.
The broadcast is hosted by former Miss Finland Heidi Sohlberg and Iiro Harjula, host of Viasat and Viaplay's NHL and KHL studios.
The presenter of Backstage and the red carpet is Janni Hussi.
Before the live broadcast, the presenter trio told invited guests and media representatives who had arrived about the broadcast's progress.
At first, Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harjula a resounding applause.
Now all the women are screaming!
Now look at this male presenter of ours, Sohlberg was glowing with his colleagues as the audience cheered.
Many of the leading races are followed by Miss Finland from previous years.
Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi, among others, sat side by side and Sohlberg threw a little joke in either direction.
Sara, Iiro is married then!
Sohlberg parted looking towards Saros.
The more likely Sohlberg was referring to Sieppi, who had just resigned with her throw, who laughed at the comment, even though she seemed confused at first.
Sieppi spoke about her resignation for the first time in Ilta-Sanomat's weekend magazine.
She said that she did not want to open up the reasons for the separation in more detail in public, as it was a matter between her and Scrooge Salminen.
He said he was not in a hurry for a new relationship; he was going to focus on himself.
I focus on my own stuff and especially I start living my own life alone, "Sara Sieppi said.
Harjula's marriage status came up even later when Sohlberg accidentally made the mistake of calling Janni Huss and Iiro Harjula a couple.
The trio of runners laughed at the moka.
Iirohan was married or how did it go?
Janni Hussi set off the mound.
The Northern man tortured his bound cohabiting partner by slashing, burning and feeding a strong sauce
The District Court of Ostrobothnia has sentenced a 34-year-old man living in Kokkola to three years in prison for numerous offences against his cohabiting partner.
The crime-making tool included a belt, cable and bundle ties.
The court condemned the items in question as lost to the state.
Rankin's charge concerned a suspected aggravated rape.
However, this charge was dismissed by the district court.
Four assaults, aggravated assault, coercion, unlawful threat, deprivation of liberty, aggravated deprivation of liberty and two damages were attributed to the Kokkola citizen.
The offences took place between 26 March last and 24 May.
At the end of the last acts, the man was apprehended and imprisoned a few days later.
On Thursday of the past week, the District Court of Ostrobothnia handed down its sentence and ordered the 34-year-old to continue to be held in Vaasa Prison.
No evidence of rape
The 34-year-old was also charged with two counts of aggravated deprivation of liberty and aggravated rape on May 22.
However, these charges were dismissed by the court as unproven.
The case was heard in court behind closed doors.
However, the district judge gave a public account of the ruling.
According to the magistrate, the accused had subjected his spouse to violence, threats and coercion in situations where he had been bound.
The accused cut his victim with a knife, smoked tobacco, fed a strong sauce and poured water and coffee over him.
In its judgment, the court ordered the state to confiscate criminal equipment: A belt and cable, cable ties, a bathrobe belt, a knife and a locomotive.
Four Witnesses
According to the district court, the parties continued to live together between the acts.
It can be read from the sentence statement that a large proportion of the most aggravated acts took place at the end of the crime period.
Four witnesses, two women and two men were heard in court.
For his victim, the 34-year-old must pay a total of EUR 5800 for pain, suffering, suffering and temporary harm.
He hardly has that money, because the sentenced person already has debts to recover.
The prison sentence is not the man's first.
The Evening Journal does not give the name of the sentenced person to protect the victim's privacy.

On Saturday, European golf professionals consolidated their lead in a traditional hole game match against the United States.
Europe leads the Ryder Cup on the outskirts of Paris with a score of 10-6, while there are still twelve singles to be played on Sunday.
Europe won three of the four quadruple-ball matches that started Saturday, and in the afternoon's doubles, the victories were tied at 2-2.
Europe's leading stars were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four matches they played as a pair on Friday and Saturday.
In the past, no European couple had achieved this.
On Sunday, the duo will pursue more history.
No European player has won five points in one Ryder Cup, and there have been only three players from the Americans: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK condemns the violent harassment of its supporters at the Honka match: "Violence is not part of football"
Football betting league team HJK released a press release on Sunday condemning the disruptive behaviour of its supporters at Saturday's FC Honka match in Tapiola.
"We regret the events following the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our supporters," the release states.
At the end of the match, about 50 HJK supporters rushed onto the pitch and some appeared to be seeking to challenge the dispute with Honga supporters.
There was also a fight between supporters.
The stewards could not calm the situation down and police and also cavalry officers were needed.
HJK says in its press release that the team's players and staff are shocked by what happened.
Post-match events are not in line with the values of our traditional 111-year-old club.
"We strongly dissociate ourselves from any activity that endangers the safety of match events," the release states.
HJK promises to help authorities and event organisers identify threats to security and eliminate side-effects.
Supporter culture is part of football and an important issue for HJK.
We fully support positive, joyful and supportive action in football stands.
"Violence is not part of it," the press release says.
Philippine inventor flies a drone car - avoiding traffic jams
Mendiola is a Filipino inventor, hip-hop dancer and some kind of Pelle Peloton.
He is now among a growing number around the world who swear that they have invented a flying car - or at least their own version of it.
As competitors, he has factors such as Audi and Airbus.
However, Mendiola does not believe in mass production of its equipment.
According to reports from around the world, the man has spent much of his fortune building his dream.
Six years ago, he started developing his flying car.
Now he calls the development version a drone car.
Recently, he says he made the first successful test flight - he flagged with his device at an altitude of more than seven metres.
One of his aims was to avoid traffic jams.
I hope that the device will provoke positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago, "Mendiola said, according to the British Daily Mail.
JHL anticipates: Industrial action starting tomorrow will be visible in children's day care and social and health services
In the public and welfare sectors, the bans on overtime and shift changes starting tomorrow are particularly visible in social and health services and child day care, according to JHL Chairman Päivi Niemi-Laine.
The effects will be extensive and will certainly be felt in such a way that there are not enough staff on the ground.
Everyone has to think about how to pick up their children.
It is now up to the employer to ensure that the services play and that no one's life is threatened, "Niemi-Laine says to STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the shortage of employees was also visible at the beginning of the year, when JHL members were banned from overtime and shifts due to contract negotiations.
Through flexibility, employers have made it possible for staff not to be employed, but to remain in overtime or to change shifts.
This is not yet an industrial action.
From the point of view of health and safety at work, it is the norm that, for every worker, regular working hours are taken care of and only done.
By taking action, the JHL opposes the government's intention to lighten the protection of small businesses from redundancy.
Markku Jalonen, Labour Market Director for Local Government Employers, does not undertake a prior assessment of the impact of overtime and shift bans.
However, he does not believe that they are very revolutionary, although services may be weakened.
Employers around Finland are aware of this and have made the preparations that can be done.
It is such an impossibly large area, a social and health service and a technical sector that it is difficult to say.
The impacts can vary very much by industry, region and employer, Jalonen said to STT.
Jalonen says that last week we already had experience of similar activities lasting three days, including those of the Association of Local and Primary Nurses (Super) and the Social and Health Care Trade Union (Tehy).
Their impact was quite limited.
The ban on overtime and shift change in the JHL applies to municipal, church, state and private social and health care workers, among others.
Family day carers, for example, are excluded.
Nearly 100,000 JHL members are affected by the industrial action at this stage.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL's actions may take a long time.
The union is also prepared for other industrial action if preparations for the redundancy law continue.
The government should now admit that here we are running to the wall and hard.
Mr Jalonen believes that both the trade union movement and the government must meet.
What is special about this is that the hard ones are already in the pipe, even though the performance has not yet been given, Jalonen updates.
A large coral reef is created by children and adults - the performance's fitness circles study the gestures of rays and seahorses
The Great Coral Reef of the Other Spaces collective premiered last spring in Hamburg and last Saturday it was performed for the second time in Finland, this time in Kanneltalo.
Like the group's previous works, the Great Coral Reef is a work that is built from start to finish together with the public.
This time, however, a clearer-cut presentation will also be built, which will refresh and encapsulate the observations made in the initial exercises.
There is plenty of fairytale magic in theatre play for child attendees as well.
The child's perspective has already been included in the preparation of the work.
However, the great coral reef is not a children's performance, but a performance made by adults and children in collaboration.
It provides adults with information and observations about the way children receive information and make art.
Children's ability to indulge in exercises and joint games also reduces the distance between adults and children.
Indeed, the great coral reef bears some resemblance to the fairytale ballet, the fitness circuit and the nature-themed quiz, but it is finally tuned around visits to other, non-human conditions.
The great coral reef begins with getting to know the trajectories of corals and organisms and fish living on the coral reef.
Six different fitness districts teach, among other things, the gestures of rays and seahorses.
Finally, a performance lasting less than an hour will be made in which music, lights and shiny paints and costumes will help you get to know the life of the coral reef.
There are both diving people in the Great Coral Reef who observe the life of the coral reef and the corals that are being looked at.
There are also organisms that look at corals.
The eyes and observations pointed in many directions make the performance dense and life-buzzing.
Be it the landscape of an organism, the organism that looks at the landscape, or another organism or landscape that looks at the organism - and all this at the same time.
For children, it does not seem difficult in any way.
In other spaces, the group uses its exercises to try to reach the limit of thinking and action, which is challenging to reach when the group is made up of both children and adults.
On the other hand, the involvement of children makes it more significant.
After the workshop, a silent demonstration will be held in Sitratori on behalf of endangered corals.
Destruction beyond human understanding must not be allowed to harden, although it could be difficult to comprehend the significance of one's own exercise of compassion in the face of the prospect of destruction.
In other spaces, it has built its works in such a way that it respects the diversity of life, including through a political gesture.
There are other generations, there are other kinds of consciousness, other species and their future generations, for whose wonder and play it clears up space.
Children are growing up too fast - I'm happy that there were no smartphones in my childhood
Today's children and young people are becoming increasingly irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking at an ever younger and younger age.
In my opinion, children should be children throughout their childhood, and not mess with their lives because of substance abuse and sex, because others say they do too.
I was taken aback when my friend told me that he had had to pick up his fifth-grade sister at the weekend from a "boyfriend."
When she came to get her drunk sister, she shared her sex experiences from that evening.
I could not possibly imagine my own sister in the same situation, because we have been told and warned throughout our childhood that substance abuse must not be touched and sex is an adult affair.
I hope that today's children will be able to live a decent childhood and not have to grow up too early because of the group pressure created by friends.
I keep seeing younger and younger girls on Instagram who are in their pictures with make-up in their faces and revealing clothes on their heads.
Snapchat is used in the evenings to take and send revealing photos.
It is becoming increasingly difficult for girls to guess what age they are.
Today's 13-year-olds can easily look like 18-year-olds and parents too.
My childhood consisted of playing in the woods and playing board games.
I am happy that there were no smartphones in my childhood.
I got to be a child for many years and didn't have to think about what others think of me.
YLE: Authorities told state leadership that the case Airiston Helmi is not related to national security
According to Ilkka Kanerva, interviewed by Yle, the protection police and the armed forces went to inform the defence and foreign affairs committees earlier this week.
The Finnish state leadership has been told that Airiston Helmi's investigation is not currently related to national security, but to organised crime, reports Yle.
The information from anonymous sources was confirmed to Yle by the Chairman of the Defence Committee, Ilkka Kanerva (chef).
According to Kanerva, the military and the protection police visited the defence and foreign affairs committees this week to report on the ongoing investigation.
This is considered primarily to be financial crime.
They were quite strict about not speculating that there was anything else here, "Kanerva commented in an interview with Yle.
It is widely reported that no evidence of a link to national security has so far been found in the seized material, but the investigation is only just beginning.
There is nothing we can know yet about what can be revealed there, "says one of Yle's interviewees.
The extensive house searches that began a week ago in the Turku archipelago and on the mainland have raised the question of whether the investigation is merely a matter of financial crime or a threat to Finland's internal security.
Earlier this week, the Evening Journal compiled a story reviewing the allegations both for and against.
Video: Dream goal saved Liverpool's losing series
Liverpool's 100 per cent Premier League start came to an end, but it was still a happier team for the 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge.
On Sunday it will be exactly a year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and escaped with a 1-0 away win.
Then Pep Guardiola's combination sent a signal throughout the Premier League that City were now serious.
Everyone remembers how last season ended.
And certainly Liverpool manager Jûrgen Klopp arrived in West London with the same idea.
The Reds had started the Premier League with six consecutive victories.
Liverpool started stronger and Virgil van Dijk, in particular, seemed to dominate his own field end alone.
Chelsea, meanwhile, had a fine League Cup away win at Anfield Road on Wednesday.
That's when Eden Hazard emerged from the bench to solve the match with a great individual performance.
Now, of course, Hazard was involved right from the early minutes.
In the 25th minute, he first ballooned in a small space with the three-game Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
In the end, the Croat saw Hazard plunge forward and sent him a perfectly weighted pass-through.
Hazard drifted a bit to the edge of the penalty area, but from there bombed a perfect left-foot pull into the back corner.
Pool brace guard ALISSON was a bit slow in his fight and couldn't get more than his fingertip on the ball.
Klopp certainly felt the losing position lightly unfair because, almost immediately after, Antonio Rüdiger cleared Mo Salah's guidance from the goal line.
In the second period, Chelsea watcher Kepa also got into action.
The Basque keeper reacted quickly to Sadio Mané's pull and pushed the ball from the base of the post into a corner kick.
At the other end, on the other hand, ALISSON snuffed through Hazard with his throwback.
The guests "best place came in the 72nd minute when James Milner found Bobby Firmino with his focus.
However, the brace star's butt was directed towards national teammate David Luiz, who saved the hosts' lead.
Even that didn't last any longer in the 89th minute, when replacement Daniel Sturridge was free to shoot from 25 metres.
Sturridge played in his old home stadium, and the attacker bombed an irresistible pull into the top corner in honour of it.
Liverpool's 100 per cent league start came to an end with a 1-1 draw, but it is still top of the league - along with Manchester City.
Chelsea are also firmly involved in the championship with two points behind the top.
In the clock transfer debate, the pods are deep
I remember when, a few decades ago, a newspaper asked various Finnish figures what divides the Finnish people.
Juice Leskinen's answer was the only one left in my mind: Nen-terminal.
Some have a ne-ending in their surname and some do not.
After all, divisions can arise anywhere, and here was one bidder.
Finland has brought about the abolition of the annual clock shift in the EU.
Very many people agree that clockwork twice a year has been the job of fools and has caused a wide range of problems.
In the end, this achievement seems to be the easiest stage of the solution, at least in Finland, although it has not been easy.
The most difficult thing now is to decide what time of day we will end up with: The current summer or winter time or some other time zone.
This also allows the people to express their opinion on the Otakantaa.fi page.
The inquiry has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and will be open until Friday 12 October.
The debate is fiercely taking place at coffee tables and on social media, and everyone has their say.
Those who defend winter time justify their position with the effect of morning light on people's well-being and summer time are defended by the effect of evening light on people's desire to go outdoors and thus on their well-being.
Both positions have strong supporters and good arguments.
Studies have also shown that morning light rhythms a person's day and provides vitality.
On the other hand, if you do not particularly suffer from waking up in the dark, the light increases the movement of people outside and gives better opportunities, for example, for autumn yard work.
The amount of additional light after a normal working day has already been calculated for an hour.
I would prefer to take both, but bad enough for our location in the north of the planet, we can do nothing.
Winters are too dark and summers too bright for many anyway.
A typical feature of the debate on this subject is that one's own view is being promoted and the other's view is being very strongly opposed.
The arguments of the other side are hardly listened to, because the most important thing is how the matter feels about itself.
Since almost everyone has an opinion on the matter, it is somewhat pointless to try to turn the other's head.
It burns the powder in vain.
It is a terribly easy subject to debate, because it does not require a great deal of effort and there is enough mud to justify it.
Similar issues are usually the subject of the sharpest and equally fruitless controversy in any case.
It will be a pity if the wrong option is chosen, but it will not be adapted to that either.
And it always offers a suitable scapegoat, too, if life feels apathy.
Josba struggled for a close away victory
Josba's first away game in the floorball divar produced a full three series points against Nurmon Jymy.
Josba went home from Seinäjoki with a joyous 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) win.
Nurmo still led with a goal at the start of the third period, but Josba sought compositions and recycled men in chains.
In time 50.47 brothers Eetu and Juuso Lehtiniemi plotted a 6-5 winning goal.
As both teams cooled down, crucial minutes were played flat.
Josba's most effective was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2 + 1).
Kakkosketju was firepower anyway, when Teemu Tuhkanen (1 + 1), Jere Kaartinen (1 + 0) and Jere Kettunen (1 + 0) also hit.
Miika Kosonen (1 + 0) also played in the kakkosketju at the time of her goal.
Josba has six points after three series rounds.
Next we will meet O2-Jyväskylä in two weeks' time.
In the church of Eno on Sunday 200 years anniversary
The 200th anniversary of Eno Church will be celebrated tomorrow Sunday, partly in a very sad atmosphere.
A week ago, the arson of a church in Kiihtelysvaara was a shock.
Eno Church was also guarded in the two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, today is still a place for celebration.
Even if no one wants that, Eno Church is now the oldest church in the Joensuu Parish Association.
The church on the hill in the middle of the village has always been the heart of Eno, despite the municipal and other connections of all the world.
The Family Mass begins at Eno Church today at 10 a.m.
After that we move to the parish house by the Karelian banquet table.
There are all kinds of things in the program throughout the day, both inside and outside.
For example, you can visit the church building with the guidance of Ari Räsänen, who has retired and has been a parish master for 37 years.
The church's birthday celebration also marks the end of an era.
The already disused parish house, built in 1982, will keep its doors open today for the last time.
We are now in evasive spaces at the former town hall, "says Markku Koistinen, chaplain.
The parish house was destroyed by indoor air problems, but the church has been standing in its healthy place for that 200 years.
Elon Musk to step down as chairman of Tesla board - Fraud charges settled for $40 million
Electric car maker Tesla and the company's CEO, Elon Musk, have settled their lawsuit with the US Securities Markets Authority (SEC).
The SEC suspected musk was guilty of securities fraud, and Musk was at risk of being sidelined as a result of the company he founded.
However, Musk is allowed to continue as Tesla's CEO.
Instead, Musk will have to step down as chairman of Tesla's board for three years.
The company will have to hire an external board chairman.
Mr Musk will also be subject to stricter controls.
Under the agreement, Tesla will have to hire two independent directors and monitor musk's communications more closely in the future.
In addition, Tesla and Musk will each pay $20 million (about €17 million) to settle the case.
"The decision is intended to prevent further market disruption and harm to Tesla shareholders," says Director Steven Peikin of the SEC.
The incident began in August when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might pull the company off the stock exchange.
Mr Musk also wrote that the company's funding was secured.
Tviitti momentarily raised Tesla's share price.
The SEC suspected musk was guilty of securities fraud.
According to the agency, the tweet was false and misleading, and Musk had not talked about an arrangement with the company's other management or potential financiers.
In practice, the agency accused Musk of misleading investors.
The SEC announced on Friday that it would sue the company and musk.
The SEC said it was calling for Musk to be fined and banned from running listed companies any longer.
The SEC's challenge scared investors, and Tesla's stock went down sharply.
More than 800 people killed in Indonesia quake and tsunami
The number of people killed in the earthquake in Indonesia and the tsunami that followed has risen to at least 832, according to AFP, the country's disaster agency.
The number of deaths is expected to increase further, as the damage is still being investigated.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kalla, the final figure could reach thousands.
Friday's earthquake sparked a tsunami that hit the town of Palu on the island of Sulawesi.
A warning was issued about the tsunami immediately after the quake, but it was quickly withdrawn.
According to the authorities, almost all known deaths are, at least for the time being, Palu.
Rescue authorities are concerned, among other things, about the Donggala area near the centre of the quake, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Many people are already known to have died.
Requests for help from the rubble
The Indonesian army has been called in to help rescue workers search for victims.
President Joko Widodon, who arrived in the affected area today, urged the soldiers to continue the rescue work tirelessly day and night.
One of the focal points of the rescue work is a hotel in Palu, where 50-60 people are still believed to be in the rubble.
Muhammad Syaugi, head of the agency leading the rescue work, said that one person could be dug alive at night from the ruins of the Roa-Roa hotel, which is popular with business travellers.
We also heard people's requests for help, "he said.
According to Syaug, heavy clearing equipment would be needed quickly for the quake and tsunami area.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their missing loved ones.
Please help, you in Palu and nearby.
My friend's family members still missing, one author pleaded in a Facebook group.
Politicians' phone numbers leaked into the hands of troublemakers in Britain
Many British politicians were harassed when their contact details were leaked due to flaws in the app's encryption.
The troublemakers were able to access, among other things, ministers' telephone numbers.
It was an app used at the party congress of the British Conservative Party in government.
For example, Michael Gove, the Minister for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, who is pushing for Brexit, and Boris Johnson, the former Foreign Secretary, were harassed.
Several MPs received harassment calls.
Due to a lack of encryption in the app, the public was able to access the profiles of politicians who were on the mobile app for the Conservative Party's annual conference.
The public was able to access the profiles using the politician's email address, which was easily accessible online.
Anyone logging into the profile was able to view and edit the material stored in the profile.
Someone managed to change Boris Johnson's profile picture for a moment to a pornographic image and title insulting.
Michael Goven's profile picture was changed to that of media mogul Rupert Murdoch.
The Guardian columnist Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that the meeting app allows you to log into other people's profiles with their email addresses.
Then the logger can view the contact details of the profile person and, for example, send messages in his name.
The meeting app made every journalist, politician and participant's phone number public, Foster criticized.
A Conservative Party spokesman apologised for the leak of information.
He said the technical problems have been solved and the app is now operating safely.
The British Information Authority (ICO) supported the data leak.
The app was created by Crown Comms, an Australian company.
The opposition Labour Party criticises that the Conservative Party cannot be trusted on security issues.
The Wall Finland quiz has a large number of clapping Poles in the audience every week
Close-eyed viewers drew attention to the reactions of the studio audience of The Wall Finland quiz show.
The US format The Wall, which has spread rapidly around the world, landed on Nelonen last Saturday as a Finnish version.
The game show, hosted by Heikki Paasonen, is filmed in Poland in the same studio where other international productions of the format are made.
In the Polish studio, the filming possibilities were exceptional, as the format's big 12-metre-high playing wall required space from the farm.
During the start-up period, social media highlighted the programme's studio audience, which was drawn to being Polish.
On Twitter, there was a debate about whether Poles in the studio might understand anything about the game being played in Finnish.
The head of Nelonen's domestic programs, UNNE Sormunen, illuminates the matter for the Evening Journal.
He says that the studio audience includes close to the players, other Finnish expatriates living in Poland and just Polish spectators.
The audience consists of international clappers in Finnish production, just like the audiences of The Wall episodes filmed in the same production space in other countries.
In Finland, too, there are such groups, so-called professional audiences, who go to the filming of different programmes, "Sormunen explains.
He points out that following the game itself is not so opaque, even if you don't understand the language in which it is played.
It is easy to distinguish between red and green balls falling from the wall.
However, for foreign-language speakers, interpreters are present in the studio to carry out the translation work.
There are two interpreters who interpret events as simultaneous interpretation for the studio director all the time.
And the studio director then instructs the audience and tells them what kind of flap is being thrown there, for example, and what the situation is going on, "says Sormunen.
He compares the situation with the way David Hasselhoff was dealt with recently in domestic production.
David Hasselhoff was part of Talent Finland's filming in Finland a few years ago.
She had simultaneous interpretation in her ear all the time and she knew everything that was spoken in Finnish in the photoshoot, the sum of Sormunen.
Typhoon that has broken southern parts of Japan moves towards main islands - authorities warn of landslides and flooding
Authorities are also warning of possible landslides and flooding.
At least 50 people have been injured in typhoon Tram, but authorities say major injuries have been avoided and no deaths are known so far.
On the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so strong that it has turned cars around.
According to the NHK broadcaster, people have been evacuated to shelters, and electricity has been cut off from more than 300,000 households.
More than a thousand flights have been cancelled, and bullet trains are at a standstill in some places due to the storm.
The storm is expected to strike near Osaka around noon Finnish time.
The capital, Tokyo, is not directly on the storm's route, but there will also be heavy winds and rainfall.
Train services have been cancelled today in Tokyo.
According to weather scientists, Trami will torment Japan until Monday.
The sky of aces became even darker
The early days of the aces have been bad.
The sky was already darkened to almost pitch black when the team lost 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1) to Vaasa Sport at home on Saturday.
The Porians now have five consecutive losses, with a total of two points from six rounds.
No Ace defender or two lower-chain player has yet scored.
The pressure is also increasing all the time.
Against Sport, the crowd was already out of the hall when almost half of the game was left.
Six games have only just been played and, of course, there is no reason to give up here.
Of course, you have to be concerned, because that's how poorly we played.
Especially the performance of the second round was disgracefully bad, "Jarno Kärki, who made the power 1 + 2 for Ässi, said.
For Sport, the victory naturally tasted.
The team had a game below from Friday, so you would have thought it would be visible in the making.
Maybe it was visible, but the Aces couldn't take advantage of it.
The number of visitors to Bread Day continued to grow
The mother of Bread Day, Pirkko Hyvärinen, wonders in the grandstand of the big hall about the audience of the event.
Somehow you thought that maybe not so many people would come this year, "Hyvärinen ponders this morning.
In autumn 2017, at the same time as Bread Day, the Finnish Tractor Placement Championships were held, so perhaps it would be expected that the audience could even fall slightly from the previous year.
However, things turned out differently; the corridors were already heavily blocked before ten, vendors reported that the products had run out, more news porridge was sold than before for nearly 500 servings and even in the number of cars Hyvärinen heard there had been a rise.
The estimate of the number of visitors has been about 6000, "Hyvärinen says later in the afternoon.
The five hours of the morning and afternoon accommodated a particularly large number of programmes for families with children, which I think will attract a record number of them.
In addition, Hyvärinen estimates that the event will reach even further afield.
Vendors also curve to Liper every year from a larger area.
This year, almost a hundred rapporteurs, sellers of handicrafts, pastries and harvest products, had arrived at the bread keeper.
The mother of Bread Day, Pirkko Hyvärinen, admired the audience from the hall's grandstand.
At the beginning of the bread day, the harvest was blessed.
In the children's category, Teija Kiviniemi's beautiful bread won the public vote.
11 different forms of bread arrived at the children's bread competition.
The winner of the rye bread competition, Marjatta Vepsäläinen, spent the day in the martens pie workshop.
7 x most beautiful luminaire - here you can recognize a good lamp
Revive the space, create the right atmosphere for the interior and read the book without tiring your eyes.
You should invest in good lighting.
We gathered together three good reasons to invest in lighting.
The tips were given by Tarja Jokiniemi, Sales and Marketing Director of Innolux.
Do a favour to your eyes
Lighting is becoming more important the more years of age are behind it.
Adequate light can help with the problems that many people experience with age, as visual acuity decreases and more and more people suffer from glare.
As we get older, the need for light also grows.
The sixties need light three times more than the twenties.
It is therefore advisable to invest in the nurturing effects of light and the characteristics of the luminaire for health reasons.
A good luminaire gives enough light, but does not dazzle, Jokiniemi tips.
Create beauty around you
The beautiful interior can only be seen with the right lighting solutions.
The decorator of the moment can afford to choose.
There is an elephant-free Japanese style that combines Scandinavian and Japanese.
On the other hand, the modern and playful retro style, inspired by the 70s, with its strong colours, different shades of metal or ice cream colours, has also emerged as a boom.
Authenticity fascinates in the same way as in other home furnishings.
The materials now show wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Express your personality
On the other hand, more is being invested in the home now than before, and the interior has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, you want a tailor-made, bold luminaire for your own home with a story to tell.
People are clearly looking for Finnish and Nordic products whose origin and designer are known.
So let's be very design-conscious, "Jokiniemi says.
You don't necessarily get the latest trend lamp at home, but a timeless classic that has been saved for many years.
Certain kinds of timeless, jewellery-like and elegant classics hold their own year after year, "Jokiniemi says.
Thank you and goodbye!
KooKoo showed the door to the Canadian attacker after three games
The roads of KooKoo and attacker Brendan O'Donnell are parting.
The Canadian attacker played a total of three League games in the orange black with no power points, KooKoo says in his press release.
O'Donnell moved to KooKoho in August on a one-year contract that included a probation period until the end of September.
Last season, the 26-year-old attacker played in the KHL in the Kunlund Red Star ranks and in the KHL Farm in the VHL in KRS Heilongjiang.
O'Donnell's new club is not yet known.
Gamer wants to lead by example in recycling - goods go out to the world in recycling boxes, plastic changed to paper
Game specialist Pelimies now recycles not only games but also packaging materials.
The products of the brick and mortar store customers are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in paper bags made of recycled material.
Products ordered from the online shop are packed in packaging from importers, for example.
All packages that come to us go for reuse.
We may use the boxes a dozen times, as long as the package is in a condition that it can be used, "says Ville Puurula of Pelimies in Oulu.
As a softening material, the company mainly uses newspapers and other similar recycled material.
Bubble plastic is avoided as far as possible.
In the near future, we will also be moving to recycled material in envelopes.
The movement wants to set an example to others.
Recycling is not an extra effort, according to Puurula.
It's not a big problem to start recycling.
There will also be financial savings when, for example, cardboard packaging is reused.
Recycling fits the gamer's activities naturally, as in addition to new products, the shop's key product range includes, among other things, used games and equipment.
The acquisition of every fashion conscious: One and the same shirt works in every outfit
Classic clothes work from season to season in an outfit like an outfit.
With their versatility, they lay the foundations for a good garderob, as it is easy to assemble different outfits around high-quality classics at an affordable price.
In the autumn, the most used classics in the wardrobe are high-quality knitwear.
This category also includes black polo.
A black needle made of natural material with polo collars cannot have an error purchase.
The garment can be combined with straight trousers, tulle skirt and jeans, and you can create both a subdued outfit and a vibrant style around it.
Pooloneule is suitable for both youthful modern dressers and classically sophisticated stylists.
This is how you create style.
The autumn trend look is created by golden brown and wide-legged corduroy trousers, black polo knit and grey ankles.
The classic poloneule, together with other classics, blue-green scotch rose and burgundy loafers, form a feminine and sophisticated outfit.
Bring an edge to the black polo knit by combining it with casual trendy clothing items: A denim skirt, high boots and thick tights.
Youthful and stylish!
Russian intelligence services have a long tradition of sabotage
There is no reason to assume that the Russian Federation's foreign intelligence SVR or military intelligence GRU have abandoned this course of action.
During the Soviet era, so-called DRG groups specialised in sabotage activities.
The name comes from the Russian words diversionno-razvedyvatelnaya gruppa: Sabotage and intelligence group.
The agents of the Soviet Security Service (KGB) in the West prepared detailed plans for important sabotage sites, "says Vasily Mitrohin, archivist who defected to the West of the KGB (1922-2004).
His information was published in Christopher Andrew's books in the late 1990s and early 2000s
The sites included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil refineries and gas pipeline connections.
In Germany, the KGB acquired uniforms and accessories for DRG groups from the Bundeswehr, railways, game guards and road workers for covert operations.
This trike was used by Russian paratroopers in Crimea in February 2014: They dressed in local Ukrainian police riot gear, set up checkpoints on roads from the peninsula to Ukraine and isolated Crimea from its motherland.
Agents from the Cold War era hid packages of supplies with mines, explosives, detonators and messaging equipment in the terrain for sabotage groups.
As recently as 1998, a cache of the KGB was found in Switzerland, which was detonated when it was sprayed with water cannon by the authorities.

Mika Toivola, Director of Sport at Hameenlinna HPK, says that Filip Riska (centre) has been important for the team in starters, under-strength play and in the defensive role of the fourth field.

True story today on TV: Climber left to die twice
American Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on a man's own experiences.
Tonight's film is made on the basis of them.
Everest now premieres on Finnish TV.
In May 1996, a devastating snowstorm surprised climbers on Mount Everest.
Baltasar Kormákur's 2015 guidance tells the story of a survival battle that has been dealt with extensively.
There have been films - and documentaries - about the tragedy before.
True events are also being reviewed in this story.
Twenty-two years ago, the world's tallest mountain took the lives of eight climbers.
Two of them were experienced leaders of the expeditions: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It was Hall who served as a guide for Weathers.
Weathers' life could be saved by eye surgery carried out before leaving for Nepal.
As a result of that and the pressure of the air, he lost his sight, which is why the conquest of the peak had to be missed.
Rob Hall continued his journey and did not return.
However, Weathers' struggle for life and death had only just begun.
As the storm rose, he got lost and could no longer find his way back to the camp.
When the man came to be sought, he was found in such poor condition that survival was not believed.
The Weathers were left to die.
Miraculously, however, he still got to his feet and found the others.
The badly burned Weathers were thought to still be dying and once again were left to their own devices.
What is clear is that, contrary to other expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, even fellow climbers began to believe in the possibility to the extent that he was given help.
In the film Beck Weathers is played by Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
The 200-year-old Eno Church has been celebrated today
The 200-year-old church of Eno has been celebrated today on church hill.
The church was inaugurated on 4 October 1818, and a celebration for the whole family was prepared for Sunday to mark the anniversary.
The festivities began at 10 am on Eno Church Hill at the family fair, after which the Karelian banquet table has been served at Eno Parish Hall.
The church was full.
The family fair was attended by 517 people.
The vicar of Eno, Armi Rautavuori, was glad that so many people had come to the church.
It will be a great joy for a long time to come and will give strength to the work, "says Rautavuori (pictured).
Many have been touched by the fire in the Church of Kiihtelysvaara, and it was not ignored at the 200th anniversary of Eno parish.
Eno Church is now the oldest of the Evangelical Lutheran congregations in Joensuu after the Kiihtelysvaara Church was destroyed by fire.
Kiihtelysvaara wooden church was completed in 1770.
A devotion was held in KIIHTELYSVAARA in the morning to silence and commemorate the church destroyed by the fire.
Photos and videos: The Median flashed his might in Greece - The Sea disappeared and the street turned into a river
A strong hurricane-type autumn storm swept from southwest to Greece on Saturday.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or medic, has been named Zorba.
The Greek Meteorological Institute has issued a red weather warning for the regions of Attica, Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades and Crete.
Photos from the area show plenty of flooding around Greece.
A video posted on Twitter shows how a river has suddenly appeared between houses in the town of Kiato in the Corinthia region, rather than on the street, due to flooding.
Another video shows how the car has been driven by floodwaters.
In the southern part of the Peloponnese peninsula, strong winds caused strong shipping.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens instructs people on its Facebook page to prepare for the storm in Greece.
The Delegation calls for monitoring of weather reports and local authority guidelines.
A Mediterranean hurricane, or median, brings heavy rainfall and even a risk of flooding.
According to CNN, according to one study published in 2011, medians occur only once or twice a year worldwide, typically around September and October, when sea temperatures are still high.
The storm now blowing left a trail of flooding in Tunisia and Libya before continuing its journey north and towards Europe.
There have also been concerns in Greece about refugee camps on islands such as Lesbos.
The thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in the camps have limited access to proper protection.
Areas devastated by wildfires around Athens will also remain under the storm in the summer.
My media also raged in Greece last November.
We should not go to sea now, but flights are still on schedule - thousands of Finns are currently on holiday on the Greek islands threatened by the autumn storm.
Excursions to the sea are cancelled and even when walking, you should be careful not to fly branches or other bulk items on top of the storm.
Such instructions have been distributed by guides to over 3,500 Finns on holiday in Greece via Aurinkomatkat over the weekend.
Instructions will be needed, as even storm Zorbas, which is reaching cyclones, has been predicted to batter the Greek islands this weekend.
For example, near the island of Crete, wind speed can reach up to 45 metres per second in gusts.
The wretchedness of the weather is compounded by heavy rainfall.
Anyone travelling to Greece via Aurinkomatkat and Tui from Finland who has reported their phone number has been warned of high winds by SMS, according to tour operators.
In the air still sun and heat
According to Aurinkomatkat communications expert Inka Ikonen, the worst has been avoided in the resorts by early evening on Saturday.
For example, flights have landed and boarded according to the normal schedule.
Of course, we are monitoring the situation all the time.
Safety ahead of us.
I supported media dispatcher Antonia Schroderus says that their flights have also been running on schedule.
We are in constant contact with our staff at the site.
It was still peaceful, at least in Crete, "he said on Saturday at the beginning of the evening.
The subsidies currently have a total of over 1,500 Finnish passengers on the most popular Greek islands, Rhodes and Crete.
In addition, a few hundred passengers are on holiday in smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm on the island of Kos is likely to reach Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon in Rhodes the sun had splashed and the temperature climbed to 27 degrees, "says Ikonen of Aurinkomatkat.
It is estimated that Zorbas will become the next Turkish nuisance, albeit with some relaxation.
We have already been in contact with Turkey and our staff there, and checked the number of Finns flying to Antalya with subsidies, for example, "says Schroderus.
Shirly Karvinen and Janni Hussi have completely identical evening costumes in the mission finale - this is how they react to the situation
Media personality and fitness beauty Janni Hussi arrived at the Miss Finland final on Saturday in an open-backed evening dress.
Hussi says he acquired the dress from Meslew.
I went into the shop and decided to trust the professionals who found me a great suit for this evening, "Hussi smiles.
The exact same silver evening dress had also been chosen by presenter Shirly Karvinen.
The duo themselves also noticed their similar outfits and looked at the situation with a laugh.
Karvinen told Ilta-Sanomat that he had become busy in the preparations, and he had to put himself on the plane.
Hussi will be a backstage and red carpet presenter in the mission finale, and he will be chatting to the front-row stars arriving.
Huss has a recent move behind him, as he moved from Kamppi to Jätkäsaari on Friday
I am now going to stay there for the time being, let's see what happens.
It is essential that the new apartment has its own study, "Hussi wondered.
Before moving, Hussi went on holiday alone in Greece.
It was wonderful, I was only in the hotel for a week without leaving anywhere.
When the stress erupted, I got the flu, but otherwise the holiday was really successful, "Hussi says.
Shirly Karvinen's behaviour on the plane attracted a lot of attention - garnering the curious eyes of pensioners
Presenter and 2016 Miss Finland Shirly Karvinen said on the red carpet of the Miss Finland finale she had enough to do with radio plots and Love Island Finland filming.
There has been enough haste, so much so that Karvinen arrived to the finals directly from the Finnair flight.
I made up and put my hair on the machine.
This is the glamour.
Changing evening dress at home, Karvinen laughs.
Karvinen says she pulled out her makeup among pensioners.
Indeed, his preparation also attracted the attention of fellow passengers.
I had a big mirror and I saw people's eyes in the mirror.
My makeup was amusing, at least for others.
Karvinen flies to Spain once a week.
In Marbella, he spends about a few days at a time.
Karvinen says she has enjoyed her wash as a host of Love Island Finland.
He describes his experience as also halting so far.
Karvinen says she visited the show's singles on Friday.
It's really brutal in some ways.
They are the genuine feelings of people, "Karvinen describes the feelings of the singles in the program.
How do I wear overknee boots?
Three perfect example costumes
Classic clothes are items of clothing that work from season to season in an outfit like an outfit.
Often classics are decades old, but sometimes even more modern individuals can be accommodated.
The overknee boots that became the hit shoes of the autumn and winter seasons a few years ago have gone nowhere.
As its name suggests, the boots that reach over the knee are repeated in style from year to year and season to season.
Impressive boots share users' opinions, but a bold model is worth trying, well - boldly.
After all, overknee boots are actually suitable for any kind of outfit.
Whether it's a denim, lace, tulle or tricot, the simple leather or artificial leather surface of the boots works.
Long boots look good both in the party look and in everyday outfits.
Black overknee boots are well suited for even tender outfits.
They conveniently balance the femininity of a pink, flowered pliser skirt and a tender, sleek knit.
Fresh but autumnal stylish everyday outfit for romantic tastes.
The strong and slightly retro outfit is created by a long copper brown velvet dress, overknee boots, impressive earrings and a rivet little bag.
While the overknee boots have a certain sophistication, they are also perfect for casual everyday wear, along with a t-shirt, long shorts and a trendy cap.
Wonderfully easy and yet so stylish!
Two robotic cars start operating in Espoo
They will operate for the rest of the year and take passengers on board, the City of Espoo informs.
Otaniemi's robotic cars will play the role of a bus simulator, as traffic in the area is scheduled to start next spring with a robotic bus.
The project will develop and pilot year-round robotic vehicle traffic and test the technical functionality of vehicles in Finnish conditions.
The experiment will show how robotic cars can cope with the current street network.
At the same time, the city offers robotic bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real environment, says traffic management manager Johanna Nyberg.
For the first time, robotic cars travel completely automatically among other traffic without special traffic arrangements.
The safety of vehicles is always the responsibility of the passenger on board.
Vehicles sense their surroundings all the time with several different sensors and assess whether the driveway is free.
If it is not, they will interpret whether the obstacle detected is a vehicle, a bicycle or, for example, a snowflake, "says Harri Santamala, CEO of Sensible 4, which is responsible for developing robotic traffic.
Robotic cars run all autumn three days a week: On Tuesdays from 1pm to 3.30pm, on Wednesdays from 10am to 3pm and on Thursdays from 10am to 3pm.
Robot cars stop at six stops along the route and take passengers on board.
Robotic car stops are identified by stop markings.
The most secure way to get on board is from stop number 1 on Otakaari.

Police monitored hunting in North Karelia and Savo
The Eastern Finland Police Department conducted hunting surveillance on Friday and Saturday with Metsähallitus and the Finnish Game Centre in North Karelia and Ylä-Savo, the police department's wilderness liaison officers reported on social media on Saturday.
The main focus of the controls was on the legality and permissibility of hunting.
Each hunter was checked for a hunting card and a hunting licence required on state land.
In addition, licences for the possession of hunting weapons were checked, as well as the permitted number of cartridges for self-loading weapons used in chicken breeding.
According to police, 112 hunters were checked during the surveillance, and only one hunter who lacked the required hunting licence was found during the surveillance.
The hunter was fined 12 days for unauthorised hunting.
In addition, 133 vehicle drivers were blown away by police and two of them are suspected of drink-driving.
In addition, the patrols dealt with five traffic offences in a fine procedure, police times.
To sum up, hunters comply very well with the authorisation of hunting.
Many hunters were surprised by the surveillance.
One hunter stated that "I've been hunting in the area for 50 years and this was the first time someone has checked permits."
The Eastern Finland Police Department will continue to monitor hunting in the autumn together with other enforcement authorities.
Mykkänen goes to Turkey to monitor the selection of Syrian quota refugees
Minister of the Interior Kai Mykkänen (chef.) will travel to Turkey in the next few days to monitor the selection of quota refugees coming to Finland.
It has been decided to take 530 Syrian refugees from Turkish refugee camps to Finland this year.
Selection trips are usually made a couple of times a year, with representatives from the Finnish Immigration Service, the Ministry of Employment and the Economy and the police.
The delegation is already conducting interviews in Turkey.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) first selects particularly vulnerable people.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered to be in a particularly vulnerable position in refugee camps, such as single-parent families, disabled and sick people, women and children.
More people are elected to the group of those coming to Finland than are in the quota, because in practice some people do not arrive for different reasons.
Mykkänen will also meet Turkish Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu and NGOs on the Syrian border on his trip.
Ilkka Salmi, Secretary General of the Ministry of the Interior, is also on the way.
Talk of increasing the quota
Finland has been taking quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees per year.
The quota was 1,050 per year for a couple of years, but there has since been no agreement in the government to increase it.
The Coalition has been in favour of raising the quota, but the project has most recently fallen in opposition to the blue.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) recently proposed a gradual increase in the quota to between 1 500 and 2 000 people per year.
Mykkänen's visit is the first to be made on the ground by the Minister of the Interior during this term of government to monitor the selection of quota refugees.
The previous interior ministers, Petteri Orpo (chef.) and Paula Risikko (chef.), had time to take up their new duties before the visits could be arranged.
Finland receives EUR 10 000 from the EU for each particularly vulnerable refugee.
Now let's go to the hacks - no longer know whether to cry or laugh
Karjalainen reported last Saturday on a bill to amend the Animal Welfare Act.
The article gave the impression that the bill, as a matter of principle, prohibits the keeping of all animals that are not specifically permitted by ministerial regulations as farm animals, pets or other business activities.
Everything else is therefore prohibited in principle, except for the animals specifically mentioned in the regulation.
If the bill ends up being law, it should mean that we are abandoning the general principle in Western democracies that the law specifically prohibits activities that endanger the safety or good manners of society.
A ban on all activities not specifically authorised by law or regulation is now being introduced as a matter of principle.
This change means that nothing new can be tried in business, for example, and nothing else can be done until the law or regulation that approves it has been adopted.
Government activity in law-making in general has been weak.
If we now go down the road that, by definition, everything in Finland is forbidden, which is not expressly allowed, we no longer know whether to cry or laugh.
I have no doubt that the Animal Welfare Act requires an update.
But a legislative project along these lines is not part of democracy.
Unfortunately, I am not very familiar with the Constitution, but I wonder whether it will accept such a'everything is prohibited, which is not expressly permitted by law or regulation '.
I hope that there will be a sensible minister who will suspend such a legislative project.

Turkey urges to charge mobile phones in case of storm
Storm Zorba, which blew in Greece on Saturday, is expected to move to Turkey on Sunday.
Meteorologists on Saturday specifically warned sailors, fishermen and farmers on the west coast of the country about the Greek storm, writes CNN Türk.
The tropical storm is said to move along the coast from south to north during the day.
Disaster and emergency authorities on Saturday early in the evening urged citizens to charge their mobile phones before the storm and ensure internet access is working so that people can get up-to-date status updates, according to local news agency Anadolu Ajansi.
People have been urged to stay at home and away from windows and move garden furniture out of the way of the wind, for example.
Heavy rain is expected in Turkey and wind is expected to blow 28-33 metres per second.
Greece red weather warning
On Saturday, the Greek Meteorological Service issued a red weather warning for southern Greece for the regions of Attica, Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades and Crete.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and travel agencies organising trips to Greece warned Finns in Greece about storm Zorba.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens also issued a storm warning.
Travellers were advised to follow weather reports and instructions from local authorities.
Not long ago when I contacted you, there the wind was very strong and it was raining.
People were quite calm, communications manager Laura Aaltonen from Tui travel agency told STT on Saturday.
Aaltonen described the situation as similar on Saturday evening.
By the evening, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had also received no messages about Finns in need.
In Greece, ships in several ports did not operate on Saturday, according to local news agency Amna.
Boat trips to the sea were cancelled on Saturday, travel agents told STT.
According to the Finnish Embassy in Athens, temporary disruptions to air and ship traffic were expected.
Finnair was told on Saturday that the weather situation would be actively monitored.
Kimi Räikkönen summed up the reason for Mercedes' superiority over Ferrari
Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen was allowed to admit that the worst rival Mercedes was too hard a piece of Russian gp in time.
However, there is no reason to sink into panic in the Ferrari camp, according to an experienced driver.
They just were faster than us, but there's no huge issue at stake.
Our car was the best in time all weekend so far, but they just were too fast, "said Räikkönen, who drove fourth and clearly missed the Mercedes speed with his team mate Sebastian Vettel.
Ferrari already had a difficult time in the previous race in Singapore.
Raikkonen was asked what was the cause of the sudden fall from the Mercedes ride.
They seem to be going faster than us - that's how simple it is.
If I knew the reason for that, we would probably go at the same rate as them.
However, I know no more than anyone else.
This is perpetual guesswork and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
In time we saw a rare treat for Räikkönen's future stable Sauber.
Charles Leclerc, replacing Raikkonen next season with Ferrari, was seventh, and Marcus Ericsson also reached the final qualifying session.
For the Swedish striker, the 10th starting position is the best in more than three years.
And even though no fewer than five drivers failed to drive at all in the second driving session, the end result was still tasty for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging for Raikkonen for the future?
Yes, if you compare to where they were early in the season, then the step forward has been big.
Next year there will be a different story, so let's see, let's see.
That was it - Robert Helenius knocked out Erkan Teper: "Robbe is back"
The match between Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper in Stuttgart's evening progressed steadily.
The German was a more proactive party in the ring, but he did not get a decent hit.
Helenius, far more far-reaching, controlled the match with his hard sets, which found their way well.
The Finn was also clearly in better physical condition than Teper.
The solution finally came in the eighth period, when Helenius knocked out Teper on his left straight.
The hit was so hard that the villain, who had been playing in front of the home crowd, did not even try to get up from the carpet.
When the victory was confirmed, Helenius blew quite moderately.
In a ring interview, he initially praised the good atmosphere created by the audience and his opponent.
Then he changed his language to Finnish for a moment.
Thank you to all the spectators and Finnish cheers.
We were included in the belt today.
Helenius rejoiced immediately after the match.
It was a really big win for Helenius's career.
There might even be a chance to get to a World Cup match, "Helenius commented to the Evening Journal before the match.
The defeat, on the other hand, might have ended the entire boxing career.
Of course it has come to mind.
This is not going to be any younger, "the 34-year-old Helenius admitted before the Teper encounter.
Number of victims of Indonesia disaster could multiply
According to The Guardian, the country's vice president is calling for provision to be made for a marked rise in the number of victims.
According to the country's vice president, Jusuf Kalla, the total number of victims could reach thousands.
Difficult conditions
Rescuers are searching for the trapped, as well as the dead, in the hardest-hit areas of Sulawesi Island: The port city of Palu, as well as its neighbouring municipality of Donggala.
So far, all the victims are Palu, the situation in Donggala is not yet clear.
Hundreds of people are missing and around 540 have been badly injured.
There are still people in the collapsed buildings who the rescuers have been unable to get out.
For example, a hotel called Roa Roa in Palu has collapsed.
Rescuers say they have heard the cries of people trapped in the rubble, but the lack of clearance equipment has delayed the start of rescue work.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has ordered the army to carry out rescue and clearance work.
There is a need for the army and its equipment, as electricity and communications are cut off in many places in the disaster area.
Fuel reserves are also running out.

Anttikoski thought about his answer for a good while before starting hesitantly.
Thank you for the question, Pirkko-Ella.
The latest book I've read is...., "Anttikoski said, thinking.
The pause for reflection caused a laugh in the audience until Anttikoski continued his response:
The last book I've read is....
I have read books at school!
Probably something to do with economics.
So the last book I've read is the economics of someone, "Anttikoski replied.
After his reply, Anttikoski received loud applause from the audience, accompanied by laughter.
Earlier in the mission tour, Anttikoski attracted attention as she didn't want to pose in underwear because of her principle.

Spoon the rest of the dough over the apple slices.
Cook in the oven at 180 ° C for about an hour until the surface is beautifully brown.
Allow to cool in the pan and then set aside on a serving platter.
Cut the cake until properly cooled.
The cake is fragile in structure and crumbles easily because the dough contains almond and corn flour without gluten.
Ruka will host an international crime literature event in January

According to the festival organizers, the northern location, nature, dark season and the unique surroundings of Kuusamo provide a framework for a unique literary experience.
Status symbols do not attract friends - Four facts about popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic or admired?
Researchers at the University of Sydney, who analysed the issue, have outlined two slightly different types of "coolness": Generally attractive coolness and, in part, contrasting dissident coolness.
Charmingly cool people, according to the researchers "description, had many features considered socially desirable: They were outward-looking, friendly, amicable and competent.
Dissidents, on the other hand, were characterised by distance, independence, rebellion and edge.
They thirsted for experiences and took little notice of outsiders "assessments.
Both types were united by good self-esteem and a stable emotional life.
Kovis' role is not cool in the long run: High status in teenage years does not necessarily lead to success later in life.
This is according to a US study published in the journal Child Development in 2014.
Young people who socialized early, bilked, sought out groups of good-looking people and sought the favor of others had an increased risk of substance abuse and falling into crime as young adults.
In their relationships, they fared less well than their once more discreet peers.
Luxury cars, designer bags or watches that communicate high status do not make a person cool - or at least not a genuinely attractive company.
In a study published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science in August, the vast majority of people were more prepared to make friends with those wearing a regular supermarket shirt than with those wearing a designer shirt - despite the fact that most people chose to wear a designer shirt when they got to know them.
If you are on the Greek holiday islands, watch out!
A cyclone is hitting it - a weather warning is shouting red
During the weekend, as much water can rain in southern Greece as in Finland on average over a six-month period.
Hurricane Zorbas will hit Greece over the weekend.
Be prepared for it if you are staying in the Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Kyklaite or Crete region.
The storm is very strong, so the Finnish Embassy in Athens will announce it on its Facebook page.
According to the Grand Approach, the Greek Meteorological Service has issued a red weather warning for the areas.
The impending storm is also reported on the weather service Foreca's blog.
It says the storm's toughest gusts are up to 45 metres per second.
By comparison, storm Kuisma, which battered Finland at the beginning of the week, blew at its toughest in just over 31 metres per second.
According to the blog, however, the main concern of storm Zorbas is not the wind, but heavy rainfall.
More than 300 millimetres of water could come over the weekend in southern Greece.
This corresponds to about half of Finland's annual rainfall.
The weather service Severe Weather Europa has shared a video of the storm developing on its Facebook page.
Storm Zorbas has caused flooding in Tunisia and Libya earlier this week.
Do you recognize the men's drooling Love Island Suomi -Ankku?
Appearing in confusing Youtube videos
Few people know that in the Love Island Finland series, the beauty Anku, who has been drooled by several men, also appears in bizarre Youtube videos released in 2010 as a craft aunt.
In the videos, Anku advises craftsmen to, among other things, make an octopus from an old kitchen paper roll.
Anku also shows in her sympathetic style how you can work on a hedgehog with the right spikes.
Now let's make the Easter grass grow, but let's do it in a bit of a surprising way, "Anku hints, showcasing sawdust, tights and the seeds of the rye grass from which she makes a hedgehog.
You can watch the videos below or on Anku's Youtube channel here.
Valtteri Bottas was shaking and bursting with adrenaline in Sochi - will he become Hamilton's helper on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas shook a little more tens of minutes after his pole position run by the Russian GP when he was in front of the media.
A great lap left behind Mercedes number one Lewis Hamilton and was certainly mentally important to the Finnish rider, who has also collected criticism this season.
Nice tour.
I do not know what happened to Lewis when he left the round of solutions.
It feels good, I'm still shaking a bit, "Bottas explained.
I've only been on pole once this year, in Austria (midsummer), so quite a bit of time has passed.
This track has been good for me in the past, and I got good laps again.
It's not easy to pass on the Sochi track, so the start plays a particularly big role.
And, of course, Bottas was allowed to respond to the uproar about whether he will drive for victory tomorrow or whether he is facing the jeering of Hamilton, who is approaching the World Cup title.
My starting point for the race is definitely to try to win.
There can be no other goal when you leave the pole, "Bottas piled.
But as a stable we are fighting for both championships.
Lewis' lead over Sebastian Vettel is pretty big and the difference with me is very big, so you have to keep that in mind.
Let's see what happens, however, Bottas completed.
Hamilton was genuinely delighted with Bottas' success after the drive, and the Mercedes stable boss Toto Wolff also had a taste of it.
Lewis had the intention of winning Valtteri, but he failed to stand up.
Valtteri knows he has to tear everything out of himself to beat Lewis.
And he was so charged that adrenaline burst out of his ears, Wolff glowed.
To the question of whether the stable will allow Bottas and Hamilton to drive fairly, Wolff answered, dodging.
We will be discussing tomorrow morning, and we will see how the race goes.
Kiteelainen Erno Kinnunen achieved Finnish Rally Championship
The Finnish Rally Championship series ended rarely.
Hardly ever before have the brothers ended up as Finnish champions at the same time.
Now it was done by Eerik and Henrik Pietarinen in the final rally around Turku and Salo, as Eerik won FRC1 and Henrik SM2.
Erno Kinnunen from Kitee secured the best achievement of his career when the third place in the final race sealed him the Finnish championship in the SM4 class of two-wheel drive cars.
Kinnunen and co-driver Ville Mäkelä, competing at Honda Civic, started the Turku event with composure because the starting points were clear: Placement in the top group would guarantee the Finnish Championship title.
In the darkness of Friday night, the duo had to give smoothing as some of the extra lights failed in the second stage.
There was still a third piece to be sifted pretty blindly.
In a situation like that, you don't fit in with the hogs.
On Saturday we followed the pace of Jussi Tepo, who was only second in the series, "Kinnunen said.
Syria calls on US, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops
Syria's foreign minister is calling on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, Foreign Minister Walid Muallem says foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and unconditionally.
Muallem said that foreign troops are in Syria fighting terrorism, and the war on terrorists, he said, is "almost over."
In his UN speech, Muallem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return home.
However, there is no end to seven years of war.
More than 360 000 people have died in the war.
On Friday, Chancellor Angela Merkel reported in Germany that a meeting on Syria was planned for October, which would be attended by the presidents of France, Russia and Turkey, in addition to her.
Not quite the Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the Supreme Court judge's drama on TV
Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated to the Supreme Court, and Professor Christine Blasey Ford, who accuses him of harassment, got an extraordinary number of people around the screens.
The Supreme Court judge's nomination drama, which is running at full speed in the United States, got at least 20 million people to their televisions on Thursday.
At the time, Kavanaugh, who was appointed by Donald Trump, and Blasey Ford, a California professor who accuses him of harassment, were before the Senate Judiciary Committee to tell their stories.
According to preliminary results, the hearings were followed by a total of 20.4 million viewers on six main channels, namely ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC.
In addition to them, the online consultation was followed by several million more.
NBC reported that 6.8 million people followed the Livestrim and CNN reported that it had set its record for the year with 8.2 million live broadcast launches.
CNN's figure rises to more than 10 million, including those who followed the broadcast via Youtube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital also reached 8.0 million starts.
Digital startups are the channels' own; TV viewing figures come from the research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen will publish the final readings on Monday, but they are soaring anyway.
Few reach 20 million
More than 20 million admissions in the United States are usually only available for sports competitions and the major Oscars and Grammy gala in the entertainment world, as well as occasional political events such as presidential speeches and, in 2016, presidential debates.
There is, of course, some way to go to the US's annual most-watched program, the American Football League's NFL final match at the Super Bowl.
This year, the Super Bowl gathered about 103 million people around the screens for NBC.
Last year, according to Nielsen, Trump's first speech to Congress was watched by a total of nearly 48 million people and the inauguration by more than 30 million people.
Top priority
The appointment of a Supreme Court judge is an extremely important case in the USA, as the posts are for life.
Trump was already able to appoint one new judge when Antonin Scalia passed away in early 2016 and Republicans managed to prevent then-President Barack Obama from appointing a successor to him.
Another seat opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced his retirement this year.
Kennedy was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, but he was, on a number of issues, a so-called scales language whose vote could determine the position of the nine-person court.
He was a supporter of the right to abortion and the rights of sexual minorities, and in 2015, for example, he ruled with his vote that same-sex people were given the right to marry throughout the federal state.
Kavanaugh is far more conservative in his positions.
His election to the Supreme Court may lock up the conservative supremacy of justice for decades.
Children have the right to be informed by parents
Only parents of children under the age of 10 can see their children's health information from the Kanta service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong and it's strange.
Originally, of course, the situation with the Kanta service was even more worrying: Parents were not even able to see the health information or prescriptions of the little ones.
A temporary correction was obtained in autumn 2016 for persons under the age of 10.
Since then, there have been promises to correct practices, but it has taken an astonishing amount of time to correct them.
Now a correction is on the way - in 2020.
Since the problem is clear, changing the legal basis should not have been more than a pass-through.
After that, with the layman's understanding, it is a matter of pressing a button: Now that the pitch is being held, it is being opened.
Of course, a child can show their details to their parents - if they have bank codes or an official ID card.
But how many 10-year-olds have?
The ID card is paid for, and a 10-year-old does not even receive bank codes.
In practice, therefore, no one can see the data of a fourth-grader in a primary school except by asking for it to be printed.
It is not so much the right of parents as the right of children.
It is extremely important for the care of the child that parents can be involved in it.
The right of teenagers to privacy must, of course, be taken care of.
Even minors can have family situations where not all things can be freely talked about.
Often they relate to sexual health, for which free care is a deeply relevant human right.
In the United States, the FBI began peddling accusations of harassment against Kavanaugh
According to US media, the FBI is investigating harassment accusations made by at least two women.
One of the women was before the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this week.
Kavanaugh has denied accusations of alleged sexual harassment during his student days.
Us President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the accusations at the request of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
The investigation shall not take longer than one week.
According to the Washington Post, this is a more limited investigation than a criminal investigation and may not become public.
Man threatened to kill police officers at police station in Kajaani
The attached brawler continued to bulge even in the chamber.
Police say they have put the man in a police jail to "calm down."
Police were threatened by a suspected assailant on Saturday night in Kajaani.
The official informs about the incident, which arose when a good 30-year-old man fiercely challenged a dispute at a central restaurant.
The man first assaulted another customer inside the nutrition shop.
This resulted in removal from the restaurant.
Outside, the fighter attacked another man by pouring him to the ground.
When the third party sought to intervene, the man still beat him, too.
The triple assault led to the police being called.
The patrol caught the man and took him to Kajaani police station, police say.
The suspect continued to behave aggressively at the police station.
The man kicked another policeman in the leg.
He threatened to kill and assault police officers.
Police say they have shoved a man into a police jail to "calm down."
The man is suspected of three assaults and violently resisting an official.
Aid agencies prepare to start work in Sulawesi, Indonesia - "Clean water is the most urgent"
The UN children's agency UNICEF and other international aid organisations are ready to help on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, "says Kirsi Haru, Head of Information at Unicef in Finland.
Rescue work is being led by local authorities, but the need for further assistance is already evident at this stage.
UNICEF operates in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programmes in Indonesia.
In addition to normal operations, UNICEF always has full emergency response capability, "says Haru.
The first task now is to find people in the rubble, both survivors and dead.
In the city of Palu, Sulawesi, rescue operations are under way, but in the Donggala region, a little further north, the situation is less clear.
There are still places where connections do not work.
Relief efforts are difficult because roads are also cut off, says Haru.
Buildings in Sulawesi are often lightweight, so the damage caused by the earthquake and tsunami is great.
Once the survivors have been found, they need shelter - first of all, tents, for example - and clean water.
Clean water is the most urgent in crisis situations.
Firstly, in most cases, people can be offered water purification tablets, which UNICEF also has in stock.
Efforts will be made to repair water systems as soon as possible, but in the event of an emergency, water will be transported first, for example by trucks.
In crisis situations, many children are separated from their parents.
Searching for family members and reuniting families is one part of UNICEF's remit.
Food aid, on the other hand, is organised by the World Food Programme (WFP), which is part of the UN.
In the initial phase, funds previously raised will be used for emergency aid.
However, UNICEF, among others, has already started fundraising to help the victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.
Billionaire Elon Musk quits as chairman of Tesla board - $20 million fine for tweets
Elon Musk, founder of companies that manufacture space rockets and electric cars, avoids fraud charges through an agreement with the U.S. Securities Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk will quit his role as chairman of the board of the electric car company Tesla and agree to a $20 million fine.
Mr Musk is stepping down as part of an agreement he entered into with the US Securities and Markets Authority.
Agreeing with Musk to avoid fraud charges.
The U.S. Securities Commission (SEC) threatened Musk with securities fraud because of tweets he sent in August.
In them, Musk wrote that he was preparing to withdraw the electric car company Tesla from the stock exchange, which caused the company's share price to rise rapidly.
Under the agreement, Musk will not be allowed to chair Tesla's board for three years.
In addition, Tesla must appoint a new "independent member" to its board of directors and take on two "independent directors" in its management team.
Tesla must also set up a committee to oversee musk's communications.
Mr Musk is still allowed to continue as Tesla's CEO.
In addition to musk's personal fines of $20 million, the Tesla company will also have to pay similar fines of 20 million to the financial supervisor.
Tweets misled investors
According to the SEC, musk's tweets misled investors and Tesla shareholders.
Mr Musk claimed he would have secured funding to buy Tesla back from the stock exchange into a private limited liability company.
According to the billionaire's tweets, the company would have been bought off the stock exchange at a share price of $420.
Tesla's share price rose more than ten per cent in a day after the tweets, but fell later.
According to the SEC, musk's claims had no basis whatsoever.
According to the supervisor, he had not actually negotiated the funding he claimed.
He had also not discussed withdrawing from the stock exchange with the rest of the management team or the company's board of directors.
On Friday this week, the price dropped 14 percent when the securities supervisor, the SEC, announced a fraud charge.
Agreement on the news is expected to strengthen the company's course again.
The last judgment is not the reason
The bells of the cathedral naturally do not ring when the wise men do not move.
It is a technical fault.
The bell of the tower of Helsinki Cathedral has stopped.
The wise men point at twelve o'clock.
The situation is like a mediocre horror film: Even when the crypt of the church would sound like a maneuver and the organ would ring on its own.
That, of course, is not the case; the clock has stopped for a technical reason: It has broken.
It has been visited by a repairer, but some part has broken and a new part is expected, "says Suntio Eveliina Jamsen.
At the same time, Jamsen confirms a point already mentioned by the Church in Helsinki Twitter account.
Indeed, the account mentions that the last judgment is not a reason for the clock to stop.
Jamsen says that church bells don't ring because of the fault.
