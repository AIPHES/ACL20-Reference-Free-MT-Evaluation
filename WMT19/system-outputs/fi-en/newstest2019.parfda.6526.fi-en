Us President Donald Trump, the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize - an idea may sound strange to you, but Trump is betting on the basis of coefficients one of the favourites for the prize.
The role of Trump in North Korea at least verbally commit themselves to nuclear disarmament.
Main favourites being nominated for the Nobel Prize for peace on the basis of the coefficients of the South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim jong un, who have met three times already this year and promised to seek peace agreement between their countries.

The good leadership was enough.
Johtamisoppien legend Gary Hamel said that a good leader must have the courage to take the company into the future even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that the decisions are taken by those who are mentally most linked to the decisions of the past.

And that purpose may be just a profit for the owners.

Danger they had informaatioähky.
Good leader calls for a lot.

I wonder, however, whether they were soot under the leaders at the right time.
And their humility was not an easy to assess.

Long-time radio presenter Erkki Pälli is dead
A well-known journalist, Yle Erkki 83-vuotiaana Pälli died of cancer.
Erkki Pälli radio host, 83, has died.
Parantumattomaan he died of liver cancer, which told Facebook pages in March 2018.
Yes this is now.
Doctor, I have spoken it, I live one day at a time, he commented on the situation to Iltalehti a month ago.
Some trade and then security must be guaranteed
I got a story for the first time in 1984.
When these year rings some thing is confused, it is normally the big news.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, on.) retail worker insecurity, I was surprised and at times even a bit angry.
I talked in service of the trade union (PAM) expert Erika Kähärää working environment.
He says that the crime statistics do not tell the real situation.
The problem is growing, although employers, of course, claim otherwise.
The police are clearly only experienced serious cases and many of the violence which go unreported.
"Companies have a responsibility recorded in the near-miss -tilanteensa safety at work on the basis of the law but these statistics are for internal use and their data to collect any", he said.
Mental injuries do not end up in the statistics.
Situations of violence has always been the problem that they will always be no physical injuries.
In spite of psychological trauma can be much more serious than bruising and lacerations.
The difference between the situation of violence and the threat of violence between the situation is difficult to draw when a certain level of aggressive uhkailukin is counted into violence - even though there is no getting to grips with.
Too many fear at work, even though the actual work will not happen.
Some residential areas are restless.
Trade has acquired the guards.
Opening hours of shops with the liberalisation of the media was visible höykytys pretty much of its impact on security vendors.
"Then the time many employers had at least yöaikaisiin guard services, as well as to prevent the work of hours alone", Kähärä commented.
When nothing happens, is a false conclusion.
This seems now to have been a powerful effect, but this will produce a negative trend.
As a result of security disturbances remained well in hand, there was the impression that security would be unnecessary.
Now many places try to look for solutions which could eliminate costly guard services.
Petty assault is the owner of a criminal offence, and it is quite understandable that the seller had abused do not wish to make a request to the criminal investigation, which normally resides near trade.
But the same, in 2011, according to the law), petty assault changes under the Public Prosecutor, if it happens in the workplace.
I think that what is needed is a precedent.
The next time the cousins or setää ill-treatment by the police and the prosecutor should be to blame.
When the right to slay a few pahoinpitelijän in prison, and the verdict from a penalty at the hard to reach, so the siistiytyisivät.
Society where the need to be open about pikkupaikkakunnillakin day and night, must guarantee the safety of the workers.

The ability of children to joint exercises and games also liudentaa distance between adults and children.

Great Koralliriutta starts koralliriutalla corals and fish in living organisms and the regular movement patterns.

Children grow up too quickly - I am happy that my childhood was not smart phones
Contemporary children and young people are increasingly less responsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking at a younger age and younger all the time.
I think children should be children throughout his childhood, not mess up their lives because of drugs and sex, because others tell you to do so.
I was taken aback when my friend told me that was forced to pick up her sister at the weekend in fifth grade to be "boy friend" trust.
When he became intoxicated to pick up her sister, she told the sexual experiences it.
I could possibly imagine your own siskoani in the same situation, as we have been told, and the whole of our childhood varoiteltu that päihteisiin cannot be touched and sex is an adult thing.
I hope that the kids would be able to live a decent childhood and not having to grow up too early because of the pressure created by the group of friends.
I see constantly on Instagram ever younger girls who are highest in face makeup and wearing revealing clothing.
Paljastavien snapchattia is used in the evenings to take photos and posting.
The girls is more difficult to guess at what age they are.
Modern 13 can easily look the age of 18 and vanhemmiltakin.
I was my childhood in the woods playing and playing board games.
I am happy that my childhood was not smart phones.
I got to be a child for many, many years, and did not need to think about what other people think of me.

Video: The dream of a paint saved Liverpool losses in this series
100% Liverpool the Premier League came to an end, but it was still a happier team 1-1-tasapeliin Stamford Bridge.
Sunday, it will be exactly a year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and ran away 1-0-vierasvoittoon.
Pep Guardiolan combination in the Premier League sent a signal that the City was now seriously.
All remember how last season came to an end.
Klopp and the Liverpool manager Jûrgen arrived at the same idea of West London.
The red had started six consecutive Premier League victory.
Liverpool started strongly and, in particular, Virgil van Dijk felt alone in their own end of the field.
Chelsealla below Wednesday was a fine from the league cup win the Anfield Road.
Then Eden Hazard got up from the bench to match with a yksilösuorituksella exchange.
Now Hazard was, of course, immediately alkuminuuteista involved.
25 minutes he balls up first in a small space of a triangle with the game Mateo Kovacicin and Jorginhon.

Hazard drifted a little side of the penalty area, but there was a bet on the rear left corner.
Alisson brassivahti pool was a little slow torjunnassaan and finger than the ball.
Klopp surely felt the loss of lightly as unjust, because almost immediately after Antonio Rüdiger cleaned Mo Salahin maaliviivalta guidance.
In the second period also Chelsea-veskari Kepa got down to business.
Sadio Mané Basque guard reacted quickly to pull on the trigger, and drove the ball into the path of the root kulmapotkuksi.
At the other end, in turn, Alisson reset heittäytymisellään hazardin through while driving.
72. guests the best place for a minute, when James Milner found keskityksellään Bobby Firminon.
Bras with the star, however, bulldozers were the national team mate David Luizia who saved the hosts the lead.
That does not longer 89. minute when Daniel Sturridge got free exchange man shooting at 25 metric.
Sturridge was playing the old kotistadionillaan, and the attacker was to celebrate the irresistible bet at the top.

Clock in the debate are deep in our back garden
I remember when a few decades ago, a newspaper said different from class, which divides the people of Finland.
Juice Leskinen response was the only mind: Nen-pääte.
In the name of some of the family is nen-pääte and some not.
Jakolinjojahan can arise anywhere, and this was one of tarjokas.
Finland has been in the EU at the time of the annual of the clock is being abandoned.
Very many agree that the clocks twice a year of the work has been very short-sighted and caused all kinds of problems.
In the end, this achievement is the solution, at least in Finland the easiest step, even if it has not been easy.
The hardest part is now to solve what time will ultimately be achieved: The current summer or winter time or any other time zones.
Here you can also reach the people saying their opinion otakantaa.fi-sivulla.
Query is opened the Ministry of Transport and Communications, and it is open to Friday on 12 October.
Debate is taking place vigorously coffee tables and on social media, and everyone has a role to play.
Winter time arguing for the morning light effect for human well-being and the summer evening light effect people desire outdoor activities and well-being.
Each position is strong supporters and sound reasoning behind it.
According to morning light rhythms to the day and give good cheer.
On the other hand, if not, in particular, suffered a revival in the dark, increases the luminosity of the movement of people out and provide better opportunities, for example in the autumn of yard work.
The number of additional light after the normal working day is already calculated tunnilleen.
I would preferably both, but bad yes sijainnillemme we are powerless against the northern corner of the planet.
Summers and winters are too dark for many too bright anyway.
Typical of the debate on this subject is that their vision is, and the other view is very drastically.
Not just to listen to the opposing arguments, because the most important thing is what you feel.
Given that almost everyone has a view on this, it is rather pointless to try to turn the heads.
Returns a lot of wasted.
This is terribly difficult debate, because it does not require a great deal of determination and justify mutu-tuntuma is enough.
The types of things usually contested vigorously and equally hedelmättömästi anyway.
Harmittaahan it, if the wrong option will be elected, but I think it adapt.
And always it also offers suitable for a scapegoat, if life seems apealta.

Now go astray - no longer know whether to laugh or to cry
Parsons reported last Saturday, a draft law to amend the law of animal protection.
From the article got the impression that the bill in principle to ban tuotantoeläiminä, pet rodents or otherwise of business of all animals which are specifically not allowed in the ministries.
, everything else is in principle prohibited except for the animals referred to in the Regulation.
If the bill goes into law, it probably means that we are rejecting Western democracies in the general principle that the law expressly prohibits activities that endanger the safety of society, or a good way.
We are to ban all such activity, law or regulation does not give consent separately.
Change is such that nothing new can try on, for example, business or do anything else before its tacit approval of law or regulation has been adopted.
Government action in the preparation of the law in general, has been weak.
If we go down the route of all in Finland is prohibited, in principle, which is specifically not allowed, no longer know whether to laugh or cry.
I have no doubt that the animal protection law would require an update.
But the law in this direction the project is not a democracy.
I do not know, unfortunately, a very well, but I wonder if it would agree to such a "everything is forbidden, as is expressly permitted by law or regulation" procedure.
I hope that there are some reasonable ministers to suspend the progress of the project of such a law.
