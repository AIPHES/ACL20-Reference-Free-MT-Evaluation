Growth Dream Project of Gujarat reached a thousand farmers highcourt against bullet train
The Centre Government 's Dream Project Bullet train has requested a high courtmate against land editing from farmers in Gujarat.
During the application's hearing, 1,000 farmers sought the fact that the state government did not have the right to issue their land.
The Central Government 's challenge to the Chief Justice' s collapsed altimate that the central government would order a court final on 26th day if it did not respond to the land editing.
The High Court and Supreme Court 's claims have also revoked the High Court against the central government that drinks the hole.
There will be further consultation on this on Friday 26th.
In the Interstate Bullet train project, the High Court took over the state government after consulting on Saturday 's behalf of a thousand farmers in 8 districts of Gujarat.
You 're misleading the court.
Your presentation says only 4-7 farmers' businesses have been sold by a large number of farmers.
The Advocate Enjoyment Officer from farmers argued that the central government did not respond to the 1 million 100,000 nation 's most expensive project involving more than one state, even though it didn' t follow the Gika Company 's guideline.
The central government is trying not to respond to a case in the High Court without going forward.
Since the central or state government has no rescue over land editing, farmers are being threatened by a collector as the last weapon.
Black mail is being made to land because of new conditions.
It 's becoming a threat if the land is not edited.
The Supreme Court 's ruling on August 10th did not provide a response to the central government High Court.
As a result, farmers will want to go to Supreme Court again and hold their sentences.
More than 3,000 farmers from the 8 districts of Gujarat will go to Japan to rescue their land, and the Japan International Co.Operation Agency (Jika) will be aware of all the facts about their irregularities with the central government.
The agreement signed by the central government with Gika would be unjustified with farmers if the agreement was to be canceled.
Thousands of crores of rupees have been loaded for bullet trees following a deal with farmers to inform Gika of the bullet trains.
Perta Japan has not yet given more than 300 million claims

Whether the Namaj Islamic scene in the mosque is not the case, Supreme Court 's decision today
On the 1994 decision of the Supreme Court on the rights dispute of the Rama birthplace - the 1994 Supreme Court of the Baburi Masjid Ownership, the Muslim group seeking a rethink of a large pitch is likely to make its decision today by a master.
It 's worth mentioning that the High Court said in a decision that there is no strange part of Islam in the mosque.
According to the News Agency, Chief Judge Deepk Mishra and Judge Ashok Bhushan and Judge S Abdul Najir will confirm his decision on the back of the judge.
The drink kept it safe on July 20.
A royalist in Ayodhya, Ms. Siddik, held talks on this particular decision in the 1994 ruling in the case of Islee Pharukae.
Under which it was said that the monsoon was not known as the designation issued by the followers of Islam.
Siddiq has been sentenced to death and his representation is making his legal successor.

Earth's glass is matched by Tendulkar.

Future speech brought Earth's shadow to Sachin in his first visit
Sachin Tendulkar was also happy to see Earth's start.
Sachin also praised Earth.
Sachin remembered that day when he saw Earth 's cheese batting for the first time and didn' t say anything to take it.
Sachin told me about 10 years ago his friend Jagadish Chawhan told me the Earth 's batting.
Chwahan said: 'This young player wants to meet you and if you can meet him, it' s going to be good.
Sachin took his friend 's word and saw his betting.
Sachin said: 'He still remembers telling his friend that this baby would play a day necessary for India' Sachin said: 'He told his friend that you' re watching the future Indian cricketer.'
Then Sachin 's friend said - are you talking?
On whom Sachin said you remember my word, this baby will play the need for India.
Sachin told Earth 's largest dry
Speaking about the earth 's cheer, Sachin, who sees me, learns (Earth Sha) soon.
It 's different to have talent in any player but what you' re doing is talent, it 's more important.
If you want to succeed in international cricket you need to be a cableliot to learn soon.
Adeptibility (the ability to play from the dependency of situations) is required to play longer in different fields and conditions.
I think Earth has the ability to play from game 's side in different situations and this is the largest freshness of Earth.
Sachin said that Earth's eye hands and eye cordination was a mud.
As it captures the ball 's line and land, many fewer players come to see.
It 's the Natural GIFT of Earth, which isn' t much of these players.

Has the title read shook up?
How can Sultan Mahmud Gazini of the Khalnayak Gazi be the Darbari language Sanskrit of the Somnath Temple and common Indian?
In fact, the University of Delhi 's historian, Professor Shanta Pandey, has emerged from the research that Guzani's royal discourse was liberal.
Currently, when Sri Somnath trusted Do. Gautam Patel and Dr. Manibhai Prajapati for the service of Sanskrit, Sanskrit was only a folk language that was the only language of a number of high-profile brahmins, it was a rare question.
Mumbai 's Pandit Gulam Dastgir Birajdar was remembered.
The 87-year-old Pandit Birajdar, who spoke in a simple Sanskrit as well as Rexhawam, is finally publishing the Sanskrit translation of the Holy Kurran today.
The scripture is written in this scripture.
Ku + Ran means the voice or teaching of the beauty 's religion.
Not only did Solapur's background teach, but today's finger was among the great Sanskrit scholars of the country.
However, Panditji, who spends safe life, does not seek to go to the United States or other countries as a Sanskrit pandit to market itself.
Thailand 's Rajkumari is a Sanskrit pandit.
He learns Sanskrit Achuk himself there.
To learn Sanskrit from America, Utsuko must go to Germany 's Bon University.
Many universities other than Banaras Hindu universities in India are also the Ph.D. of Sanskrit.
In Gujarat, Sanskrit was taught in Gujarati, but was noted in the Sanskrit media at the University of Talshashila and Nalanda.
The Trans-Sanskrit movement in Afghanistan, Pra. Shanta Pandey, has said that Gazi 's Sultan' s Darbari language was not only liberal, but also his own money 's coin was controlled in Sanskrit.
The Pandey has also noted that Kurran's imports were controlled in Sanskrit on "Mahmud Suratran" and that Sanskrit's writing creator Panini was the resident of Shalapur of Afghanistan.
Pandit Nehru has said a huge chapter in "my eye 's vision" of Sanskrit' s language permeability and persistence "has emerged from Afghanistan 's full language culture.
For now, it is widely acknowledged that not only Indian languages, but also Indo-European languages have emerged from Sanskrit.
It is even more surprising that Dr. Babasahib Ambedkar, the head of the Constitution, and several other members of the Muslim and South Indian constitutional council, pointed to Mr. Sanskrit making the country's national language.
On 13 September 1949, when the Constitution was discussed in the Senate about the language of the nation, Sanskrit was foreign minister D.B.V.Keskar and Nuzardin Ahmed among those who spoke nationally.
The day 's debate and the Sanskrit allegation is estimated to have been felt after the publication report in "National Herald" of 11 September 1949.
Unfortunately today we have not decided any national language.
22 Indian languages, including Hindi, Gujarati, Sanskrit, Urdu, stand as a state language (official language) in our Constitution, but are not aligned with national language.
According to the census of 2011, Sanskrit, the country 's only 24,821 people as a mother tongue, is now in the position of just as Shobha' s ganthia.
Nehru Thaki Sanskrit 's majority prime minister, Nehru, also spoke with great respect at the constitutional council about Sanskrit.
In its related chapter of the script, it 's turned to Sanskrit and the world' s scholars have detailed what it 's important to Sanskrit: "In 1874 alone Sir Williams Jones said:" Knowing how ancient the Sanskrit language is, it' s amazingly constructed.
It 's complete, more vipole than Latin and more than both.
Nehru further notes: "I don 't know how often Sanskrit has become a dead language meaning that since he' s voted as a folk language."
Currently, Sanskrit 's speech as a spokeswoman remains the only language of taking shape as members of the central minister' s death as Irani.
We needed to make it alive and folk-speaking again by looking for the years of Sanskrit.
If Israel 's dead language could revive Hibru, Sanskrit remains a lively language.
It 's only if there' s a serious effort to make it a folk language rather than a show or symbolic effort.
Narendra Modi asked who to come with him after he was welcomed on the airport?
Narendra Modi was welcomed to Ahmedabad Airport.
At the time, the leaders, including Rupani, were upstated.
While Narendra Modi was about to go to Anand after a visit with the leaders, Modi called the Victory Rupani to Idaro.
