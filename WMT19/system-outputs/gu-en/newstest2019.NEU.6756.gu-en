A thousand farmers reached the High Court against Bulgaria, the Dream Project of Gujarat's development.
A High Court application has been made against land editing from farmers of Gujarat for the Central Government's Dream Project Bullet Train.
During the application hearing, 1 thousand farmers showed the fact that the state government did not have the right to edit their land.
The Chief Justice's clause gave the central government an ultimatum that the court would order a final if the central government did not submit an answer to land editing at 26m.
The High Court has redacted against the central government that has also scuppered the High Court and the Supreme Court's bills.
Further hearings will take place on September 2nd.
In the Interstate Bullet Train Project, the High Court took up the state government by looking at the settlement of a thousand farmers from 8 districts of Gujarat.
You're leading the court to the gag.
In your presentation, only 4-7 farmers have been read, but a large number of farmers have been identified.
Anand Yadav, an advocate from farmers, argued that the central government did not submit an answer to the country's most expensive project of 1 lakh 10 thousand crore linked to more than one state over the past 3 months, but did not comply with the company's guidelines.
The central government is trying not to proceed with the case in the High Court by not producing a reply.
As the Central or the State Government has no firm defence of land editing, farmers are being threatened by the Collector as the last weapon.
Black mail is being made to confiscate the land because of the new condition.
If the ground doesn't edit, it's the kind of threat that will be seized.
The central government, which ordered the Supreme Court on August 1st, does not submit a reply to the High Court.
As a result, farmers will go back to the Superior Court and ask for their bills to be followed.

Internationally, China tries to make the yuan an international currency at the same level as the euro, yen and pound, including the dollar
Given the prospect of economic sanctions from the United States, India and Russia are looking for possibilities to make the Dec.
International desk: India and Russia have agreed to the S-400 Defense Missile System today amid chants of US sanctions.
Russia's President-elect Vladimir Putin will see the agreement signed with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the second day of his two-day visit to India.
In the way of approving the S-400 Dec, the American dollar for the payment of the deal is set to draw the way between the two countries.
Sources claim that, given the prospect of economic sanctions from the United States, India and Russia are looking for possibilities to make the Dec.
At China's deal, the US engaged in sanctions.
Notably, in September, Russia struck an S-400 missile deal with China.
After the deal, US President-elect Donald Trump decided to impose sanctions on China.
The ban made it almost impossible for China to buy minivans using the American dollar.
During the last few years, however, China tried to raise its currency as an international currency, compared to the dollar.
Since the initiative, internationally, China has been constantly trying to make the yuan the equivalent of the euro, yen and pound, including the dollar.
On the other hand, China has the largest reserves of the American dollar in international trade.
China wants to make the yuan an international currency
The United States could impose a Katsa ban (Countering American Advertising Thru Sections - CAATSA) on this mega defense deal of $5 billion.
Last month, the United States imposed the ban on China buying the S-400 missile system.
India and Russia began establishing alternative arrangements for the deal from that time.
Earlier this month, the American ban on INS Chávez's restitution deal, taken on lease from Russia, led to an estimated $2 billion deal between India and Russia.
The Economic Analyst claims that, in order to come out of such a situation, India should be autonomous by using the ruble exchange as an internal currency.
It is worth mentioning that, so far, all the deficits India has made with Russia have been through the dollar.
Why did America's cuts become law?
President-elect Donald Trump approved the Katsa law in August in light of Russia's modern defense missile system, which the United States has drafted to prevent Russia from working against America's interests at the international level.
Significantly, the United States has framed the law in the light of Russia's activities.
These include seizing Crimea by attacking Ukraine from Russia in 2014, joining the Syria home war and interfering in the 2016 US presidential election.

At the time of repairs to the house, his baseball's wall collapsed.
From here, an Ander Ground city called Darianuku, present in a depth of 280 feet inside the ground, was found.
Its depth was equal to the 18 scale building.
The Ander Ground city was sometimes home to 20,000 people, with preparations for all things from rooms, coachings, schools, churches, mausoleums, vases to vintages.
There are 600 doors to enter the city and get out of here.
There are heavy doors loaded here, to prevent pedestrians from moving into the city of Ander Ground.
Each of its floats can be closed separately.

It is noteworthy that the High Court said in the decision that the prayer in the mosque was not an integral part of Israel.
Chief Justice Deepak Mishra and Justice Ashok Bhushan and Justice S. Abdul Nazir will hear their decision on the back, according to the News Agency.
The Pies secured it on July 20.
Ms Siddiqui, a radical in the Ayodhya case, took this particular conclusion in the 1994 decision of Ms Israel Farooq.
Under which it was said that the mosque was not an integral part of the prayer issued by the followers of Israel.

The Muslim community has argued before the presiding bench of the presiding judge that the High Court's observation in the decision needs to be reconsidered by the backs of the five members.

Reading the title, pounce?
How can the court language of Ghazni Sultan Mahmud Ghazni, the whirlwind of the Somnath temple and the villain of the common Indian, be Sanskrit?
In fact, it has been clear from the research of Shanta Pandey, a historian lecturer at the University of Delhi, that the official language of Ghazni was Sanskrit.
When Mr. Somnath Trust honoured Dr. Gautam Patel and Dr. Manibhai Prajapati for the service of Sanskrit, it was natural that Sanskrit was only the language of the so - called upper - caste Brahmins.
Mumbai's Pandit Ghulam Dastagir Biraj was remembered.
Birajdar, an 87 year old pundit who spoke in a simple culture that can also understand the vacuums, is still finalizing the Sanskrit translation of the Holy Kurran on the eve of publication.
The word holy Kuran is Sanskrit in their eyes.
The sound or perception of the lover on the earth.
Not only did he himself attend the school of Solapura, but he is one of the great Sanskrit scholars in the country.
However, Panditji, who lives a simple life, does not seek to go to the United States or other countries to give lectures as a scholar of culture.
The princess of Thailand is a pundit of culture.
He teaches himself a Sanskrit lesson there.
To learn Sanskrit from the United States, the Uighurs have to go to Bonn University in Germany.
In India, most of the universities except Banaras Hindu University also have a Ph.D. essay of Sanskrit which is written in the language of the state.
In Gujarat, Sanskrit education is given only in Gujarat, but it should be remembered that education in the universities of Takshashila and Nalanda was imparted in Sanskrit medium.
Shanta Pandey, a professor of culture in Afghanistan, says that not only was the court language of Ghazni Sultan Sanskrit, but he has also noted the coins of his own money in Sanskrit.
Pandey also noted that the coins were inscribed on "Mahmud Surat" in Sanskrit, and that Panini, the author of the culture, was a resident of Shalapura in Afghanistan.
In Pandit Nehru's "My Philosophy of Violence," a large chapter in "The Strength and Sustainable Power of the Sanskrit Language," the Pushtu language of the Afghans and Pathans rises from the Sanskrit.
For now, there is a hundred acceptance that not only Indian languages, but also Indo-European languages, have come down from the culture.
One of the more surprising aspects of Dr. Ambedkar 's national influence is that Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, the chief architect of the Constitution, and some other Muslim and South Indian members of the Constituent Assembly, proposed to make Sanskrit the national language of the country.
When the National Language was discussed in the Constituent Assembly on 1st September, 1929, the Deputy Foreign Ministers Dr. B. V. Keskar and Najaruddin Ahmed were among those who proposed the national language to Sanskrit.
In view of the discussion of the day and the report published in the National Herald on 1st September, 1949, there is an estimate of the strength of the Sanskrit language.
Unfortunately, we still haven't been able to determine any nationalities.
22 Indian languages, including Hindi, Gujarati, Sanskrit, Urdu, rank as Official Language in our Constitution, but the National Language Academy is not.
According to the census of the year 2011, Sanskrit is now the mother tongue of only 24,821 people in the country, leaving the culture in a state just like the marijuana of the procession.
Nehru, the prime minister of culture, spoke with great respect about Sanskrit in the Constituent Assembly.
In the relevant chapter of his work, it is written on Sanskrit, and the scholars of the world have explained the importance of Sanskrit: "In the year 1874, Sir Williams Jones said," God knows how ancient the Sanskrit language is, but it is remarkable.
It's fuller than Greek, more abundant than Latin, and more courteous than both.
Nehru further notes: "I do not know how long Sanskrit has become a dead language, that is, since it has become a folk language."
For now, the Sanskrit language has been just the language of praying or swearing by members such as Union Minister Smriti Irani as MP.
We need to create a living and folkloric language by creating a culture.
If Evangelical's dead language can be revived by Hebrew, Sanskrit is still a living language.
Instead of appearing to make it a folk language, it is only if it is seriously tried.
