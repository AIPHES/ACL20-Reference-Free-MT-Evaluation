According to British media, Admiral William Moran, the US Under-Secretary of Naval Operations, says the US continues to focus on the Asia-Pacific region, which the Pentagon has expanded to include the Indian Ocean, Asia and the Pacific, even as the US Navy is reinvigorating its forces to deal with an increasingly worrying Russia on both sides of the Atlantic.
The United States has listed China and Russia as strategic rivals in a new defense strategy announced at the beginning of the year, according to the website of Britain's Jane's Defence Weekly.
Since then, the U.S. Navy has resumed the Second Fleet in order to more directly counter Russian activity.
The moves have raised some questions and concerns among allies and analysts that the U.S. Navy may be moving away from the "Asia-Pacific rebalancing" strategy that marked the Obama administration, the report said.
But Admiral Moran said the U.S. Navy's focus remains on the western Pacific.
"For us, there has been no significant change," he said on January 24, 2018, during a round-table discussion in Washington hosted by the U.S. National Bureau of Asian Research, called "Addressing the Challenges of the High Seas."
"The focus is still on rebalancing, shifting the center of gravity or whatever you want to describe it," Moran said.
He acknowledged, however, that the United States has close ties to Europe.
"We're going to continue to focus on the growth of the West Coast and balance what we can do," he said.
While Moran pointed out that the overall policy on Russia falls within the purview of the U.S. defense secretary, he warned: "The Russians may face demographic and economic challenges, but history proves that if we clash with them, they will be very tough."
Admiral Moran said that as part of the U.S. comeback operation against Russia, China and other competitors, the U.S. Navy is dynamically deploying troops into a "new mode of warfare," which will help keep adversaries unfazed about where U.S. aircraft carrier battle groups or other assets will be deployed at any given time and place.
"We in the Navy and Marine Corps support it -- the concept of unpredictability in combat, not appearing in the same place again and again, almost like a haircut -- which is what we do," he said.
The first to try the new approach was the Harry Truman aircraft carrier battle group, whose early deployment included working visits to the port and patrols in areas that usually only pass through, the report said.
Moran said the U.S. Navy is now working to make sure allies know that the warships will still be patrolling in traditional areas, and is also addressing logistical and family liaison issues for the new deployment process.
Lt. Gen. Michael Noonan, commander of the Royal Australian Navy, also spoke at the event, saying Australian troops could work seamlessly with the U.S. carrier battle group.
The situation will continue as the Royal Australian Navy plans to procure an additional nine frigates equipped with the "Zeus Shield" combat system, he said.
Since October 5, a number of airlines have raised or resumed fuel surcharges and will have to pay more for flights starting on Friday
Yesterday, airlines such as Xiangpeng and Okai announced that, with effect from October 5, 2018 (date of issue), a fuel surcharge of $20 per passenger on domestic routes below 800 km (including) and a fuel surcharge of $30 per passenger on routes above 800 km will be levied on domestic routes.
Xiangpeng Aviation, Okai Aviation and others announced that from October 5, 2018, the standard for charging fuel surcharges for domestic routes below 800 km (including the date of issuance of tickets) will rise from $10 / person to $20 / person, while the standard for charging fuel surcharges for domestic routes above 800 km will rise from $10 / person to $30 / person per passenger.
Children, military and police personnel with disabilities are all $10 / person; infants continue to be exempt.
According to the person-in-charge of the ticket, the airline has indicated in the notice that the fuel surcharge shall be charged on the original date of issue, and the fuel surcharge shall not be refunded in exchange for the passenger ticket.
This means that domestic air fares issued prior to 5 October will not be subject to a new fuel surcharge if they are to be changed beyond 5 October (including).
Since June 5, 2018, Air China, Eastern Airlines, Air China, Shanghai Airlines, Chunqiu Airlines, Shenzhen Airlines, Western Airlines, Okai Airlines and other airlines have resumed charging domestic fuel surcharges, which have been cancelled for three years, at a rate of 10 yuan per person.
This time, Xiangpeng Airlines and Okai Aviation, the first to announce an increase in fuel surcharge, as of the press release, has not yet seen the announcement of the domestic four major airlines to follow up on the adjustment.
It is also understood that the Civil Aviation Department of Hong Kong has stipulated that airlines can decide whether to charge a fuel surcharge on their own from November.
Cathay Pacific announced as early as September 27 that it would lift the fuel surcharge on November 2.
According to Cathay Pacific's website, all tickets issued or re-issued by Cathay Pacific and Cathay Pacific on or after November 2 will include fuel surcharges for long-haul flights to and from Hong Kong and the South-West Pacific, North America, Europe, the Middle East and India, and Africa, with a fuel surcharge of $652 and a charge of $146 for short-haul flights.
The cost applies to all tickets, based on each segment, and includes airfare quotations from all direct-selling channels in Cathay Pacific.
On the eve of the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang met at the Great Hall of the People on Wednesday afternoon with 29 new ambassadors from different countries and regions in China.
Li Keqiang shook hands and had a cordial conversation with all the ambassadors stationed in China.
Li welcomed the ambassadors to China and asked them to convey their sincere greetings and best wishes to the leaders of the countries and people concerned and to the leaders of the relevant institutions.
Li commented positively on the good relations between China and other countries and regions, stressed that China is committed to enhancing bilateral political mutual trust, deepening practical cooperation and strengthening coordination and cooperation in international and regional affairs, and hoped that the ambassadors would take more walks and look at them and make new positive contributions to promoting the development of China's relations with their respective countries and regions in their new posts.
The Chinese Government is ready to facilitate and support the performance of the functions of the envoys.
Li pointed out that China adheres to the road of peaceful development and unswervingly promotes economic globalization.
This year marks the 40th anniversary of China's reform and opening-up, and as the largest developing country in the world, we are ready to achieve common development with other countries in further expanding our opening-up.
Against the background of the rise of protectionism and unilateralism, we are ready to work with all parties to continue to consolidate and strengthen our partnership in accordance with the principles of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit, promote joint development strategies, promote "one-way, one-way" cooperation, work together to safeguard multilateralism and free trade, and build an open world economy, so as to give new impetus to the stable and balanced development of the world economy.

State Councilor and Minister for Foreign Affairs Wang Yi attended the event.
Japan's Yingzhong Commercial on Friday recognized a $1.3 billion impairment loss on its investment in Citic shares in China, taking a writedown on its biggest corporate investment deal because of trade tensions between China and the United States.
A man walks past the headquarters of Pill Red Co., May 2016, in Tokyo, Japan.
He said the trade war hit his US cereal division, Gao Hung, and that it had suspended financial transactions in the agricultural sector.
Japan's heavy-equipment makers, telecoms companies and others have warned of the impact of trade frictions between China and the United States as they announce their latest results, and now they have joined the chorus of trade firms.
The US and China have imposed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of goods, and US President Donald Trump has threatened to extend the tax to more than $500 billion worth of Chinese goods to the US if the dispute is not resolved.
The impact of the trade dispute on China's economy is likely to be greater next year, according to Tsuyoshi Hachimura, Iowa's commercial finance chief.
Ipswich Commercial and Thai Bubee Group invested $10 billion in Citic in 2015 to acquire a 20 per cent stake in the company.
Mr Hachimura said Ipswich Commercial reported a 143.3 billion yen ($1.3 billion) loss on the stake because it believed Citic's share price would not recover in the near future.
Ipswich Commercial maintained its profit forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019, at 500 billion yen.
China imposed a 25 per cent import tariff on US soybeans in July to counter Washington's trade frictions.
"Our grain business has been hit by trade frictions between the US and China," said Yenhong Yonghui, chief financial officer of Pi Hong.
He said Mr. Gao had stopped financial transactions on his account since Sept.
Gao Hung spokesman Pat Burke noted in a statement Friday that the company's move was "in line with internal policy restrictions and due to a lack of market opportunities."
He also said the suspension of financial transactions would not result in fewer jobs.
Pu Hong maintained its annual profit forecast of 230 billion yen, which was supported by pulp and paper and power generation.
Sumitomo Commercial on Thursday reported a 16 per cent rise in profit for the April-September period, stressing that "U.S. trade issues with China have led to an uncertain outlook."
Mitsubishi Commercial on Friday raised its annual profit forecast to record levels due to higher coking coal production and higher prices for commodities such as oil and coal.
Mitsubishi Commercial also announced a new business plan to boost its profit for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 to 900 billion yen ($79.8 billion), up from a forecast of 640 billion yen this year.
The countdown to the US mid-term election vote has been put to a close on November 5, according to a report by the state-run China Daily News.
On November 4, President-elect Trump spoke positively with Democratic opponents to their caucus-goers in a "prodding vote."
Both major parties have pointed out that voter turnout will be the key to shaping the electoral landscape.
In the 48 hours before the US popular vote, Mr Trump was reportedly busy attending the Republican candidate's rally, with former President Barack Obama heading to Indiana to stage a pre-election final appeal for Democratic Senate candidate Joe Donnelly, who is in a tight race for the nomination.
On November 4, Trump took to the platform for Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp in Mayfair, Georgia, to say, "You've got to get to the polls on Tuesday, you've got to vote."
"The contrast in this election is not going to be clearer," said Sen. Marco Rubio (D-Calif.), who is running for president.
The political enthusiasm of voters has risen to a rare peak, with early voting in some states far outpacing usual.
Successive US presidents face their first mid-term elections, and the number of members of Congress of his party tends to decline.
While Democrats' federal House picks remain in the ascendancy, Republicans could benefit from economic assessments and Trump's tight focus on border security, according to a new poll released Thursday by The Washington Post and ABC News.
According to the poll, registered voters prefer Democratic House candidates to Republicans, 50% to 43%, but that's down from a 14-point lead in August.
Another poll, conducted by NBC and The Wall Street Journal, also showed Democrats still leading Republicans by 7 percentage points.
"When people don't tell the truth, when words don't mean anything anymore, there's bound to be bad results," Obama told the crowd at a rally for Senator Donohue, according to the report.
Democracy can't work when people can only lie about themselves.
"The only way to stop these Republicans from behaving right now is with you and your vote," said Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Calif.).
Democrats face their toughest election in decades in the Senate, where Republicans now hold more than half of the 51 seats.
But the House vote is more favorable, and Democrats need to win another 23 seats to take control of the 435-seat House.
Analysts at FiveThirtyEight.com, a forecasting website, predict that Democrats are up to 85 percent likely to win the House.
The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) held an important theoretical seminar on strengthening and improving the work of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). Wang Yang attended and addressed the seminar.
The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) held an important ideological and theoretical seminar on strengthening and improving the work of the CPPCC by the General Secretary of Xi Jinping in Beijing from 29 to 30 March.
Wang Yang, chairman of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), attended the meeting and made a speech.
He stressed that the important thoughts of the Secretary-General of Xi Jinping on strengthening and improving the work of the People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) had spelled out in depth the role of the CPPCC in terms of status, objectives, duties and requirements of practice, and that science had answered a series of major questions of direction, overall significance and strategic importance, and was a powerful ideological weapon to guide the work of the CPPCC in the new era.
We must earnestly study and carry out this important thought, grasp its significance, rich connotation and spiritual essence, work hard at learning and understanding, promote the quality of the work of the CPPCC with theoretical learning and ideological armed force, and effectively take on the new mission of the CPPCC in the new era.
From 29 to 30 September, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) convened in Beijing a seminar of the General Secretary of Xi Jinping on the important ideological and theoretical aspects of strengthening and improving the work of the CPPCC.
Wang pointed out that since the 18th Party Congress, Xi Jinping General Secretary has put forward a series of new ideas on strengthening and improving the work of the People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). For the first time, the CPPCC is an important channel and specialized consultative body for socialist consultation democracy, an important part of the state governance system, an institutional arrangement with Chinese characteristics and the advantages of the new political party system, and a strong emphasis on the correct handling of the political consultation and diversity of the people.
Wang stressed that the CPPCC at all levels should take the theoretical study as an opportunity to further identify the weak points and shortcomings of the CPPCC's work, and work hard to make breakthroughs in strengthening and improving it.
It is necessary to strengthen the Party building in the CPPCC system in an all-round way so as to ensure that the decision-making and deployment of the Central Committee of the CPC are carried out in full in the work of the CPPCC.
It is necessary to strengthen ideological and political leadership, improve the system, procedures and mechanisms for the establishment of public policy and consensus-building on "two-way development", and put ideological and political leadership into practice in all aspects of and throughout the work of carrying out their functions.
It is necessary to focus on the central task of carrying out due diligence, better obey the overall situation of serving the Party and the country, improve the quality of construction, management and administration, and enhance the effectiveness of the performance of the functions.
The CPPCC should strengthen its own construction, take good care of the education and training of its members and cadres, give full play to the basic role of the special committees, and strengthen the basis for the CPPCC to carry out its functions.
We should strengthen guidance on the work of the local CPPCC, give direction, demonstrate and solve difficult problems, and raise the overall level of the work of the CPPCC.
In order to carry out the ideology of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era of Xi Jinping and the spirit of the 19th Congress of the Party, the National CPPCC System began in May to carry out the important ideological study and discussion activities of the Secretary-General of Xi Jinping on strengthening and improving the work of the CPPCC, holding eight regional symposiums and seven expert and academic symposiums, and identifying 18 key subjects and six basic theoretical subjects, with 79.38 million CPPCC members at all levels and 279,000 cadres participating in the study and over 36,000 studies.
Beijing, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Under the current wave of “mass entrepreneurship and innovation, ” more and more technology companies are focusing on patent research and development and related protection efforts, digging deep into the potential value of patents and taking the lead in the market.
In the same way, there are many technology enterprises in patent technology authorization, patent technology use, and so on have encountered a great deal of infringement.
In late 2017, three people from Guangdong Province, Tan Wei, Ho Zhanghong and Lai Bin, filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Beijing Xiaolong Technology Co. Ltd., the developer of the "Drop Travel" APP (hereinafter referred to as Xiaolong Technology), Carrier Drop Travel Technology Co. Ltd., and the seller Guangdong Pacific Internet Information Services Co. Ltd. (Hereinafter referred to as Guangdong Pacific), to the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The plaintiff requested a court order, and the defendant immediately stopped manufacturing, selling, promising to sell, and using the plaintiff's patent acts.
On October 30, 2018, China's network of adjudicative documents published "the first-instance civil adjudication of disputes involving infringement of patent rights between Tan Wei, Ho Zhanghong and Beijing Xiaolong Technology Co. Ltd.," and disclosed the details of some of the cases in which APP was sued for infringement of patent rights.
The plaintiff held that the patent holder and the inventor of the patent "carpooling service system and method based on mobile terminal", and that the whole process of operation of the "tailwind vehicle" application in the "drip ride" APP corresponded to the technical scheme of patent protection, which constituted a patent infringement.
However, in the course of the court's decision, Xiaomi argued that Guangdong Pacific was not a suitable defendant, that it only provided free downloads of the APP "drip trips" on the network, did not implement the patent method involved, did not have direct or indirect infringement, and should not be listed as a defendant in the case.
Secondly, the torts in this case are not in Guangdong.
In accordance with the law, the infringement of the patent in question should be the place where the patent method in question was implemented in its entirety, and therefore the jurisdiction of the court was challenged, requesting that the case be referred to the court of the defendant's domicile, the Beijing Intellectual Property Court.
The Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court held that the defendant, Guangdong Pacific, had provided the alleged infringing drip travel APP products on its network platform and that it was not improper for the plaintiff to list the defendant, Guangdong Pacific, as a defendant.
And the defendant Guangdong Pacific Residence is located in Guangzhou, under the jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The defendant claimed that the case should be referred to the Beijing Intellectual Property Court for trial on insufficient grounds, rejected the defendant's objection to the jurisdiction of the case, and accepted the costs of the jurisdiction challenge.
Other cases have yet to be announced, and reporters will pay close attention to follow-up details of the drip-travel patent infringement case.
Interview with the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Federal Organization for Scientific and Industrial Research: Australia-China cooperation in science and technology has yielded significant results
"With the rapid development of science and technology in China over the past few decades, Australia and China can achieve fruitful results by working hand in hand in the field of science," he said.
Larry Marshall, chief executive of the Australian Federal Organization for Scientific and Industrial Research, said in an interview with the China News Agency in Beijing that cooperation in science and technology in Australia and the United States had been dynamic, from the fight against climate change to the "SkyEye" project.
As the largest national research institution in the Commonwealth of Australia, CSIRO has made a number of world-renowned and innovative research achievements in the fields of oceans, energy, biology, materials and astronomy.
CSIRO has maintained a close partnership with scientific institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
"It's a lasting friendship that embraces a tradition of trust in a partner and long-term cooperation," Marshall said.
In May, China's 500-meter spherical radio telescope, China SkyEye, installed the world's first 19-beam L-band receiver.
The 19-beam feeder receiver, currently the most advanced in the world, has been developed jointly by scientists from China and Australia.
Mr Marshall said the successful development of the receivers was based on the CSIRO's years of technological build-up, with the introduction of FAST cruising speeds five to six times higher, while also expanding more scientific observation targets.
"This is a strength of CSIRO's contribution to the FAST," said a spokesman for the CSIRO.
In addition to the above-mentioned cooperation, CSIRO has worked closely with Chinese scientific institutions in the construction of a square-kilometre array of radio telescopes, the development of new fuel technologies, and energy-saving and emission reduction.
"Scientific research in the past has tended to focus on the problems of the last hundred years, and now more scientific research is needed to solve the problems that lie ahead," he said.
Marshall believes that Australia and China are complementary in the field of scientific development, and that both countries face a series of challenges in their development.
For example, extreme weather is frequent around the world, drought and floods have led to reduced food production and food shortages have severely affected human development.
At the same time, the population explosion, aging, chronic diseases and other problems are also a serious challenge.
"The cooperation between Australia and China in recent years has been focused mainly on solving these current problems," he said.
The International Centre for Marine Research in the Southern Hemisphere, co-founded by CSIRO and the National Laboratory of Marine Science and Technology in Qingdao, focuses on observing the El Niño and La Niña phenomena, studying their relationship with extreme weather and establishing early warning facilities for extreme weather, Marshall said. New varieties of grain developed by CSIRO and the China Academy of Sciences to overcome extreme weather also can alleviate food shortages caused by extreme weather.
"In the current environment, technological innovation is difficult to accomplish on its own, requires very high costs, and there are a lot of problems to be solved, so cooperation is particularly important today," he said.
Mr Marshall said the closer the cooperation, the more likely it would be to make a breakthrough, which is what Australia and China have to do to strengthen their cooperation under the "Belt and Road" framework.
"It is mainly scientific and technological cooperation for us to strengthen bilateral cooperation," he said.
For example, he said, CSIRO has recently developed a gold purification method that does not use cyanide, which is so harmful to the environment that many countries are hoping to find a way to purify gold with little environmental pollution.
"We are very willing to bring this technology into China, which is one of the results of our cooperation in the Belt and Road," he said.
29, 2018 Bao Chicken Silk Road Tourism Promotion and Project Cooperation Conference held in Urumqi, Xinjiang, guests can enjoy local food and experience the local rich historical culture while enjoying the fruits of the development of Bao Chicken.
In the month leading up to the event, Bao Chicken launched a series of tourism promotional activities in eight cities along the Silk Road, including Tianshui, Pingshui, Lanzhou, Yinchuan, Jingyuan, Xining, Zhangye and Hami, thus laying a good foundation for the successful organization of the 2018 Bao Chicken Silk Road Tourism Promotion and Project Cooperation Conference.
Huijin, the mayor of Baoji City in Shaanxi Province, introduced Bao Chicken, which has a long history and strong industrial base, as the second largest city in Shaanxi Province and the sub-central city of Guan Tian Economic Area and Guanzhong Plain city agglomerations, and an important node city along the "Belt and Road" initiative.
In recent years, Baoji City has continuously promoted the five functions of industrial clusters, logistics hubs, integrated services, open highlands and human cohesion, and accelerated the development of catch-up and high-quality development.
At the meeting, the Tourism Development Committee of Baoji City and the Urumqi Tourist Board signed a strategic cooperation agreement on tourism between the two places.
Meanwhile, a number of travel agencies in Xinjiang have signed tourist cooperation agreements with Bao Chicken Tai Shui Chuan Tourist Scenic Area, Famen Temple Buddhist Cultural Scenic Area, Taibai Mountain Tourist Scenic Area and Guanshan Prairie Scenic Area.
"There are some tourism resources in Xinjiang that complement each other," said Chen Hongwei, head of the marketing promotion section of Bao Chicken City Travel Committee. "We have come all the way to Xinjiang to introduce tourism. We have mainly introduced the humanistic treasure chicken, gourmet chicken, natural scenery and so on. We have selected more than 500 photos to make our customers feel the beauty of the chicken."
With a focus on tourism resources, tourism projects and tourism routes, the event promoted the overall image of Bao Chicken tourism, the quality of tourism products and the tourism industry in Xinjiang by broadcasting tourism propaganda films, promoting cultural tourism resources and projects, organizing tourism photography exhibitions, producing publicity exhibitions, distributing publicity materials and docking tourism cooperation exchanges, and so on, and promoting the popularity of the Chinese chicken tourism in the Northwest Territories.
"At this event, all departments at all levels, counties and development zones of Baoji City actively engaged in talks and coordinated the implementation of a large number of good projects and large-scale projects," said Feng Xu, deputy director of the Beijing Merchants Bureau of Bao Chicken City.
So far, 41 projects have been signed, involving a total of 26,043 million yuan.
In recent years, Bao Chicken has continuously promoted the five functions of industrial clusters, logistics hubs, integrated services, open highlands and human cohesion, and accelerated catch-up and high-quality development with the goal of building international cities along the "Belt and Road" initiative, famous cities with equipment and manufacturing industries, famous historical and cultural cities, and happy and liveable cities.
The regional gross domestic product reached 21.8 billion yuan in 2017, an increase of 8.7 percent.
China has been awarded more than 20 national honors, including the National Cultural City, the National Ecological Landscape City and the China Habitat Environmental Award.
As a major town on the New North Road on the Silk Road, Urumqi has a special geographical advantage. Since ancient times, it has been an important link between Tianshan and the North, Xinjiang and the Mainland, China and Central Asia, Western Asia and Europe, and it is an important window for China to open up to the west and to exchange economic and cultural exchanges with other countries, and has a good investment environment.
With the focus on equipment manufacturing, logistics trade and tourism industry, the event has made a great deal of difference in Urumqi with the sincere intention of seeking opportunities for development and co-operation.
At the Conference, local traders in Xinjiang signed six contracts with Bao Chicken Prefecture, involving an amount of Rmb3.25 billion.
On the same day, representatives of the Kyrgyz visa office in Urumqi, the Russian company Novosibirsk Law Ltd., the Tajik Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Urumqi, representatives of the Russian Chamber of Commerce in Tatarstan and other foreign guests attended the conference.
Urumqi Merchants Bureau, Commerce Bureau, Agriculture and Pastoral Bureau, Tourism Bureau and other departments, enterprises and media about 500 people participated in the conference.
The revitalization of the north-east is related to the overall development of the country.
The industrial enterprises in the Northeast are better than the major, the foundation is good, for the Northeast, to grasp innovation is to grasp development, to seek innovation is to seek the future.
Whether the vitality of the old industrial base can be re-energized, released, hold the general secretary's heart.
North Korea's foreign minister, Lee Yung-ho, told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were deepening North Korea's distrust of the United States, and that North Korea could not unilaterally abandon nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Lee said at the U.N. General Assembly that North Korea has taken a "very friendly approach" over the past year, including halting missile and nuclear tests, dismantling nuclear test sites and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we haven't seen any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"If there is no trust in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and in a situation like this, it is impossible for us to give up arms unilaterally first," he said.
While Lee repeated North Korea's complaints about the United States' opposition to "phased" denuclearization, his remarks were of great significance because there was no total rejection of unilateral denuclearization, as North Korea had done before.
Lee referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Trump on June 12, when Kim Jong Un agreed to work toward "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula," and Trump promised to protect North Korea's security.
North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says North Korea must first give up its nuclear weapons.
The United States has also refused to ease its demands for international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'denuclearization first' and ramps up sanctions pressure to achieve its objectives in a high-pressure manner, even refusing to issue a 'declaration of the end of war'," Li said.
"The idea that sanctions can make us kneel and beg for mercy is that people who don't know us are daydreaming," he said.
But the problem is that this continued sanctions is deepening our mistrust, "he said.
Lee did not mention the US president's plans for a second Twenty20 meeting, mentioned earlier this week at the UN.
Instead, he highlighted three meetings between Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon in the past five months, saying: "If the other side of denuclearization is South Korea, not North Korea, then the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will not become so deadlocked."
China has announced a reduction in import tariffs for 1,585 tax purposes from November 1, 2018.
Since the beginning of this year, China has repeatedly taken the initiative to reduce import tariffs.
On May 1, this year, a total of 28 import duties were adjusted to zero for all generic drugs, including anti-cancer drugs, as well as alkaloids with anti-cancer effects, and Chinese-made drugs with actual imports.
At the same time, the value-added tax on the production and import of anti-cancer drugs has been significantly reduced.
On 1 July, taxes were levied on vehicles and spare parts for 218 tax purposes.
After tax, the whole car tax rate in China has been lower than the average in the developing countries, which is in line with the actual Chinese auto industry.
This tax cut will drive industry restructuring and resource optimization, accelerate the winners and losers, help improve the quality of products and services, and is expected to push auto price adjustment to a certain extent, so that consumers can get more benefits.
On 1 July, a tax was levied on the daily consumption of consumer goods for 1,449 tax purposes.
The tax on consumer goods for daily use is closely related to the people's need for a better life.
The tax cut was not only large but also strong, with an average of 56 per cent.
The reduction of taxes on consumer goods for daily use directly benefits consumers and promotes the competitiveness of domestic industries.
On 1 November, a tax will be imposed on 1,585 industrial goods, such as electrical and electrical equipment, spare parts and raw materials, for the purpose of taxation.
An appropriate reduction in import tariffs on some of the much-needed domestic industrial goods would attract more foreign investment, help to increase effective domestic supply and boost industrial upgrading. It would also help enterprises to allocate resources around the world, reduce production costs and reduce pressures on the domestic environment.
The above four self-imposed tax cuts, as well as the third one implemented on July 1 this year as a result of negotiations on expanding the scope of the information technology agreement, will reduce China's total tariff level from 9.8% in the previous year to 7.5%, said the head of the State Council's Customs and Excise Commission.
The adjusted total tariff level is slightly higher than that of the EU, lower than that of most developing countries, and at a moderately low level, basically matching China's status as a developing country and its stage of development.
As one of the important indicators of China's openness in the field of trade in goods, the overall tariff level should be in line with the stage of China's economic development and reflect the characteristics of the times, the person in charge said.
China's trade in goods, the first in the world, already has an economic base for further expansion and opening up, but the quality and benefits of trade development are still different from those of developed economies, and therefore the overall level of tariffs should be reduced as appropriate.
Tariffs are a means of protection against compliance, and their level should be commensurate with industry competitiveness, encourage benign competition, and over-protect against industrial development and quality improvement.
Tariff rates should be adjusted to take into account production needs and consumer demand.
We will focus on reducing the commodity tax rate, which has a high domestic demand and is conducive to the upgrading of the industrial transformation, and strive to increase the import of products with characteristic advantages with a concentrated demand of the people, constantly enhance the sense of acquisition by enterprises and the public, and meet the needs of upgrading the industrial structure and consumption structure.
The strength of tax reduction should be balanced with the affordability of fiscal revenue and industrial development.
It is necessary to coordinate and coordinate the two domestic and foreign markets, the upper and lower levels, production and consumption in the choice of specific tariff-reducing commodities and the extent of tax-lowering, so as to maintain the sound development momentum of China's economy.
The official stressed that this year marks the 40th anniversary of the reform and opening-up, and that China's initiative to reduce the overall level of import tariffs is a major step in line with China's own need to achieve high-quality development, which is conducive to the overall utilization of both international and foreign resources, the promotion of the quality of the domestic supply system and the need for the people's consumption to be upgraded.
This action and initiative shows that China will unswervingly pursue a mutually beneficial and win-win opening-up strategy, firmly support economic globalization, resolutely uphold the principle of free trade and the multilateral trading system with the WTO at its core, and continue to draw the momentum of development from opening up to the world, so that China's development will benefit the world better.
Serbia announces its highest operational status as President of the Republic of Serbia meets tomorrow to discuss the situation in Kosovo
Citing information from the Office of the President of Serbia, it stated that the President of Serbia, Vučić, had ordered the country's armed forces to enter a state of maximum operational readiness, in view of the occupation by the Kosovo Special Forces of access to the lake at the Ghazivoda Hydropower Station in northern Kosovo, which is controlled by the Belgrade side.
On 29 September, the Minister of Defence of Serbia, Vueling, declared that the Serbian army was in full operational readiness.
Vulin stressed that as long as the orders issued by Vučić remain in force, Serbia will continue to monitor the current situation in Kosovo and will respond regardless of the direction in which the events are taking place.
On September 29, Vucic said in an interview that he had briefed the United States and Russia and other parties on the current situation and would travel to Moscow on October 2 to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to seek Putin's support on the Kosovo issue, Russia's Tass news agency reported.
Asked if Serbia needed Russian military support like Syria, Vucic gave a negative answer: "I don't want a major military conflict on our territory."
Vučić also stated that the entry of the army into full operational status was only intended to create a deterrent to the conflict, but that it was also a clear warning that no violence would be tolerated in Kosovo.
The increase in the operational readiness of the Serb army is linked to two major moves by the Kosovo side.
According to the Serbian side, in recent days Albanians have been making extensive arrests in the northern part of Kosovo of ethnic Serbs who have lived there for generations, and these arrested Serbs have not violated any laws.
According to Vučić, since 26 March this year, when the head of the Serbian Government's office in Kosovo and Metohija, Marko Yuri, was beaten and detained by the Kosovo Arab Army, the Albanian community has escalated its regional situation by carrying out inhumane arrests and expulsions of Serbs.
In addition, more than 100 people, including ROSU special forces, armed police and snipers from the recently self-proclaimed Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Kosovo, occupied positions near the water storage lake at the Ghazivoda Hydropower Station, entered ecological and sports centres near the dam in the northern part of the Kosovo region and blocked all nearby roads, which were originally controlled by the Serbian side.
Vučić noted that this military venture in Kosovo was carried out at the instigation of the West, and that the actions of the Kosovo army, without prior notification to the Serbian side, were in violation of chapter IX, paragraph 1, of the Brussels Agreement, as well as of United Nations Security Council resolution 1244 and the military-technical agreement between Séko.
Vucic has spoken to NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, criticizing the West for its disingenuous rhetoric on Kosovo.
The current conflict continues to be rooted in centuries of historical animosity between the two communities in the Kosovo region of Serbia and the Arab Republic.
With regard to the attribution of Kosovo, the Serbs and the Albanians have their own accounts.
Serbia regards Kosovo as the birthplace and cultural cradle of the nation, since Serbia established its most powerful state here in the 12th century, and Albanians moved in large numbers only after the invasion of the Ottoman Empire and the defeat of the Serb army to the north.
The Albanians, for their part, insist that the original tribe of Ilirians, which lived in Kosovo in the 4th-5th century BC, was the ancestor of the Albanians, and that Kosovo has therefore been an Albanian territory since ancient times.
The subjective political division has resulted in violent clashes between different ethnic, religious and cultural groups, resulting in fierce rivalries between Serbs and Albanians in the Kosovo region.
In 1912, Kosovo Albanians first declared the independence of Albania.
After the First World War, a large number of Albanians living in the Balkans moved to Turkey, with a relative increase in the Serb population, which, in the view of the Serbs, “simply took back their own land ”, was pilloried by the Albanians as“ Greater Serbian ”, and the conflict between the two communities intensified.
Kosovo has become a "powder keg" for the Balkans.
In 1999, an armed conflict between Albanian separatists in the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) and the Serbian army and police led to the bombing of the Federal Republic of Serbia and Montenegro by NATO forces and the outbreak of war in Kosovo.
On 17 February 2008, Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia.
Since then, despite reports that Serbia will normalize relations with Kosovo and sign global and legally binding agreements, agreements that are subject to multiple forces, such as the United States and Russia, have not been possible, owing to historical national grievances and geopolitical constraints.
Only a month ago, Vučić, for the first time, explicitly advocated the separation of Serbs from Albanians in Kosovo and the re-opening of the conflict between the two communities.
Power communication still interrupts Indonesia's strong earthquake with tsunami rescue difficulties
According to figures released by the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency in the early hours of Wednesday morning, 420 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Denggara district of central Sulawesi province.
WilemRampangilei, the head of Indonesia's disaster relief agency, said the figure was only a preliminary tally for Palu, the capital of Central Sulawesi province, about 80 kilometers from the epicenter, because of a lack of large search-and-rescue machinery and the lack of search-and-rescue efforts in many of the city's hotels, shopping malls and warehouses damaged by the earthquake.
A bridge damaged by an earthquake and tsunami collapses into several knots on September 29, 2018, local time, in Pa Road, Indonesia.
As a result of the severe damage to electricity and communications facilities, the epicenter of the earthquake, Dungara County, and the neighbouring Siji region, are still "isolated islands" that cannot be reached, and the number of victims cannot be counted.
Indonesian Vice President Kala has said the death toll is in the thousands, according to media reports.
Power outages, communications outages, road closures, damage to airports... strong earthquakes and post-tsunami relief efforts have been difficult.
As a result of the power outage, some hospitals and rescue sites in the city of Palu are required to generate electricity from fuel.
And roads into and out of the city were blocked by landslides and large transport vehicles, including fuel tankers, were inaccessible, straining fuel supplies.
Indonesian Social Minister Agus said emergency relief supplies, such as tents, mattresses, blankets, clothing, food and household kits, from the provinces of South Sulawesi and Gorantaro, which are adjacent to the quake zone, had not yet arrived because of damage to the roads.
Relief materials transported from the capital, Jakarta, are being transported through air transport planes to the affected areas.
In view of the damage caused to the tower and runway at Palu airport during the earthquake, all commercial flights have been suspended for the purpose of ensuring safety and securing relief, and military aircraft carrying relief supplies and personnel only have been taken off and off.
The Indonesian Minister for Political, Legal and Security Affairs, who commanded the rescue in the quake zone, called for the resumption of power supply and commercial airport flight services as soon as possible to ensure that relief agencies, such as hospitals, could operate and that more relief workers, volunteers and aid supplies could reach the disaster-hit areas.
28 (Xinhua) -- Several strong earthquakes occurred in Dungara County, Central Sulawesi Province, Indonesia on Monday, including a magnitude-7.7 earthquake that triggered a tsunami at 17: 02 local time, causing major disasters in the cities of Palu, Dungara County and Xigi.
Beijing, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Beijing has continued to open up the most beautiful blue sky pattern in recent days, drawing thousands of people from Beijing on social platforms to shine a picture of happiness on the screen, saying, "Under the blue sky and white clouds, drunk sky is the best business card in Beijing."
Beijing has welcomed the "bluest sky" since Aug.
Inside the city, people can be seen at any time or anywhere, with a smartphone, or with a single-camera camera.
On social platforms such as Weibo, Weixin and Friends Circle, the Palace Palace, Tiananmen Square, Bird's Nest, alley... All kinds of buildings show different beauty in the blue sky against the backdrop of the sky.
Some netizens said it was the best urban propaganda film in Beijing, while others joked that people with cervical spondylosis could be cured if such a blue sky had long been painted on the screen, adding that they hoped that "the blue could go through the winter and spring, and make the four seasons of the Beijing City skyline blue".
Why do people in Beijing particularly love the blue sky?
People who have lived in the city in the past are suffering from haze, which makes them particularly eager for the blue sky, and the sense of happiness gained in Beijing is particularly significant in the wake of the "Blue Sky Defense War", which continues to improve air quality, with fewer haze and more blue skies.
On the day of the National Day, the weather in Beijing was fine.
As early as 8 a.m., the vast majority of the city's 35 air quality monitoring stations showed "first-class" green.
The "Bluest Sky" themed photography contest on the social platform, which was spontaneous by the public, is still ongoing.
Why is the sky so blue in Beijing in the near future?
In August, the average concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in Beijing was 35 ug / m3, the best record for the same period in nearly five years, according to the head of the Beijing Environmental Protection Agency.
The real-time concentration of PM2.5 in September was even more frequent in the single digits.
A major factor in the emergence of the "bluest sky" is the overall favorable weather conditions in recent years. More importantly, Beijing has consistently pursued air pollution control, pushed ahead with the Clean Air Action Plan over the past five years, and continuously released environmental benefits, reducing total emissions of pollutants in the region, all of which have laid the foundation for continuous improvement in air quality.
Beijing officially released and implemented the Beijing Clean Air Action Plan 2013-2017 in 2013.
Under the plan, officials continue to channel non-capital functions, promote clean energy substitution and reduce pollution, and phase out a total of 4,923 coal-fired boilers.
As a result, Beijing has also become the first large city in mainland China to achieve full-network natural gas conversion.
The data showed that between 2013 and 2017, the average annual concentration of PM2.5 in Beijing decreased by 35.6 percent; the number of days of air quality compliance increased by 50; the number of days of first-class excellence increased by 25; and the total number of days of heavy pollution decreased by 35, with a significant reduction in the incidence of heavy pollution.
While the air quality continues to improve, Beijing issued a three-year action plan in September, based on a new round of PM2.5 sources, to focus on key control areas such as diesel trucks, dust and volatile organic matter, focusing on the current control phase and pollution, optimizing the transportation structure, the energy structure and the land use structure, and strengthening regional co-control, so as to strengthen the city's overall management of the city, so that it will not become the most green.
During the Golden Week of the National Day this year, the city tourism committee, industry and commerce, city administration, public security and other relevant departments will strengthen the law enforcement inspection of the "one-day tour" market, focusing on the "six black" chaos of tourism, and the violators will be given heavier and heavier superimposed penalties in accordance with the law once they are verified.
Yesterday morning, the municipal government convened a special meeting on the illegal "one-day tour", and made the deployment of a special operation to further combat the illegal "one-day tour".
At the meeting, it was revealed that focus on black ticket, black guide, black club, black car, black shop, dark net interest chain interwoven "six black" chaos, the city since July 28 launched the illegal "one-day tour" special operation.
So far, 39 complaints of "one-day tours" have been accepted, down 63 percent year-on-year, and 270 complaints of "one-day tours" have been accepted by the city this year, down 62 percent year-on-year.
In the past two months, the city has seized 248 "black cars", dealt with 158 cases of violation of regulations on passenger travel, shut down shopping "black shops" and 29 exhibition venues, dealt with 13 "black clubs" and 27 "black guides", confiscated 26,000 illegal advertisements, removed 31 billboards for illegal "one-day tours", and imposed a fine of 1.81 million yuan on all personnel involved in illegal activities, and dealt with a total of 1.81 million illegal cases.
As a result, the illegal "one-day tour" disorder is basically contained, and the market order of "one-day tour" appears to be in a stable and positive position.
According to the introduction, in recent years, the city has been increasing its efforts to control the illegal "one-day tour."
In 2016 and 2017, the city's tourism commission handled 1612 complaints and 897 complaints, down 79% and 44% year-on-year respectively, but the illegal "one-day tour" continued to hit and bounce back, creating a "six black" image of the interwoven chain of interests, such as black tickets, black guides, black clubs, black cars, black shops, and black networks.
In particular, the "Black Ticket", the illegal website for the publication of false travel information, the "Black Web", the travel agency engaged in illegal "one-day tours" or an agency or individual not qualified to operate as a travel agent, or the "Black Train", the "black guide", the "black guide", is employed by the "black guide", or "black tourist shop", which provides the "black tourist service", which is used by the "black tourist", which is not licensed, or illegal, or illegal, or illegal, "the passenger, or the passenger, or the passenger, or the passenger, which is the passenger, which is the passenger, or the passenger, which is the person, which is the person, which is the person, or the person, or the person, or the person, or the person, or the person, which is the person, or the person, or the person, or the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, who is the person, the person, the person, who is the person, who is the person, who is the person, who is the person, who is the person, who is the person, who is the person, who is the person, who is the person, who is the person, who is the person, who is the person, who is the person, who is the person, who is the person, the person, who is the person, who is the person, who is the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, who is the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, who is the person, who is the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, who is the person, the person, the person, the person, who is the person, who is the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, who is the person, who is the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, who is the person, who is the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, who is the person, who is the person, who is the person, who is the person, who is the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person, the person,
In the course of this special operation, the city has continuously increased its regular inspection and mobile inspection of illegal "one-day tours", and, in response to the frequent occurrence of illegal "one-day trips" and the high-impact tourist routes, the departments concerned have sent a group of undercover visitors on board daily to make a covert visit, finding evidence of violation of the law and strict investigation in accordance with the law.
Among them, "Black Cars" and "Black Shop" became the focus of two hard-hitting special operations.
According to the report, without the black car, the illegal "one-day trip" will not be possible, and the black car is easy to be found, remembered and investigated, as well as a fixed asset with a high individual value.
Related departments use road traffic surveillance probe to increase supervision of the key "one-day tour" line tourism bus, using technical and physical protection and other scientific and intelligent means to detect and deal with the "black car" in a timely manner.
Travel shopping "black shop" because of the number of small, sit-down operation, also became the focus of the Strictly.
In order to strengthen the deterrent and crackdown on illegal "one-day tours", all functional departments shall, in accordance with the law, impose heavier and heavier superimposed penalties on those who have been found to have violated the laws and regulations in the special operations.
In August this year, the city also held a seminar on the legal issues related to the illegal "one-day tour," and discussed measures for combining administrative penalty with conviction.
The city's tourism committee said it would encourage more regular travel agencies to carry out "one-day tours" in Beijing and increase the supply of regular "one-day tours" to further squeeze out the living space of illegal "one-day tours," and that specific plans were still under study.
In addition, the Municipal Tourist Committee has continuously improved the electronic travel list information system for tour groups to ensure that each team is included in the monitoring of the electronic travel list platform.
From a tourist symbol to a digital economy symbol, what Wuzhen has gone through these years
As the permanent venue of the World Internet Congress, Wuzhen has been paid much attention to how to take on the dividends of the Summit.
Beginning with the first World Internet Congress, the changes in Wuzhen have been visible over the past five years.
In 2014, the town had just 12 businesses linked to the digital economy, the internet, and by the third quarter of this year, there had been more than 500.
This is a microcosm of Wuzhen's development of the digital economy.
With the convening of the Internet conference, local enterprises can be inspired by the digital economy and the digital wave at zero distance, the desire for enterprise transformation and upgrading is strong, and traditional manufacturing enterprises have increased their investment and research and development in machine exchange, intelligent management and so on.
Mr. Jiang Wei, party secretary of Wuzhen, said the town will build a new economic empowerment center in the future.
The development of the digital economy cannot be supported by infrastructure.
This year, Wuzhen launched a 5G pilot based on full coverage of its 4G communications network and free WiFi.
At the same time, Tongxiang City, where Wuzhen is located, is the first county-level city in China to build a dedicated Internet data channel, and it has also become a hot land for the development of Internet industry.
Since the first World Internet Congress, Tongxiang has introduced 565 digital economic projects, with a total planned investment of 377.25 billion yuan. In the first three quarters of this year, the core manufacturing sector of the digital economy achieved a total output value of 8.73 billion yuan, an increase of 13 percent year-on-year in value added.
"Wuzhen was a tourist symbol before, and later a theatrical and cultural symbol. Because of the Internet Congress, it is now a symbol of the Internet and the digital economy," he said.
As the dividends of the World Internet Congress accumulate over time, it is also necessary to set up a platform to accept the superimposed import of talents, projects, technologies and other elements, said Cheng Yung Jun, the secretary of Tongxiang Municipal Committee.
Tongxiang people Shen Yi worked outside for 20 years, because of the Internet conference tie-up, returned home to start a business.
On December 2 last year, with a high-volume tamper-proof digital technology solution, he walked into the fourth Internet Light Expo, which was popular with multiple customers.
Shen Yi chose to start a business in Wuzhen not only because of the hometown complex, "in Wuzhen, it is easier to recruit people than I thought, our application also falls fast, Wuzhen smart parking project has our application."
A Wuzhen Boulevard, showing the spillover effect of the Internet Congress.
This thoroughfare, which runs through the north and south of Tongxiang, is not only a tourist attraction but also an industrial thoroughfare.
With it as the foundation, Wuzhen Boulevard Kosheng agglomeration area came into being.
The reporter understands that in the future, Wuzhen Avenue will be the main position for the development of Tongxiang industry, taking the lead in applying a large number of wisdom medical care, wisdom old-age, intelligent government, and so on, gathering 80% of the city's GDPP industry and a large number of high-level talents.
At least 410 people have been killed by a tsunami triggered by a strong earthquake in Indonesia
The earthquake in the central province of Sulawesi has killed 410 people, 97 of whom have been identified, the head of Indonesia's Jakarta police's public information bureau said on the evening.
Another 29 people were missing and 540 were injured.
The Palu airport remains closed for the time being.
With positive treatment, the survival rate of premature babies aged 29 weeks and above in China reached 98 percent, reaching the level of developed countries.
Shanghai, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The National Children's Medical Center, a subsidiary of Fudan University, has revealed that it has introduced Canada's advanced methods in its leading project on the improvement of the quality of the prognosis of premature infants in NICU hospitals.
The results showed that the survival rate of premature babies aged 29 weeks and above in China reached 98 per cent after active treatment, reaching the level of developed countries, but there was still much room for improvement in the survival rate of premature infants and premature infants without complications at very small gestation ages.
For nearly 20 years, the Chinese government has been paying attention to the treatment of newborn babies.
At present, the infant mortality rate in the Shanghai area has fallen to 3.71 per thousand, significantly below the national average and reaching the advanced level of the developed countries.
"NICU project to improve the quality of the prognosis of premature infants in hospital" has greatly improved the quality of life of premature babies through four years of unremitting efforts.
Professor Cao Yun, director of the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at Fudan University Hospital, told reporters that while improving the survival rate of premature babies, focusing on reducing the quality of premature babies, reducing the incidence of complications, improving the prognosis of neurological development and improving the overall outcome of children are important for improving the overall quality of survival and the quality of the population of premature babies, and are also important issues of concern to the pediatric and neonatal departments at home and abroad.
Through four years of unremitting efforts, NICU has recorded tens of thousands of premature babies aged 33 weeks and below, resulting in a decrease of 1 / 3 in the mortality rate of premature infants of small birth age and small birth weight, and a significant decrease in the incidence of serious complications in premature babies, which has greatly improved the quality of life of premature babies.
Through the establishment of a national network for the improvement of the quality of newborns and the introduction of the concept of collaborative quality improvement, 25 cooperative hospitals throughout China have been set up to develop a comprehensive, systematic and effective collaborative quality improvement method for improving the prognosis of premature babies and improving the level of treatment for newborns, which is appropriate to the domestic conditions.
The Fudan University Hospital for Pediatrics is working with the National Neonatal Unit to develop guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections, based on the experience gained in the project, so as to provide reference and guidance for the standard diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections in China.
It is understood that in a project to improve the quality of the prognosis of premature babies in China, paediatric hospitals have introduced the EPIQ method to 25 large NICU units in 19 provinces across the country, working to address the infection of premature babies that is plaguing China's neonatal care units.
After more than 10 years of continuous improvement, the survival rate of premature babies in Canada has increased by about one-third, and Canada is now one of the world's best predictors of premature births.
The EPIQ method has now been applied to all NICU across Canada and has been adopted by six countries.
The pediatric hospital revealed that two years after the EPIQ intervention, infection in premature babies fell by 35 per cent, while antibiotic use dropped by 20 per cent.
In the future, Fudan University-affiliated paediatric hospitals will continue to promote and implement this approach throughout the country, with a view to comprehensively reducing the incidence of all complications in premature babies and improving the quality of care for newborns throughout the country.
At present, it is an indisputable fact that there are differences and asymmetries in the level of treatment in all regions of China.
As an important construction unit of the National Children's Medical Center, the pediatric hospital will play a leading role in radiation, according to Professor Cao Yun. The study covers several western provinces, including Xinjiang, Guizhou, Gansu and Shaanxi, with a view to gradually promoting the homogenization and standardization of neonatal treatment throughout the country.
It is understood that Fudan University's affiliated paediatric hospital is working with the National Neonatal Unit to develop guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections, based on the accumulated experience of the project, so as to provide reference and guidance for the standard diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections in China.
In 2019, the focal point, a network of Chinese neonicotinoids affiliated with Fudan University's pediatric hospital, will join 63 hospitals across the country to carry out the next phase of national quality improvement, with a view to promoting the development of a homogenous level of neonatal care in China, according to the report.
'Shanghai can become a central city in Asia, not only in research, but also in the construction of the entire service system. The quality of services and the results of these services should have a place in Asia, so as to truly reflect the level of medical care in China, 'said Wu Xilui, director of the Shanghai Health and Health Planning Commission.
Sinn Féin: Build the "Hero Monument" in the heart - written on the fifth Martyrs' Day.
On September 30, on the eve of the Republic's 69-year-old anniversary, we welcomed the fifth anniversary of the martyrs, and Xi Jinping and other leaders of the Party and the state came to Tian'anmen Square to attend a ceremony to lay flowers and baskets for the heroes of the people.
At this moment, no matter where you are, please pay tribute to Inverness.
Remembrance Day is a relic and a wake-up call.
Turning over a heavy history, behind the names of every martyr, is a living life.
They, too, have fiery youth, sincere love, and a concerned family.
However, because of their conviction that "the doctrine of our faith is the truth of the universe", they are willing to sacrifice everything for the sake of "exonerating the suffering of the next generation."
"I'm going to cry for China one day."
Through time and time, the Inverness set up a spiritual signpost to guide the way forward.
"Where to come from, where to go" "what kind of person to be," read Inverness, it's not hard to come up with an answer.
In memory of Inverness, the most important thing is to build a "monument to heroes" in the heart.
According to incomplete statistics, since the Revolutionary War, some 20 million martyrs have dedicated their lives to national independence, the liberation of the people and the prosperity of the country.
For a variety of reasons, many pioneers don't even leave names.
Countless Inverness watered their ideals with blood, practiced their faith with life, remembered their name, and carried on their spirit, which is to guard the roots and spirits of the nation.
This "Hero Monument" does not allow any defilement or destruction.
For some time now, the dark currents of historical nihilism, pan-entertainment and so on have surged.
All kinds of distortions of history, derogatory practices, challenges to the conscience of justice, deranged value judgment, aroused the public anger and vigilance of the whole society.
There is no sacrilege in English, no hero can forget.
The act of touching the bottom line cannot be left unattended, must dare to shine the sword, with the rule of law and justice to defend the dignity of the British.
On May 1 this year, the Hero Martyrs Protection Act came into force.
From the point of view of judicial practice, the judgment of some cases is popular, which not only protects the glorious image of England effectively according to law, but also frees up the positive energy of respecting heroes and admiring the spirit of the first.
A nation that has aspirations cannot be without heroes, a nation that has ideals cannot be without pioneers.
It has become a universal social consensus to remember the first and call for the hero.
At present, there are millions of memorial facilities throughout the country, and more than 100 million visits are made to the Martyrs' Garden each year.
The heart is the strongest building block.
Let the worship of heroes, the defense of heroes, the learning of heroes, and the love of heroes become popular, so that the spirit of English will be integrated into the national blood, a "monument of heroes" will stand standing between the earth and the earth, the heart of the heart.
Brussels, September 28 (Xinhua) -- After Italy defied European Union demands to surprise markets with a massive budget deficit plan, the European Union on Friday took a non-confrontational stance against Italy, but it may take a more radical stance if it sticks to too bold a goal.
Italy ’ s Eurosceptic government is aiming for a budget deficit of 2.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) over the next three years, indicating that debt cuts have not yet been made in the face of austerity demands alone.
"We have no interest in the crisis between the ExCom and Italy," Moss Vessey, the European Commission's economic affairs chief, said on Friday, in a cautious response given that EU proposals and sanctions may have little impact on Italy.
EU officials and diplomats still hope that market forces will be able to persuade Italy to adjust its budget plan before it is formally presented to the European Commission in mid-October.
After the government announced its plan, the euro fell to its lowest level in nearly two weeks on Friday, and Italian bond yields hit their highest level in three weeks.
If the deficit target remains unchanged by the October deadline, the European Commission may veto Italy's draft budget, something it has never done to any country.
Speaking later on Friday at a meeting in the Latvian capital Riga, the vice-president of the European Commission said Italy's current fiscal plan "appears to be at odds with the stability and growth pact," referring to the EU's fiscal rules.
But he did not say how that would trigger a reaction from the EU.
Tenderers may submit their applications for participation in the public tender by 26 October this year.
Previously, the Russian Ministry of Agriculture had made China one of the priority markets for Russian agricultural exports.
In May, the Russian Agricultural Supervisory Authority announced that for the first time in this agricultural year, Russia's grain exports to China exceeded 1 million tons, a record.
The bureau predicts China could be among the top 10 food-importing countries in Russia.
Sapporo, China, September 30 (UPI) -- After a 3-0 victory over Cuba, the Chinese women's volleyball team won another 3-0 victory over Turkey in the 2018 World Championships in a two-match series.
But compared with the first battle, the Chinese women's volleyball team this service is more difficult.
There are 24 teams participating in the 2018 Women's Volleyball World Championships, with the Chinese women's volleyball team in Group B with Italy, Turkey, Bulgaria, Canada and Cuba.
In terms of the world rankings and the overall strength of the teams in Group B, the Turkish and Italian teams are the main opponents of the Chinese team.
After the start of the day, the Chinese team came into the game relatively quickly and took the lead in the opening set, keeping the advantage throughout, putting a lot of pressure on both the serve and the block, and taking the first set with 25: 18 to go.
At the end of the second set, the Turkish team had a strong serve and started the game with a 6: 2 lead, the Chinese team had to be suspended and adjusted to a 7-0 tie, and then had to score a game-high 7: 0; the Turkish team at the end of the game had to score 15: 19; the Chinese team had a 24: 20 lead, and the Chinese team had to go for a second.
In the third game, the situation was very good, the score of the two sides rose alternately, at one point into a 19-match tie.
At the crucial moment, the Turkish team made a mistake, China took the lead with 21: 19, and with Zhu Ting's effort and Zhang Changning's attack won the match with 24: 21; then Turkey took the score to 23: 24, after China requested a timeout, Zhang Changning scored, and China held on for a 25: 23 victory.
China women's volleyball head coach Lang Ping admitted after the game that the whole game was not easy.
"We are better prepared, we are good at blocking and the Turkish team is more technical, and we have to reduce our mistakes and try to win by scoring on our own initiative."
Faced with a familiar team-mate, Zhu Ting, who played for Turkey's Wakiver Bank team, was limited in the first game of the day, and then she took the initiative to change, still playing a strong attack.
"We know each other well and it is normal to be watched and defended by our opponents, but the Chinese team played extremely well, blocking and attacking in a bad situation," he said.
Next, the Chinese women's volleyball team will hold a one-day truce for physical and technical training; on October 2, it will face its third opponent, Canada, in the group stage.

Nearly 1,000 state-owned scenic spots cut ticket prices by more than half by more than 20 per cent
By September 28, 981 scenic areas had been opened or reduced free of charge (74 free of charge and 907 at a reduced price). In Yunnan, Shilin, Dali, Yulong Mountain, Guangxi, Lijiang River, Fujian Wuyi Mountain, Hunan Zhangjiajie, Shaanxi Terracotta Warrior, Jiangxi and Xinjiang, all had reduced their prices.
In order to implement the decision-making and deployment of the Central Economic Work Conference and the Government Work Report, the National Development Reform Commission issued on June 28 the Guidance on Improving the Mechanism for the Establishment of Ticket Prices in State-owned Scenic Areas (hereinafter referred to as the Guidance), which calls for a reasonable definition of the composition of ticket pricing costs, innovative price management methods and strict implementation of pricing procedures, so as to ensure that state-owned area ticket prices become more effective at the end of September.
In accordance with the requirements of deployment, all localities have made active efforts to reduce the ticket prices of a number of key state-owned scenic spots.
As at 28 September, 981 scenic areas (74 free and 907 at a reduced price) had been put in place or advertised to the public, of which 159 were at level 5A and 534 at level 4A, with a combined total of 693, or 70.6 per cent.
Of the 907 sites that were cut, 491, or 54.3 per cent, were down by more than 20 per cent, and 214, or 23.6 per cent, were down by more than 30 per cent.
In Yunnan, Shandong, Guangxi and Shaanxi provinces, the number of cut-price scenic areas is higher, with the number of cut-price scenic areas in Yunnan exceeding 100, and the overall decrease is more than 30%.
Anhui, Chongqing and other eight provinces (district, city) government pricing 5A level scenic areas to achieve a full reduction in prices.
High social attention has been paid to Yunnan Shiling, Dali Three Towers, Yulong Snow Mountain, Guangxi Guilin Lijiang, Fujian Wuyi Mountain, Hunan Zhangjiajie, Shaanxi Terracotta Warriors, Jiangxi Sanqing Mountain, Xinjiang Kanas and other scenic areas have implemented price reduction.
The gradual return of ticket prices in key state-owned scenic areas to a reasonable range is conducive to accelerating the transformation of tourism from the ticket economy to the industrial economy, small-scale tourism to mass tourism and tourist attractions to tourism in the whole region, and is conducive to forming a virtuous circle of optimizing the tourism supply structure and steadily expanding the demand for tourism consumption, so as to promote the sustainable and healthy development of the scenic areas and tourism industries.
At the same time, the National Development and Reform Commission stressed that all localities should strengthen the price order of scenic areas and guide them to upgrade their services so as to ensure that prices are not reduced and quality is not reduced.
In addition, the National Development Reform Commission (NDRC) has carried out special inspections on the recent media reports on such issues as the reduction of ticket prices in individual scenic areas, the reduction of prices, the reduction of prices, and the reduction of prices in real terms, and the need to address the concerns of the community in a timely manner.
Trade Promotion Bureau to carry out short-term and medium-term optimization work in an orderly manner
The Macao Trade and Investment Promotion Bureau has submitted a report on the short-term and long-term optimization of "major investment migrants" and "skilled migrants". In addition to stepping up and implementing the work contained in the report, it has been continuously listening to the views of the community and optimizing the content of the report and related work.
The TDC will make an introduction to all sectors of the community as soon as possible on the related optimization work.
Of these, 5 are short-term measures to be implemented during the year; 5 are medium-term measures to be implemented in 2019; and 1 is a long-term measure.
In addition, the Trade and Development Bureau has carried out a comprehensive review of the internal management system, as instructed by the Financial Secretary for the Economy, Mr Leung Witt.
The five short-term measures implemented during this year include:
1. To carry out the review exercise. Priority will be given to cases that are about to expire in seven years, those referred to in the ICAC report, and new cases that have been renewed. If cases of misconduct or signs of violation are found, they will be referred on their own initiative to the relevant judicial authorities for follow-up;
2. On-site inspections of projects involving "major investment migrants". By late September, more than 20 investment projects had been inspected;
3. To conduct a comprehensive review of the current evaluation system. Six principles for the analysis of investment projects have been re-established in the evaluation of applications for "major investment migration". In the evaluation of applications for "skilled migration", the approval mechanism will be improved by identifying the elements conducive to the development of Australia and the conditions for the priority recruitment of talent. A list of the "Five Sectors of Work" has been established for the annual priority recruitment of talent. The Government will be more responsive to the process.
4. Increasing the transparency of information, including the planned gradual publication of approval criteria, rating criteria and weights, and further refinement and disclosure of approval data, starting from the fourth quarter of this year;
5. With regard to the improvement of the validation mechanism, prior verification of work in Australia has been requested; significant investments must be checked on site and the financial statements submitted.
The five medium-term measures to be implemented in 2019 include:
1. Establish a mechanism for hearing the views of the Talent Development Committee and the Economic Development Committee on a regular basis. Among these, a working meeting was held with the Economic Development Committee in September to discuss the establishment of the mechanism.
2. Requires the applicant to submit annually financial statements prepared by an independent third party in order to keep under review the operation of the investment project;
3. Further standardize and electronically process the application and approval of individual cases in order to reduce human error;
4. To conduct a comprehensive review of the current staffing situation, in line with the implementation of a number of optimization measures;
5. To intensify the study on the revision of the Temporary Residence System for Investors, Managers and Technicians with Special Qualifications.
With regard to the long-term measures, it is expected that the drafting of the legislation will be completed as soon as possible in the first half of 2019. The criteria for granting temporary residence permits, the review mechanism and the confirmation mechanism will be further clarified, and the investigation function of the Trade and Development Bureau will be expanded to allow for more precise approval and supervision of applications for temporary residence permits.
The experts of the national non-film cotton field observation and discussion exchange activities went into the experimental field to hear a presentation by the representative of the Chinese Academy of Engineering's academician team.
Shaya, Xinjiang, Sept. 30 (Gengdan Wang Xiaojun) In Shaya County, Xinjiang, an experimental base for the cultivation of film-free cotton, a cluster of snow-white cotton is "open" and full of branches, compared with the surrounding cotton film.
From September 27 to 28, the national non-film cotton field observation and discussion exchange activities were held in Shaya County, Xinjiang.
At the meeting, the reporter learned that the non-film cotton technology system, which takes "Chinese cotton 619" and its supporting cultivation measures as its main part, has achieved the goal of impregnating cotton fields, reducing the pollution of the ecological environment and raw cotton from the remnant film in Xinjiang, and making great progress in the research and demonstration of the comprehensive cotton film technology.
Academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, renowned cotton genetic breeders and chief scientist of the cotton system of the country's modern agricultural industry technical system, Wang Shuxun, introduced the growth of film-free cotton to Zhou Guojie, secretary of the Communist Party of Zhejiang University of Agriculture and Agriculture.
"Our comprehensive technology of film-free cotton can be fully realized, and the problem of residual membrane contamination can be solved completely, and green cotton planting can be realized."
The academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering is introduced by Shu Xun.
Xinjiang is the most important cotton-producing region in China, and according to the National Bureau of Statistics, the area under cotton cultivation in Xinjiang will be 35 million mu in 2017, accounting for 61 percent of the country's cotton area.
Since the introduction of the earth film into China in 1982, more than 50 million mu have been covered by various crops in Xinjiang, and the annual use of the earth film is about 300,000 tons.
Among them, cotton floor film cover rate reached 100%, cotton field film cover account for about 60% of the use of Xinjiang ground film.
The production of non-film cotton can be measured, and the yield of cotton can be achieved from 320 kg to 350 kg per mu.
Along with the increasing amount of soil membrane input in Xinjiang, the recovery rate of residual film is low, the amount of residual membrane in the soil is increasing gradually, and the soil structure damage caused by the residual membrane is a series of problems, which seriously affect the sustainable development of agriculture.
The residual membranes not only cause serious pollution to the soil, but also have a great influence on the quality of cotton fiber.
At present, more than one third of the cotton fields in Xinjiang have been mechanized for harvesting.
In 2017, Xinjiang will harvest about 14 million mu of cotton.
In the process of cotton harvesting, it is difficult to clear the shredded membranes that are doped in the raw cotton, and the quality of textile products can not be completely removed in the process of the subsequent textile processing.
On September 28, the national non-film cotton field observation and discussion exchange event was held in Shaya County, Xinjiang.
In order to solve the contamination of cotton fields, simplify the technology of cotton planting and improve the efficiency of cotton fields, Xun Xun led his team through eight years to carry out the "Chinese cotton 619" film-free cotton technology cultivation, so as to "add wings" to the development of agriculture and green in Xinjiang.
Through the innovation of breeding new ideas, we have developed a new line of "Chinese cotton 619", which is precocious, saline-resistant, low-temperature and abundant.
"Under the conditions of film-free cultivation in the southern region of Xinjiang, a series of complementary measures such as film-free sowing machinery, improved seeding depth, shallow burying of dripping tubes under film-free conditions, suitable seeding density screening, reasonable chemical control and so on have been realized."
At present, demonstration bases for film-free cotton have been set up in Aksu, Kurl and Arar, with a yield of 4,800 kg per hectare.
Cotton growing without film has achieved abundant production, cost-saving and environmental protection, and the overall benefits have been improved.
Zhang Dunhai, an agronomist at the third division of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, said that with the research and demonstration of film-free cotton cultivation technology over the past six years, the yield of film-free cotton seeds could yield between 320 kg and 350 kg per hectare, possibly even higher.
"There is a great prospect for the promotion of membrane-free cotton cultivation technology."
Zhang Dunhai believes that, at present, film-free cotton cultivation technology can completely solve the problem of soil residual membrane pollution, but there is still some gap between the economic benefits and the cultivation of soil membrane.
"The support of the cotton purchase price will be beneficial to the future promotion."
Next, he and his team will continue to carry out in-depth research and widespread application of film-free cotton, making the industry strong enough to solve the problem of soil pollution caused by the film, he said.
Guangdong Sea, Land and Air Actively Respond to National Day Gold Week Transport - Zhongxin Network
On 29 September, the seventh day of the official opening of the Hong Kong section of the high-speed railway, and the first weekend since its opening, the West Kowloon station was filled with people.
In the coming days, journalists have learned from relevant departments that Guangdong railway, aviation, water transportation, highways and other transportation departments have been actively planning to increase their capacity and put in place various safeguard measures to ensure the safety and orderly transportation of passengers within the territory during the Golden Week.
During the National Day Golden Week this year, Guangzhou Iron Group expects to carry 17.8 million passengers, an increase of 150.5 million, or 9.2 percent, over the same period, according to China Railway Guangzhou Bureau Group Co., Ltd.
To meet the travel needs of passengers, Guangzhou Railway Group plans to open 104 more high-speed trains and 85 more full-speed trains, mainly on popular routes such as Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Hangzhou and Shenzhen.
Guangzhou Baiyun Airport will be the busiest airport in the Mainland during the Golden Week of the National Day this year. It is expected to take in more than 1.4 million passengers and take in more than 9,200 flights.
With an increasing number of international routes, the airport is expected to see a significant increase in international passengers compared with the past, which will be a notable feature of this year's Golden Week holiday.
It is understood that Singapore, Bangkok, Phuket, Jakarta, Colombo, Maldives and Manila are among the most popular destinations for this year's National Day holiday, as well as Kathmandu, Kuala Lumpur and Bali, where "one vote is hard to find" for some flights.
In particular, some airlines have increased their operating schedules, such as: One new Guangzhou-Hanoi flight per day for Shenzhen Airlines; one new Guangzhou-Tehran flight per Saturday for Iran-Mahan Airlines; and one new Guangzhou-Hanoi flight per week for Vietnam-Vietnam Airlines, two or four days a week.
In order to ensure the holiday, Baiyun Airport has increased the security of key posts, such as "baggage distribution" and "passenger security", and made preparations for large-scale delay in the handling of flights.
China Southern Airlines said its routes to ANZ, North America and Japan and South Korea were extremely hot this year, while flights to mainland Chinese destinations such as Hainan, Chengdu, Luzhou, Kyushu, Anshan and Huangshan were also relatively tight.
Southern Airlines plans to add 50 flights during Golden Week, including 10 on the Guangzhou-to-Chiang Mai route.
The Guangdong Maritime Bureau said that before the festival, it had carried out serious safety checks on key vessels such as water tourism vessels, Qiongzhou Channel passenger ferries, Pearl River Estuary high-speed passenger boats and ferry ferries to ensure a stable water traffic security situation during the long holiday period.
During the Golden Week, traffic in Guangdong Province is expected to be firmly at the top of China's list.
The Guangdong Transport Group recently issued guidelines for motorway travel during the holiday season, predicting an increase of about 12 per cent in motorway traffic.
The General Administration of Market Supervision recently issued the Notice on Strengthening the Regulation of Market Prices during the National Day of Mid-Autumn 2018, which calls for the strengthening of price supervision in the areas of housing leasing and real estate, and for the strict control of illegal acts such as colluding in rent prices, hoarding of rental premises, fabricating false information to raise rents, mischarging by means of bundling services, publishing misleading price information and unmarked prices.
The notice makes it clear that it is necessary to strengthen the early warning of price monitoring and pay close attention to the market price dynamics.
All localities should pay close attention to the basic necessities, such as the salt of meat and poultry eggs, which are consumed in large quantities of grain and oil, as well as to the changes in the market and prices of the special items consumed by local residents during the holidays, and strengthen price monitoring and analysis and early warning.
Once we find out the tendency of market fluctuation and the problem of seedling, we should take timely measures to solve the problem effectively.
It is necessary to strengthen the supervision and inspection of the wholesale and retail links of the necessities of life, and to increase the frequency and supervision of places closely related to the daily consumption of the masses, such as commercial super-markets and farmers' markets, so as to urge operators to abide by the law and conduct business in good faith.
The notice states that it is necessary to strengthen the inspection of key areas to create a favorable holiday consumption environment; strengthen the supervision of ticket prices in the state-owned scenic areas; focus on the investigation and investigation of the failure of the state-owned scenic areas to implement the price level or floating range prescribed by the government; increase fees without authorization; raise ticket prices in the form of non-compliant "garden" tickets; increase prices by a large discount; bundle sales; do not carry out the prescribed price; do not carry out the preferential measures; and impose the illegal fees.
The notice requires that the regulation of the prices of the necessities of life, especially agricultural products, be strengthened.
Due to seasonal changes, natural disasters and outbreaks, the prices of essential agricultural products, such as vegetables and pork, have fluctuated recently in some areas.
All localities should, in the light of the actual local conditions, earnestly strengthen the regulation of agricultural and by-product market prices, cooperate with relevant departments in their efforts to stabilize production and market supply, and organize forces to carry out market-focused inspections and random spot checks.
More frequent inspections have been carried out on such commodities as pork, which are subject to tight supply and higher prices, and illegal acts such as hoarding, inflating prices and colluding to increase prices have been seriously investigated.
The notice noted the need to strengthen price regulation in the areas of housing rental and real estate.
During the Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day, which coincide with the peak season of housing rental and commodity housing sales, all localities should pay close attention to the price behavior of real estate enterprises, intermediary companies and related enterprises in connection with housing leasing, strictly regulate the colluding of rent prices, hoard rental sources, fabricate false information to raise rents, collect fees by means of bundling services, issue misleading price information, and unmarked prices, and conduct more checks on the establishment of a set of transparent market-price-price-fixing and other illegal measures to disrupt the market-price-making of the public-price-price-fixing of the market-making of the market-making and-making of the market-making of the-making of-making of-making of-price-price-price-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-selling-making-making-selling-selling-making-making-making-making-making-making-making-making-making-making-making-making-making-making-making-making-making-making-making-making-making-making-making-making-making-making-making-making-making-making-selling-making-making-making-making-making-making-making-making-making
The notice mentioned that all places should effectively regulate the price of other links in the tourism industry, focus on regulating the price order of such links as catering, accommodation, shopping, sightseeing, entertainment and parking, guide operators to do a good job of making clear price and fee announcements, and seriously investigate and punish all kinds of illegal pricing practices.
The notice says it is necessary to strengthen the inspection of transportation prices such as roads, railways, civil aviation and water transportation, and seriously investigate and punish such illegal acts as illegal price increases, out-of-price charges, and failure to mark prices in accordance with the regulations.
Implementation of the "Green Passage" for the transport of fresh agricultural products and the policy of exemption of small passenger bus tolls for major holidays.
It is necessary to innovate the means of supervision and working methods, strengthen the publicity of price laws and regulations for commodity retail enterprises and e-commerce platforms below the line, urge operators to improve price promotion schemes, and investigate and deal with illegal acts such as fictitious original prices, misleading price labelling and failure to fulfill price commitments in accordance with the law.
The number of passengers travelling to and from Shanghai and Hong Kong has exceeded 1.7 million since the first day of the 15-year anniversary of the Shanghai-Hong Kong train, which has experienced three speed increases.
At the same time, passengers from Hong Kong and Macao will not pass the examination for more than 15 seconds.
On October 1, 2003, the State Council approved the establishment of a temporary port for direct trains from Shanghai to Kowloon, and the Shanghai Railway Port, as the first direct-to-Hong Kong long-distance railway passenger port in China, marked the opening pattern of the port where Shanghai already has a "three-wing flight" of water, aviation and land.
So far, the Shanghai-Hong Kong train has been running straight through the city for 15 years.
The Shanghai Railway Border Check, which is tasked with checking the entry and exit border of Shanghai and Hong Kong, revealed on Monday that since its opening, Shanghai and Hong Kong trains have increased their speed three times, reducing the one-way journey time from nearly 30 hours to 19 hours, and that annual passenger traffic from less than 80,000 to more than 150,000 passengers has increased from the original number of arrivals to and from Shanghai, and that the total number of passengers travelling to and from Shanghai has exceeded 1.7 million in 15 years.
It has been reported that over the past 15 years, the Shanghai Railway border crossing points have signed a police co-ordination mechanism with the stations along the Shanghai-Kowloon trains, and police officers have been assigned to carry out on-board supervision to achieve full coverage of the 1991 km service and control.
Over the past 15 years, the Shanghai Railway Border Inspection Station has detected nearly 1,000 cases of various types of illegal and illegal acts, and has successfully solved cases of aliens smuggling in China with false certificates and using other people's documents as impersonators to leave the country.
The station has also established working exchanges and other mechanisms with the Joint Inspection Unit, conducted regular comprehensive counter-terrorism exercises at railway ports, joined forces with the defence, and constructed a "three-level moat" protective zone at the Ring Railway Port.
It is understood that over the past 15 years, the Shanghai railway border inspection department has continuously innovated services, and the speed of customs clearance has been greatly improved.
The station has also set up a "Jinglan" volunteer service group to provide loving help to the elderly, pregnant women and travelers with babies in their arms.
The Ministry of Finance, the State Administration of Taxation, the State Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Commerce have jointly issued a notice to further encourage overseas investors to invest in China, and the profits allocated by overseas investors from resident enterprises in China should be used for domestic direct investment without pre-tax policies, and the scope of application should be extended to all non-prohibited foreign investment projects and areas.
This policy will be implemented from 1 January 2018.
The notice made it clear that direct investment by foreign investors with a share of the profits, including capital increase, new construction and equity acquisition by overseas investors with a share of the profits, does not include the addition, transfer or acquisition of shares of listed companies other than the eligible strategic investments.
If an overseas investor may, in accordance with the relevant provisions, enjoy the policy of provisional withholding of pre-paid income tax but does not actually enjoy it, he may, within three years from the date of the actual payment of the relevant tax, apply for supplementary enjoyment of the policy and refund of the tax paid.
Moreover, foreign investors who enjoy the prescribed temporary withholding of income tax policy treatment may continue to enjoy the temporary withholding of income tax policy treatment if the reorganization of the invested enterprise meets the conditions for special reorganization and the tax treatment is carried out in accordance with the specific reorganization.
In order to ensure that profits derived from foreign investors are actually used for direct investment, the notification provides that where profits used for direct investment by foreign investors are paid in cash, the relevant funds shall be transferred directly from the account of the profit-sharing enterprise to the account of the invested enterprise or the equity transferor, prior to the direct investment, to other accounts within and outside the country; profits used by foreign investors for direct investment shall not be paid in the form of physical, marketable securities, or other non-cash forms of direct equity held by the enterprise, and the relevant assets shall not be transferred by the relevant assets directly from the enterprise before the investment.
The circular also requires the tax authorities to strengthen follow-up administration in accordance with the law.
Foreign investors who have enjoyed the policy of withholding pre-tax income tax for the time being and who fail to meet the requirements as verified by the tax authorities after follow-up administration shall be deemed to have failed to report and pay the enterprise income tax in accordance with the provisions, and shall be held liable for the delay in tax payment in accordance with the law, which shall be calculated from the date of payment of the relevant profits.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said Friday it will no longer allow imports of raw materials made by China's Huahai drug industry and preparations made using the company's raw materials.
A drug previously produced by the Huahai drug industry has been recalled because it contains a possible carcinogen.
The European Medicines Agency said it was considering further action on other ingredients produced by the drug.
The FDA said it found major production process problems during an FDA inspection at a pharmaceutical plant in China's maritime medicine industry, and then stopped importing them.
The FDA also says imports will be banned until the Chinese drug industry finds out how the impurities are produced and improves its quality control system.
In a statement posted on the company's website on September 29, the company said: "It is very surprised and regretful that the company is making positive and forceful changes to the problems in this official inspection of the United States and Europe, and that it is doing so in a positive manner.
In the current complex market environment, the company expressed concern.
At present, the company is organizing teams, including professional lawyers, to communicate and lodge complaints with United States and European Union officials in accordance with the relevant procedures in order to resume production as soon as possible, "he said.

Ex-Foreign Aid Accused of Playing False Ball North Controls Response to "Must Have It" - CNN.com
Yesterday afternoon, the Beijing-controlled football club (hereinafter referred to as North) issued an official response to the news that Anichebe, a former foreign aid to the team, had accused the team of playing fake football. The North side issued a statement stating that there was absolutely no case of playing fake football on the part of the club, which was entirely an attempt by Anichebe himself in the arbitration process to cover up his blatant breach of the contract agreement and to fabricate lies for his personal improper economic purposes.
At the same time, the North Control indicated that it would reserve the right to take all means to hold the parties concerned accountable.
According to the Daily Mail, Nigerian player Agnieszbey has charged FIFA with allegedly playing fake ball last year against Beijing North, which includes the Beijing Derby in the 21st round of the 2017 season.
It was a crucial stage for the Beijing men and the Panthers, who were 0-2 away from home in that game, and Anichebi started the game.
There was an official response to the Nigerian player's claims yesterday from the north-controlled club.
The statement said that, following an internal investigation prior to the club, there had been no cases of playing fake ball in matches in which the team had participated.
Anichebe joined Beijing North in June 2017, and in December of the same year, he refused to return to the team for winter training without justifiable reasons, despite repeated calls from the club to do so.
At present, the dispute between the two parties has been submitted to FIFA and arbitration is under way.
The statement also mentioned that the high-profile "false-ball allegation" was in fact a lie fabricated by Anichebe in the course of arbitration to cover up his flagrant breach of the contract agreement for his personal and improper economic purposes.
Its sole purpose of slandering the club and slandering Chinese football is to gain undue economic benefits.
The club does not accept any organization or any individual to engage in baseless accusations, slander, slander or slander against the club for the benefit of its financial interests and for the sake of private grievances.
As a result, the Northern side indicated that it would reserve the right to take all means to hold the parties concerned accountable.

Chinese journalist taken away by police at British Conservative Party annual conference, China demands apology
A spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Britain responded to a question about a Chinese journalist who was taken away by police during the Conservative Party's annual conference in Britain on Monday, according to the website of the Chinese Embassy in the UK.
'we ask the Tory Human Rights Commission to stop interfering in China's internal affairs, stop meddling in Hong Kong's affairs, and ask the conference organisers to apologise to the Chinese journalists, 'the spokesman said.
On 30 September, during the annual meeting of the Conservative Party of the United Kingdom, the party's Human Rights Committee held a side event on Hong Kong, inviting Hong Kong's opposition to speak.
During the side meeting, a Chinese journalist was taken away by the police.
What comments do you have, please?
In response, the spokesman said that in the 21 years since the return of Hong Kong to the motherland, the practice of "one country, two systems" has been a great success, and Hong Kong's development achievements have been universally recognized.
Hong Kong is China's Hong Kong, and Hong Kong's affairs are purely China's internal affairs.
The Conservative Human Rights Commission used the party's annual conference to hold a side event for anti-China separatists, and China expressed serious concern and strong dissatisfaction.
We firmly oppose any interference by any organization in Hong Kong's affairs in any way.
Any attempt or act to promote "Hong Kong independence" is futile.
The spokesman said it was totally unacceptable for the UK to consistently claim freedom of expression, but when Chinese journalists asked questions at a side meeting to express their views, they were thwarted and even physically violated.
We ask the Conservative Human Rights Commission to stop interfering in China's internal affairs, stop meddling in Hong Kong's affairs, and ask the conference organisers to apologise to Chinese journalists.

Achievements in the development of Internet science and technology for the benefit of all peoples
The innovative development driven by Internet technology is ultimately the creation of a better future for the peoples of the world and a more equal, open and inclusive environment for the well-being of mankind, economic development and the well-being of society.
In a large country such as China, which has a large user base, Internet technology has a strong amplification effect on specific applications.
For example, Beidou provides users with high-precision, high-reliability positioning, speed measurement and timing services, as well as unique short-message communication capabilities; the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has reshaped the traditional industry, promoted industry progress, and played an active role in many areas such as finance, transportation, health and safety; and the world-wide communication technology has been instrumental in solving the problem of Internet access for users, such as airplanes and high-iron transportation vehicles.
China, the world's largest Internet market, is making progress in social development through the digital process, according to the forty-second Statistical Report on the Development of China's Internet Network, released by the China Internet Information Center.
And the dividends of Internet technology development are by no means limited to China, and its results are also a powerful driving force for the development of the Internet in the whole world, as well as economic and social development.
For example, China's cross-border electricity merchants and sharing economy are moving overseas, supporting the growth of the world economy. China's new generation of information technologies, such as cloud computing, big data, Internet of things and mobile Internet, is accelerating the deepening of the global division of labour and economic restructuring, and reshaping the global economic competitive landscape.
As outlined in the Wuzhen Initiative, launched at the Second World Internet Congress, sharing the results of network development, facilitating the early formation of connected global online markets and creating more jobs, will provide a strong support for the sustainable and healthy development of the global economy and allow more countries and people to take the fast-track ride of the information age.

Speaking to the US Council on Foreign Relations on Friday, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China-US relations are once again at a crossroads and could open up better prospects if the two sides can actively embrace each other, expand and deepen positive cooperation and properly manage their differences.
"China-US relations are our common asset and we need to take care of it together," he said.
He expressed hope that people from all walks of life in the two countries will take concrete action to safeguard the healthy and stable development of China-US relations and work together to push the China-US relationship forward in the right direction.
Wang also stressed once again that China will certainly walk out of a development path that is different from that of the traditional big powers.
This path with Chinese characteristics dictates that China will not, and cannot, repeat the mistakes of the country ’ s power, and that China will neither become the United States, nor challenge the United States, nor replace it.
In a speech titled "Opportunity or Challenge, Partner or Counterparty," Wang said the deeper sticking point is that some American friends believe that China, too, will challenge and replace America ’ s leadership in the world.
"This is clearly a significant strategic miscarriage of justice," the statement read.
But this self-imagined suspicion is spreading, he says, amplifying existing contradictions, creating new doubts, and making it more difficult and resistant to solving specific problems between China and the United States.
Wang Yi pointed out that China is following a path of peaceful development.
The Chinese have never had a gene for external expansion.
We believe that all countries can live together in harmony and share experiences with each other.
Whether in the past, now or in the future, China will not copy foreign models, nor will it ask other countries to copy China's practices.
Earlier, during a meeting with former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in New York, Wang said that China-US cooperation would be a win-win, and that confrontation would inevitably be a win-lose.
China has always been committed to the development of long-term healthy and stable China-US relations, so as to achieve non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation.
The State Office of the People's Republic of China held a press conference on Tuesday to introduce and interpret the White Paper on "Facts and China's Position on Sino-US Economic and Trade Conflicts".
China is willing to work hard to push bilateral trade in a more balanced direction, and hopes the US side will also show a positive attitude, said Fu, China's vice-minister of commerce, at the launch.
On September 28, the Indonesian island of Sulawesi was hit by a powerful tsunami that severely damaged several cities along the coast, with the latest news showing that the number of people killed had risen to 1,200, according to a report by foreign media.
The town of Donggala, near the epicenter of the quake, was reportedly hit by two waves, and authorities believe the toll will continue to rise as the "golden 72 hours" of relief pass.
Rescuers carry an earthquake survivor who was pulled from under the rubble of a restaurant in Palu, Central Sulawesi province, Indonesia, on September 30, 2018, local time.
Officials from the disaster relief department said the tsunami brought waves as high as six meters, and the magnitude of the earthquake and tsunami's impact exceeded people's original estimates.
Hundreds of people were celebrating on the beach in Palu when the earthquake and tsunami struck, killing many as they were swept away by huge waves, it is understood.
Officials say many buildings and infrastructure were destroyed when the tsunami hit the shore at a speed of 800 kilometers per hour.
Thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed, and tsunami-triggered mudslides cut off a major highway in Palu, he said.
A bridge that straddles a coastal river collapsed in Sulawesi.
Indonesian President Joko Duterte inspects the earthquake-hit city of Central Sulawesi Palu on September 30, local time.
Indonesian President Joko Zorko, who visited the disaster area on September 30, said troops had been sent to help with the search and rescue efforts, calling on the victims to be patient.
Zorko noted that rescue operations were difficult because of the shortage of heavy machinery and human resources.
He was informed of the lack of water, food and fuel in many of the affected areas, as well as the fact that many businesses had closed down after the earthquake and had sent airplanes to drop supplies.
He appealed to the victims to be patient and to stay in their place until they could be rescued.
Search and rescue workers in the city of Palu said they heard cries for help from a collapsed hotel in the city, but some people needed to be rescued with bare hands because no heavy machinery was available to remove the rubble.
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami could eventually rise to thousands after power and communications were cut off in some areas, Indonesian Vice President Kala said.
Beijing, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Correspondent Xu Zhiqiang learned from the Liaoning Provincial Court today that during a six-month battle against the "storm", the Liaoning Provincial Court severely cracked down on the refusal of execution, transferring 241 people to refuse to carry out the crime and maintaining the high-pressure situation in the fight against the violation of the law.
It is understood that according to the unified deployment of the Liaoning High Court, from early April to the end of September, the Liaoning Court launched a six-month campaign to basically resolve the difficult "storm", assemble the dominant forces and launch an all-round general attack on the basic solution.
At the same time, the provincial courts have organized, in accordance with the law, "five" activities involving fines, detention of a number, restriction of consumption of a quantity, punishment for dishonesty, and transfer of a number of persons who refuse to commit crimes.
At the beginning of the event, there were more than 132,000 outstanding enforcement cases in the provincial courts, and at the end of July, the cases were closed to the bottom.
During the campaign, the provincial courts fined the person subjected to execution a total of $1,206.07 million, detained 4,146 persons, restricted consumption of 162,844 persons, discredited and disciplined 55,128 persons, and transferred 241 persons who refused to serve their sentences.
From January to October this year, Liaoning courts handled 297,438 enforcement cases, an increase of 13.28 percent year-on-year; 226,558 cases, an increase of 83.18 percent year-on-year; and 312.36 billion yuan, a rise of 74.94 percent year-on-year.
"Where can I take a taxi, please?
We want to go to Golden Bauhinia Square to see the National Day flag-raising ceremony!
Mr. and Mrs. Song, who flew from Ningxia to Shenzhen and took the first bus on the National Day of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen High-Speed Railway in Shenzhen, were asked by reporters at the West Kowloon Station, Hong Kong, on the morning of October 1, to visit the Chinese news agency.
On the morning of 1 October, in celebration of the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region held a ceremonial flag-raising ceremony in the Golden Bauhinia Square.
As at 30 September, the number of passengers entering Hong Kong via the high-speed rail station at West Kowloon had exceeded 300,000, according to immigration control station statistics.
On the occasion of the 69th anniversary of the motherland, the West Kowloon Border Inspection Station is expected to see a peak of visitors to Hong Kong on 1 and 2 October.
At 7: 00 a.m. on Sunday, a large number of Mainland visitors took advantage of the National Day Golden Week to take part in a high-speed rail trip to Hong Kong.
The brisk Mrs Song told reporters that the National Day holiday was a rare holiday of the year and that it had been her wish to come to Hong Kong's Golden Bauhinia Square to see the flag raised. She felt particularly happy and excited to be able to achieve it on the National Day.
However, at present, flights to and from Hong Kong in Ningxia are not convenient, so as to be able to pass through the Hong Kong section of the high-speed railway, Mr. Song found that the first bus could arrive at 7.03 a.m. to connect the city's transport to the Golden Bauhinia Plaza. The time was just good.
He lamented to reporters: "High-speed rail is really too convenient, fast and time-bound!"
The daily 70-hour short-haul trains to and from Guangzhou South, Shenzhen North and Fukuda and West Kowloon have brought residents from the Tai Wan area of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao to Hong Kong in a very large number of places.
Mr. Liu, who lives in Shenzhen, is on his way to join his Hong Kong friends on the hill at the top of the Central Peak.
Mr Lau said: "The Mainland and Hong Kong are on holiday on National Day and we are going to challenge ourselves to see if we can finish the 50-kilometre Hong Kong Island Trail!"
He explained that if the high-speed rail were not open, convenient and time-consuming, they would not be able to easily attempt such long-distance mountain-walking activities.
Mrs. Yang, from Dongguan, who took her 10-year-old son on a high-speed rail ride to Hong Kong for a piano competition, proudly told reporters that his son had been studying the piano for three years, and that it made sense to spend the National Day in this way.
She had been on the bus before, but it was time consuming, and she was worried about the impact on her son's condition. This time she came through Shenzhen on a high-speed railway. She was more impressed by the ease of customs clearance and half the time she spent, and she told reporters: "It's like taking the subway, especially fast, I didn't even have time to take pictures!"
On September 23, at 6: 44 a.m., the G5711 "Harmony" high-speed rail train set off from Shenzhen North Station and sped along. A few minutes later, the train entered the Hong Kong section of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen High-speed Railway, the first officially operated high-speed rail train in Hong Kong.
Integrated into the country's 25,000-kilometer high-speed rail network and the Hong Kong section of the high-speed rail to 38 long-distance stations across the country, it also welcomed Mainland visitors from different provinces in the north and south of the country.
Mr Gao, who was visiting Hong Kong from Changsha on a small long holiday, told reporters that he felt very happy when he was able to take the high-speed rail to the north of Shenzhen, pass the subway through Hong Kong and travel through the city, and take a difficult and time-consuming trip to the centre of Kowloon, where he could eat lunch with his children.
He said the "two-check" clearance process was far more convenient than thought, with "less than 10 minutes to go, and both of them were over."
The West Kowloon station, which is adjacent to the Airport Express and connects land and air traffic, has also become the preferred destination for a large number of transit passengers.
Miss Wu, from Fujian province, prepared to travel to the Philippines from Hong Kong for the Golden Week, pushed her luggage in West Kowloon, and said to reporters, "I was afraid I could not catch the plane. I didn't think it would be so fast."
The new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal will retain U.S. President Donald Trump's ability to implement the threat of a 25 percent tariff on imported cars, while essentially exempting passenger cars, pickups and auto parts imported from Canada and Mexico from paying tariffs, according to the trade deal's subsidiary arrangement announced Monday.
If Trump imposes so-called "Chapter 232" tariffs on cars for national security reasons, both Mexico and Canada would have quotas for passenger cars that export 2.6 million vehicles a year to the United States that are exempt from taxes.
Under the subsidiary arrangement, pickup cards produced in both countries will be fully exempt from customs duties.
If Trump imposes tariffs on cars, Mexico would get an exemption of $108 billion a year for auto parts, and Canada would get a quota of $32.4 billion.
Both quotas are well above the current production levels of both countries, providing room for growth in both countries' exports.
Washington, September 28 (Xinhua) -- After several days of wrangling, U.S. President Donald Trump's administration and Canada are making real efforts to resolve trade policy differences, raising hopes that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) will remain in the form of a tripartite agreement, according to a Reuters / Mexico report Friday.
This apparent progress, though lacking in detail, is enough to prompt the Governments of Mexico and the United States to abruptly halt their plans to publish the texts of the two trade agreements and to give Canada more time to accede to them.
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, Mexico's president-elect, told reporters in Mexico that the U.S. government had made new counter-proposals to the Canadian government and said he would continue to press for the participation of all three countries in NAFTA.
Ildefonso Guajardo, Mexico's economy minister, said the submission of the text of the US-Mexico trade agreement to Mexican and US legislation had been delayed because the Canadian and US governments were "very serious" about trying to reach an agreement.
"In the next 48 hours, we will know whether we will reach a text of a tripartite agreement or whether we will have to publish the text of the agreement between the two parties," Guajardo said.
Guajardo said his U.S. and Canadian counterparts "specifically asked" for a delay in the release of the text.
A spokesman for the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) did not comment on the text of the US-Mexico trade agreement or on the United States-Canada consultations.
Officials from the Office of the Prime Minister of Canada and the Office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs did not respond to requests for comment on the counter-proposal.
In a conservation center on the outskirts of Pretoria, South Africa's capital, two young lions play with each other, making it hard to see any abnormalities, but they are not alone, according to foreign media reports.
"This is the first baby lion ever to be born with artificial insemination -- the first pair in the world," the University of Pretoria announced.
In-school scientists are working to study the reproductive system of the female African lion.
Ganswert, director of the Mammal Research Institute at the University of Pretoria, said the two cubs, who were born on August 25, were a male and a female, fairly healthy and normal.
After 18 months of intensive testing, his team finally made the breakthrough.
"We collected sperm from a healthy male lion," Ganswert said in a media interview.
Next, the researchers performed artificial insemination on the lioness when the hormone levels in it reached the appropriate level.
"Fortunately, the results were successful," Mr Ganswetter said.
He said the researchers "made several attempts, but unexpectedly it didn't take a lot of effort."
He said the previous research breakthrough could be repeated, and scientists hope to use the technology to save the endangered big cats.
According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), lions have been extinct in 26 countries in Africa, and the total number of surviving wild lions has plummeted by 43 per cent in the past 20 years, with only about 20,000 left.
The African lion is classified as a vulnerable animal by this organization.
"If we don't do something about this animal, they're going to be extinct," Ganswindt said.
He said the new technology did not have to allow lions to be reared, but simply injected sperm into impregnable lionesses, just as North America and Europe have done with captive elephants.
South Korea's exports fell by the largest amount in more than two years in September, but analysts blamed the decline on fewer days of work and said global demand for South Korean goods remained strong despite rising trade tensions between China and the United States.
Indeed, South Korea's exports increased on a daily basis last month.
In addition, initial figures released earlier showed a double-digit increase in exports in the first weeks of September before the long holiday.
South Korea's exports fell in September, the biggest year-on-year decline since July 2016, more than the 5.7 per cent decline predicted by 11 analysts polled by Reuters.
Initial figures released on Monday showed exports of $50.6 billion in September, down from $51.2 billion in August.
South Korea's exports to China rose 7.8 percent in September, the 23rd consecutive month of expansion, despite worries that a growing U.S.-China trade dispute could cause other export-dependent Chinese neighbors to suffer as well.
South Korea's exports to the United States fell 11.8 percent, as sales of oil products slid.
Overseas sales of Korean memory chips and petroleum products rose 28.3 per cent and 13.5 per cent, respectively, despite concerns that the so-called "supercycle" of chips may have peaked.
"However, the impact of the trade conflict will be difficult to avoid, as South Korea's exports depend to a considerable extent on the US and Chinese markets," he said.
Imports slid 2.1 per cent to $40.8 billion, not as much as the 3.1 per cent growth forecast in the Reuters survey.
The trade surplus in September was initially $9.7 billion, up from $6.9 billion in August.
The ministry said global manufacturing would remain buoyant, thanks to the United States and European Union countries, which is a positive factor for South Korean exports.
"Higher export prices, caused by higher oil prices, will also benefit exports in the second half of the year," the statement noted.
"But the continuation of the trade conflict between the United States and China, coupled with increased market volatility following the US rate hike, is a negative pressure on exports," he said.
Exports rose to an average of $2.6 billion per workday in September, compared with $2.1 billion in August.
South Korea's Mid-Autumn Festival falls on September 24-26, so there were only 19.5 working days in September, four days less than the same month last year.
South Korea's January-September exports grew 4.7 percent from the same month a year earlier.
South Korean manufacturing activity picked up in September, according to the Nikkei / Markit Purchasing Managers' Index, but was buoyed by domestic orders, which fell from China and Japan, lest the prospect of another export be clouded.
North Korean media criticise US for not easing sanctions on North Korea
North Korea's Labor News published an op-ed on September 30, criticizing the United States for seeking dialogue with the DPRK while not easing sanctions against the DPRK, calling it a "contradictory" practice.
The article said US Secretary of State Pompeo said on Thursday that "in order to achieve the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, the key is to implement the sanctions against the DPRK", stressing that the United States' position on continuing to implement the UN sanctions resolution remains unchanged.
In the joint statement of the DPRK and the US in Singapore, the two sides pledged to establish a new DPRK-US relationship commensurate with the aspirations of the two peoples for peace and prosperity.
It would be paradoxical for the United States to call for dialogue while increasing the pressure on sanctions.
If a new Korean-American relationship is to be established, a permanently consolidated peace regime built on the Korean peninsula and complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is to be achieved, the paper says, building trust should be put at the forefront, starting with what can be done and resolving it in stages, one by one.
The article also said the United States should understand that sanctions would not work for North Korea.
The article said that even the "North Devonsk" before the "Kazan" gave the U.S. troops a sigh of admiration.
"We are going to meet strong potential adversaries," National Interest magazine quoted the US Navy as saying. "It's enough to just look at the North Devonsk."
Forgo, the current commander-in-chief of the U.S. Navy in Europe, has also praised the North Devonsk submarine.
"This submarine is impressive," he said. "Looking at the development of the Russian navy and how it uses its resources, it will know that its main effort in research and development is first and foremost to strengthen the submarine fleet."
But National Interest magazine still believes the United States maintains an advantage over Russia in this area.
"I believe there is still an asymmetrical advantage in the West," Fogo said.
The announcement follows reports that the Russian navy will install the Kazan submarines in 2019.
The "Kazan", "Novosibirsk", "Krasnoyarsk" and "Alhangersk" multi-purpose submarines are all modified to be "white-wax trees-M", with a capacity of 13,800 tons, a depth of 520 metres, a strength of 64 personnel, an underwater speed of 31 knots, and will carry water mines, torpedoes and "caliber" and "onyx" cruise missiles.

Ignore the American threat!
EU may strike crude oil purchase deal with Iran
Washington (AP) - The U.S. government has said it will restart a new round of sanctions against Iran in November, even urging other countries to reduce imports of Iranian oil.
America's allies, though, don't seem to have listened.
29 (UPI) -- Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif revealed Wednesday that Tehran is close to reaching an agreement with the European Union on the sale of crude oil, despite a U.S. threat to sanction any country doing business with Iran, the New York Times reported.
The central purpose of the agreement is to try to create a new payment mechanism, in the form of barter or local currency, to replace dollar transactions.
The aim of the approach is to hope to bypass the United States and prevent the United States from blocking financial transfers.
At the same time, while the EU is working to broker the deal, some French and British officials have raised concerns that if the deal is achieved, it would be the most open confrontation between the EU and the United States, which opposes a US exit from the Iran nuclear deal.
In an hour-long interview, Zarif's words sounded more upbeat than they have been in recent months, the US media said.
Because the agreement has the ability to “peel off ” America ’ s traditional allies and effectively break the US ’ s attempts to cut Iran ’ s revenues.
"This will ensure that we sell oil and benefit," Zarif said, arguing that countries have a legitimate right to trade with Iran under the 2015 agreement.
The EU's foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, has also said that "no sovereign state or organization can accept anyone else to decide who it can do business with."
She also predicted, however, that before the US government launches its next sanctions in November, it is possible for US leaders to resort to a range of financial instruments aimed at banks, businessmen and countries with which Tehran has business dealings.
In May, the U.S. government unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal on the grounds that the agreement was flawed, saying it could not permanently ban Iran from producing nuclear fuel.
The US then threatened to ban companies that buy Iranian oil and other goods from doing business in the US.
The threat led to the withdrawal of some companies from Tehran and the collapse of the Iranian currency.
Companies such as Airbus and French oil giant Total have canceled billions of dollars of investment in Iraq.
British and French officials have said the US government may "gain the upper hand."
Otherwise, according to a recent report in Turkish media, the US sanctions do not appear to have had much impact on Iran ’ s oil exports.
No country other than South Korea has stopped buying Iranian oil, Iranian Oil Minister Mohammad Zangane has revealed.
Both Zarif and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani argue that a series of US actions are aimed at "seducing" Iran into violating the agreement.
Zarif was also dismissive of a barrage of verbal attacks by the US, and when asked whether the US would overturn the current Iranian government with increasing financial pressure, Zarif even laughed, "It is a strategy of regime change, and that is the real purpose of the US."
"Re-visit the Battery Memory Fanghua": Xiamen Huli Mountain Battery Cultural Tourism Market Opening Ceremony
Old Chen Feifei, the first radio announcer in Fujian's front-line broadcasting station, came to the Battery to recount the history of the Battery.
The famous tourist scenic spot, which is separated from Jinmen by water, was once the site of the "front-line broadcasting station" set up by the People's Liberation Army (PLA).
On the 30th day of the 60th anniversary of the opening of the Front Line Broadcasting Station, the scenic area held a "retour of the Battery to remember Fanghua" event, inviting several historical witnesses of the former Front Line Radio Station to talk freely about the historical changes of the Battery and witness the development of cross-strait relations.

In order to further encourage foreign investors to invest in China, the Ministry of Finance and other four ministries jointly notified that, as of January 1, 2018, profits allocated by foreign investors from resident enterprises in China will be used for domestic direct investment without the application of the pre-tax policy, and that the scope of application of foreign investment incentive projects will be extended to all projects and areas not prohibited from foreign investment.
According to the notice posted on the website of the Ministry of Finance, the temporary non-collection of pre-tax income tax by foreign investors is subject to several conditions at the same time, including direct investment by foreign investors with a share of profits, including capital increase, new construction, equity acquisition and other equity investment by foreign investors with a share of profits, except for the addition, conversion and acquisition of shares of listed companies (with the exception of eligible strategic investments).
It also includes profits earned by foreign investors that belong to the income from dividends, dividends and other equity investment resulting from the actual distribution of the realized retained earnings to investors by resident enterprises within the territory of China.
Where profits used by foreign investors for direct investment are paid in cash, the relevant funds shall be transferred directly from the account of the profit-sharing enterprise to the account of the invested enterprise or the equity transferor, and no other account shall flow within or outside the country before the direct investment; where profits used by foreign investors for direct investment are paid in the form of non-cash, such as in kind, marketable securities, the ownership of the relevant assets shall be transferred directly from the profit-distributing enterprise to the investment enterprise or to the transfer of the equity holding by the enterprise or the person to hold on behalf of the other person before the direct investment.
The notice states that the foreign investor actually recovers the direct investment that enjoys the treatment of withholding the prepayment of income tax by means of equity transfer, buyback, liquidation, etc., and shall, within 7 days after the actual collection of the corresponding amount, report to the tax department in accordance with the prescribed procedures for the payment of the deferred tax.
To encourage foreign investors to continue to invest in China, four ministries, including the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Commerce, jointly issued a notice at the end of 2017 that, with effect from January 1, 2017, foreign investors should invest directly in incentive investment projects from resident enterprises in China, and that, if they meet the prescribed conditions, they should adopt a deferred tax policy and refrain from collecting income tax in advance.
Last week, China's executive meeting of the State Council decided to expand the scope of application of the temporary non-collection of pre-tax income tax on foreign investment from encouraging foreign capital projects to all non-prohibited projects and areas, and to further strengthen intellectual property protection.
The reporter learned from the National Health Board that, compared with a few decades ago, the incidence of malnutrition among children and adolescents in our country has decreased, but the incidence of overweight and obesity has increased significantly.
In this regard, experts point out that maintaining a healthy weight, the most important concept is to "cure the disease", vigorously promote scientific fitness, reasonable diet.
The key to maintaining a healthy weight is rational diet and scientific exercise, according to the National Commission on Health and Health, the core information and interpretation of health education for young people in China (2018 edition), released recently.
Being overweight, obese and losing weight blindly is not good for health.
The health pitfalls behind "Little Fat Pier" cannot be ignored.
Ding Jianqiang, director of the National Institute of Nutrition and Health at the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said overweight endangers adolescents' normal growth and development, adversely affects their psychological, behavioral, cognitive and intellectual well-being, and can even lead to high blood pressure, high blood sugar and high blood fat in children.
At the same time, overweight obesity in adolescents tends to continue into adulthood, which will increase the risk of chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes in adolescents as adults.
Ding said tests of nutrition and health conditions for Chinese residents in 2010-2012 showed a 9.6 percent overweight rate among children aged 6-17 and a 6.4 percent obesity rate among teenagers in China, both adding up to 16 percent.
At the same time, overweight obesity among children and adolescents is higher among boys than among girls, and higher in urban than in rural areas, and the rate of overweight obesity has increased significantly in recent decades.
How do teens cope with overweight obesity?
Zhang Chin, deputy director of the Center for Scientific Fitness and Health Promotion and Research at the State Sports Administration, said the main causes of obesity among teenagers are excessive calorie intake and insufficient physical activity.
For this kind of homogenous obesity, attention should be paid to scientific exercise plus reasonable dietary control.
Zhang pointed out that the most important concept of maintaining a healthy weight is "cure the disease". One of the most important aspects is to provide all-round science education to schools, parents and students, popularize the dangers of overweight and obesity, and raise young people's awareness of prevention.
Adolescents should have regular medical examinations to monitor growth and development indicators such as high body weight, early detection, scientific judgment of the occurrence of overweight and obesity, so that timely intervention can be taken.
For teenagers who are already overweight and obese, Ting suggests that, in addition to actively and scientifically arranging meals and exercise, adolescents are at a special physiological stage, should avoid the use of hunger or semi-starvation therapy to control and lose weight, and should not blindly take weight-loss drugs.
Reuters, September 28 (UPI) -- Facebook (FB.O) said Friday that hackers stole digital login code, giving them access to nearly 50 million user accounts, in what it said was the worst security breach in its history.
Facebook, which has more than 2.2 billion monthly users, said it has not yet determined whether the attacker abused any accounts or stole personal information.
The company also has not found a location for the hackers, and is not sure if the hackers targeted specific victims.
Its initial analysis suggests that this was a large-scale attack.
In a media conference call with reporters, CEO Zuckerberg called the incident "really serious."
His account number, as well as that of Sheryl Sandberg, the director of operations, were also affected, a spokesman for the company said.
Facebook shares fell 2.6 percent on Friday, dragging down major Wall Street stock indexes.
Washington U.S. lawmakers said on Friday the attack could add to calls for data privacy legislation.
"This is yet another sad piece of evidence that Congress needs to act to protect the privacy and security of social media users," Democratic Sen. Mark Warner said in a statement.
'i hope to get answers about Reuters' coverage of the security breach, 'Federal Trade Commission (FTC) commissioner Rohit Chopra tweeted.

"Veterans of the War of Resistance are witnesses of the Chinese War of Resistance. They are authentic, vivid and vivid materials of patriotism."
Liu Xiao, the former vice president of the CPPCC in Hunan Province, said that the spirit of patriotism of the war veterans, brave and intrepid, is a valuable spiritual asset to the contemporary people.
In his speech, Zhu Jianjun, vice-chairman of the CPPCC of Changsha City and head of the committee of Changsha City, said that in recent years, the program has become an outstanding brand in the work of civil society services in Changsha City by providing care for war veterans in the form of living allowances, free old-age care and free burial.
He believes that only by engraving history in his heart can he carry on the spirit of the war of resistance.
At 11 a.m., amid the solemn and heavy sound of music, people who had come to attend the event stood up.
Members of the Tang people's ceremonial team, dressed in gowns and with flowers in their arms, marched at a neat pace to send away the partners of 10 anti-war veterans and four veterans in a neat queue.
There were floral tributes for the veterans of the war, and many children in the crowd, who joined their parents in paying tribute to the war heroes.

On October 1, the newly revised Regulations for the Traffic Movement of the Three Gorges-Ge Chau Dam Water Resources Hub (hereinafter referred to as the "Scheduling Rules") was officially implemented, and the three Gorges lift aircraft were formally and uniformly dispatched with the ship lock after two years of trial navigation.
The first day of implementation of the new regulations, the Three Gorges-Ge Chau Dam waters navigation order is good.
On September 30, at 21: 00, the Three Gorges Navigation Administration issued its first security screening plan and conducted security checks on 160 ships, with 124 vessels eligible for inspection.
On 1 October, at 1400 hours, the Department of Navigation arranged the first closure scheme after the implementation of the new regulations.
Following the implementation of the new regulations, the security screening plan was issued at 9: 00 and 21: 00 each day, and the dam crossing plan was issued at 14: 00 and 20: 00 each day, thus facilitating the flexibility of the ship to arrange the dam crossing plan.
The Scheduling Rules add the principle of "classification control" to the ship-over-the-dam scheduling. According to the ship-gate and the function location of the hoist, the priority of the ship-over-the-dam is clearly defined, and the short-haul passenger ship of the overpass is adjusted to the same priority level as that of the demonstration ship and the honest ship.
It is also the second anniversary of the test operation of the hoist, officially with the ship lock unified scheduling.
For the first time, the Kawang River and the Three Gorges Reservoir area are also in the priority category of large, long and wide demonstration ships and new energy-powered ships.
At the same time, the Regulations on Movement Control have adjusted the "navigable dispatch management waters" from the previous 180 km near-dam waters to 541.8 km from the Yunyang Yangtze River Bridge to the Shiqiao Yangtze River Bridge, and delineated the "core waters, near-dam waters, controlled waters, and dispatch waters".
This will help the ship to choose suitable waters to be closed, and reduce the backlog of ships to be closed in the dam area.
In accordance with the characteristics of the current ship crossing dam and waiting for the gate, the Regulations on Movement Control also put forward such good faith restriction measures as cancellation of ship declaration of violation and delay of 24 hours passing over dam.
After the storage of water in the Three Gorges, the navigation conditions in the reservoir area have been improved, and the rapid development of the Yangtze River shipping has been promoted.
According to the data, the annual cargo volume of the Three Gorges and Gezhouba locks increased from 34.3 million tons in 2004 to 138 million tons and 140 million tons, respectively, in 2017.
In the past two years, 5,767 ships, 162.2 million passengers and 171.28 million tons of cargo traffic have been transported through the Three Gorges Rising Ship.
Chen Winter Yuan, deputy director of the Three Gorges Navigational Administration, said the Regulations on Movement Control had a positive effect on promoting the good faith management of the sluice, maintaining the traffic order of the two-dam hub, unlocking the pressure on the ship in the dam area, and improving its navigation capability.

With the approval of Premier Li Keqiang, the State Council has issued a "Decision on Further Reduction of the Control Catalogue of Production License for Industrial Products and Simplification of the Approval Procedure".
The Decision proposes to further reduce the catalogue of production licenses for industrial products, eliminate the control of production licenses for 14 categories of industrial products, and delegate the authority for the administration of production licenses for four categories of industrial products to the quality and technical supervision departments of the people's governments at the provincial level.
As a result of this reform, the number of products subject to the licensing of industrial products will be reduced from last year's 38 to the current 24.
The Decision makes it clear that there is a simplified approval process for products in the catalogue.
The first is to change the pre-license-issuing product inspection organized by the license-issuing organ to a product inspection and conformity report issued by the qualified inspection and testing institution at the time of application.
Second, in addition to hazardous chemicals, the products licensed by the quality technical supervision department (market supervision and administration department) of the people's government at the provincial level shall be subject to back-up on-site examination. After the enterprise submits the application and the product inspection conformity report and makes a commitment to ensure the safety of the product quality, it may obtain a production license after formal examination and then accept the on-site examination within the prescribed time.
Third, if an enterprise produces different types of products in its business catalogue, it shall, in accordance with the principle of "one-to-one certificate", examine and issue a license when applying for a new license or applying for a renewal of the license.
The Decision requires all regions and departments concerned to make a solid contribution to the work of reducing inventories and simplifying the approval process.
We will intensify the work of publicity and on-site review of enterprises' commitments, strengthen credit supervision and restraint measures, fulfill the responsibilities of the main body of the enterprise's quality, and revoke production licenses for all those who make false promises and do not meet the requirements.
In the case of products that have been removed from the control of industrial production licenses, after-action supervision should be earnestly strengthened, and products involving public health and safety, environmental protection, etc., may be converted to mandatory certification, with a positive list and publicity to the public, uniform certification standards, reasonable reduction and certification of inspection items, and mandatory certification fees shall, in principle, be borne by the various levels of finance according to the system.
We will take supportive measures to encourage enterprises to conduct voluntary certification, promote brand-building and expand the market.
We should promote the improvement of the quality of industrial products with respect to the international advanced standards.
We should give full play to the role of third-party social organizations and ensure the safety of industrial product quality.
It is necessary to improve the standard system, give full play to the advantages of industry supervision, strengthen the responsibility of "who approves and who supervises", dynamically assess the safety risks of product quality, and reduce catalogues, decentralize approval authority or convert to certification management in due course.
In September, China's composite PMI ring ratio lifted the manufacturing PMI ring ratio to fall.
China's composite PMI output index was 54.1 percent in September, up from an average of 0.3 and 0.1 percentage points in the previous month and year, according to data released by China's National Bureau of Statistics on Wednesday, indicating that Chinese companies' production and business activity overall remained steady.
During the month, the manufacturing production index and the non-manufacturing business activity index, which make up the composite PMI output index, were 53.0 per cent and 54.9 per cent, respectively, a drop of 1 per cent.
Among them, China's manufacturing PMI stood at 50.8 per cent and the ring ratio retreated 0.5 percentage points.
Mr Zhao said the manufacturing PMI this month had five main features:
The first is that manufacturing fundamentals are generally stable.
In 14 of the 21 sectors surveyed, PMI was in the expansion range, with manufacturing PMI, such as pharmaceuticals, specialized equipment and electrical machinery equipment, all at a higher operating level than 53.5 per cent and growing at a faster rate.
Second, there has been a small fluctuation in supply and demand.
The production index and the new orders index were at 53.0 per cent and 52.0 per cent, respectively, down 0.3 and 0.2 percentage points from the previous month, while supply and demand continued to be buoyant, but expansion slowed slightly.
The new export orders index and the import index were at 48.0 per cent and 48.5 per cent, respectively, down from 1.4 and 0.6 percentage points the previous month, both of which fell to year lows.
Fourth, the cost of purchasing raw materials of enterprises has been increased.
The main raw material buying price index was at 59.8 per cent, up 1.1 percentage points from the previous month, and the factory price index was at 54.3 per cent, the same as the previous month, both at year-high levels.
Fifth, the operation of large enterprises is sound, and the operation status of small enterprises continues to improve.
The large-scale PMI was 52.1 per cent, unchanged from the previous month, and has been in the expansion range of 52.0 per cent and above this year, with both the production index and the new orders index rounding up this month as the main drivers of continued expansion in the manufacturing sector; the medium-sized PMI was 48.7 per cent, down from 1.7 percentage points in the previous month and in the contraction zone; and the small-scale PMI was 50.4 per cent, up from the previous month.
China's index of non-manufacturing business activity was at 54.9 percent for the month, up 0.7 percentage points from the previous month and picking up for the second straight month.
Zhao Qinghe believes that the non-manufacturing industry as a whole continues to maintain a steady and positive momentum of development.
The index of business activity in road transportation, securities, real estate and other industries has remained below the critical point, and the total volume of business has decreased.
Nagoya, Japan, November 5 (UPI) -- Bank of Japan President Haruhiko Kuroda said Monday the central bank is aware that long-term ultra-loose monetary policy could squeeze financial institutions' profit margins and potentially destabilize the country's banking system.
But he said the Bank of Japan needed to maintain its large-scale stimulus program in light of low inflation and uncertainty in overseas economies, while keeping a close eye on the pros and cons of its policies.
"The Bank of Japan fully acknowledges that under continued monetary easing, the strength of financial institutions will be increasingly affected," Kuroda said in a speech to business leaders in Nagoya.
He said the banking system could be volatile in the event of a severe negative shock if financial institutions were more proactive in taking risks to compensate for the effects of years of shrinking profit margins due to low interest rates.
"Although these risks are not significant at present, the central bank will keep a close eye on the situation and encourage financial institutions to take the necessary measures," he said.
Minutes of the Bank of Japan meeting, released earlier on Monday, showed the rising cost of long-term easing was discussed by the Bank of Japan's policy committee at a September interest-rate meeting.
The minutes show that one commissioner said that if the economy continues to expand, "the Bank of Japan will have more room for flexibility in policy in the future."
According to the minutes, another member said the committee should discuss how long the Bank of Japan could keep the stimulus in place, given its limitations over the duration of the policy.
Mr Kuroda said the Bank of Japan would assess the financial risks of easing policies, while also taking into account the uncertainty surrounding Japan's economic outlook, which could affect global demand as a result of trade frictions and rising protectionism between China and the US.
"The impact of such problems on Japan's economy is, for the time being, limited," Kuroda said.
"But how the problem persists and the impact on Japan's economy is likely to be greater," he added.
"There is a need for strong monetary easing on a sustained basis, while considering both positive and negative effects in a balanced manner," Kuroda said.
Despite the growing malaise of aggressive stimulus programs, such as long-term low interest rates, which have eroded the profits of financial institutions, low inflation has forced the Bank of Japan to maintain the program.
The Bank of Japan maintained monetary policy last month; in the face of the risks posed by a global trade war, Mr Kuroda ruled out a near-term rate hike.
1, 2018, in Cardiff, United States, the corporate logo on Tesla's electric vehicle.
Under a settlement agreement, Tesla Motors and its chief executive, Mask, have agreed to each pay a $20 million fine to financial regulators, and Mask will step down as chairman of the company but remain CEO.
The settlement deal will mark the end of a tumultuous two months for Tesla.
The settlement of the securities fraud charges, disclosed Saturday by the Securities and Exchange Commission, will breathe a sigh of relief to investors.
Investors had feared the protracted legal battle would only further hit the electric-car company, which is still losing money.
The SEC on Thursday sued Mask for fraud, saying its August 7 tweets misled investors.
He tweeted that he was considering privatizing Tesla for $420 a share and had already secured financing.
The SEC said the tweets were in fact unfounded and that the market turmoil they triggered had hurt investors.
Investors and corporate governance experts said the agreement could strengthen Tesla, which has been hit hard by Musk's recent behavior.
Steven Heim, head of asset management at Boston Commons, said the settlement should have put Mask under more scrutiny, while not taking the "devastating" measures that drove him out of Tesla.
The asset manager holds shares in Tesla's battery maker Panasonic.
Under the proposed deal, Tesla would have to appoint an independent chairman, two independent directors and a board of directors to develop controls on Mask's external communications.
"It is in the best interests of our market and our investors, including Tesla shareholders, that this matter be resolved promptly and on agreed terms," SEC Chairman Clayton said in a statement.
Thursday's charges led to the evaporation of about $7 billion in Tesla's market capitalisation, which stood at $45.2 billion on Friday, below GM's $47.5 billion.
In the settlement, the SEC retracted its request to remove Mask from the company's position.
Many investors said the penalty would be disastrous.
"I think it's the best possible outcome for all involved," said Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial Partners, who gave Tesla a "neutral" rating and said the SEC penalty was a "light penalty" for Mask.
"His continued role as CEO is important to Tesla," the company said in a statement.
Neither Musk nor Tesla acknowledged or denied the SEC's allegations in the settlement agreement, and did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The settlement agreement still needs to be approved by the court.
Beijing Morning News reporter Wang Ping has learned from the Beijing Construction Industry Group that one of the core buildings of the Beijing World Park Complex in 2019, the Beijing World Park Performing Arts Plaza, will for the first time adopt a multi-color ETFE jigsaw structure, with 5440 square metres of membranes showing deep red, deep green, orange, blue, red and green colors.
According to Liu Changbao, director of the five-building group in Beijing, the building area of the performing arts plaza is 4500 square meters, with a total installed steel capacity of 1,182 tons, and the roof of the steel structure is supported by a suspended steel truss with 26 pieces of parachute-shaped layout, which shows the "butterfly wing" under the tenting of the cable steel winch.
"From the sky overlooking the performing arts plaza, the colorful roof is like a floral, dancing butterfly, and the bright colors do not fade from time to time and the wind and snow."
Previously, monochromatic ETFE membranes had been widely used in nests, water cubes and other projects, but the multi-color jigsaw ETFE membranes were the first in the country.
Journalists have learned that every inch of membrane material is "precious" because there are very few suppliers of multi-color membrane structure production capacity around the world.
In order to avoid overlapping and "fighting" at the end of the cable, Liu said, he will also innovate with a "two-fork-ear" cable-head structure that ensures that the "fight" cable-head bundle is in the right place through a special fixed plug-in.
At present, the construction of the Beijing World Park Park in 2019 is under way.
Among them, the International Pavilion Project has completed all of the "flower umbrella" suspension construction.
It is planned that the project will be ready for exhibition by the end of October.

Abe's proposed cabinet reshuffle for the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) - China-New China Network
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's 2-day cabinet reshuffle and senior party personnel readjustment have entered the final stage of discussions, according to the Kyodo news agency.
The president or general secretary, who is coordinating the election of Mr Abe's crony ex-economic rebirth to four key positions in the party, is now in the process of taking over the role.
Regime-related sources reported on Monday that the information had been leaked.
In the afternoon, Abe held talks at his official residence with Yamaguchi, the head of the Communist Party of the People's Republic of China (CPC).
Yamaguchi called for the land transportation from the Comanche party to be allowed to remain in office.
Abe said "it will be explored."
Yamaguchi revealed the matter to the media.
At noon at his residence, Abe met with the vice-president of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), Masahiko Takamura, on the amendment of the Constitution to demand "hope to continue to help in the future".
Gao is currently serving as a special adviser to the party's constitutional reform and advancement headquarters.
Ganley, known as a proponent of “Abenomics, ” assumed the role of economic rebirth in December 2012, when Abe ’ s second cabinet came to power, but resigned in January 2016 amid a money scandal.
He served as the chief of affairs at the headquarters of Abe's election response in the election of the party's president.
Around the party ’ s four key positions, Abe is interested in keeping the second-ranking prime minister and the head of the government investigation, Yasuhiro Nakamoto, in office.

Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Monday that China's opening door will not be closed until the door is opened, and that the push for a higher level of openness will not stop.
Expanding imports is not an equity measure and is a long-term consideration for the future, with Chinese imports and services expected to exceed $30 trillion and $10 trillion, respectively, over the next 15 years.
In his keynote speech at the first China International Import Expo, Xi said China will further reduce tariffs, accelerate the development of new industries such as cross-border electricians, continuously liberalize market access, promote the opening of services, and ease restrictions on foreign capital stock ratios in areas such as education and health care, where there is a large gap in the domestic market.
China will protect the legitimate rights and interests of foreign-capital enterprises.
He said China would urgently study Hainan's policy and institutional system for building a free-trade port in stages and accelerate the process of exploring the construction of a free-trade port with Chinese characteristics, add a new section of the Shanghai Free Trade Area, set up a science board on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, and register it on a pilot basis to support the development of regional integration in the Yangtze River Delta, and increase it into a national strategy.
“The Chinese economy is a sea, not a small pond, ” he said.
There are times when the wind is calm, there are times when the storm is stormy, "Xi said, adding that" wild storms can topple small ponds, but not the sea.
After countless storms and storms, the sea is still there!
After more than 5,000 years of hardships and hardships, China is still there!
For the future, China will always be here!
He pointed out that economic globalization had suffered setbacks, multilateralism and the free trade regime had been hit, instability and uncertainty remained numerous, and risks and challenges had increased. Open cooperation was an important driving force for strengthening international trade and economic cooperation. Countries should adhere to openness and integration, expand the space for mutually beneficial development and strengthen macroeconomic coordination.
Once again, he stressed that China's opening doors will not be closed, but will only get bigger and bigger, and that the push for higher levels of openness will not stop.
China will stimulate the import potential, adapt to the upward trend of domestic consumption, take more active and effective measures to promote the increase of residents' income and foster the growth of medium and high-end consumption.
China will respect international business practices and treat all types of enterprises registered in China equally and on an equal footing.
China will protect the legitimate rights and interests of foreign-capital enterprises, resolutely punish the infringement of the legitimate rights and interests of foreign investors, especially the infringement of intellectual property rights, improve the quality and efficiency of intellectual property examination, introduce a system of punitive damages, and significantly raise the costs of violation of the law.
Turning to China's economic outlook, Xi said China's economic performance is in a reasonable range, based on key indicators such as economic growth, employment, prices, balance of payments, corporate profits, fiscal revenues, and labor productivity, laying an important foundation for achieving the year-round goal.
Compared with other major economies, China's economic growth is still among the highest in the world.
"The fundamentals of sound and stable economic development in China have not changed, the conditions for the factors of production that underpin high-quality development have not changed, and the overall momentum for long-term stability has not changed."
'everyone can be optimistic about China's economic development prospects, 'Xi said.
According to Xi, China's growing macro-control capacity has many favorable conditions for maintaining long-term healthy and stable development of the economy, and China's economic development has also encountered outstanding contradictions and problems, and measures are being taken to solve them actively, with the results already and now being demonstrated.
"We believe that as long as we maintain strategic stability, deepen reform and opening up in an all-round way, and make great efforts to resolve outstanding contradictions and problems, China's economy will surely be able to accelerate its transition to a high-quality development track," Xi said.

Death toll from strong earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rises to 420, no reports of Chinese citizen casualties
The death toll from the powerful earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia's central Sulawesi province has risen to 420, the official Antara news agency said at midnight local time, citing figures released by Wilem Rampangilei, head of the country's disaster agency.
The official said it was only statistics for the city of Palu, capital of Central Sulawesi province, excluding the Dungara district, where the epicenter was located, and the nearby Sigi district, where communications are still disrupted and no reports of fatalities have been received.
Because many roads in the city of Palu have been severely damaged, heavy machinery has been difficult to access, and search and rescue efforts have encountered great difficulties.
In order to secure the rescue, all commercial flights were suspended after the opening of the 28-night Paru airport, which had been closed, and the flight from Jakarta to Palu, which had been completed that night, was cancelled.
After the earthquake and tsunami, the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia learned to verify the situation of Chinese citizens in the disaster area through various channels.
So far, no reports of casualties among Chinese citizens have been received.
"The supersonic project is being carried out in accordance with the plans of the International Group and the contracts signed with the Ministry of Industry and Trade," said Separo, head of the Central Aerofluid Dynamics Research Institute in Žukovsky, Russia.
We think it will take two to three years for the technology to be demonstrated, and another 10 to 15 years for civilian aircraft to be produced.
The question for Russian scientists at the moment is how to balance the economy and safety of the aircraft, Cerpaolo said.
Supersonic aircraft, he said, are characterised by huge noise impacts.
The institute is working with the Moscow Institute of Aeronautics and the Tupolev Design Bureau to develop a full range of civilian supersonic aircraft, including business and large airliners for commercial transport, Mr. Serpaolo said.
The Secretary-General of Xi Jinping made a very important speech at the symposium of private enterprises, which instilled firm confidence in the private economy as it moved to a broader stage.
General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed that "let entrepreneurs unload their ideological baggage and move forward lightly" has a strong resonance among the vast number of entrepreneurs and innovative entrepreneurs.
The dynamism of the market comes from people, especially from entrepreneurs, and from entrepreneurship.
In the 40 years of reform and opening to the outside world, there are tens of millions of stories of entrepreneurship and innovation, and the growth of the group of entrepreneurs continues to drive China's economy to breaking point.
For some time now, some people in society have spoken in a negative and sceptical way about the private economy.
So-called "private economy off the field theory" "new public-private joint venture theory" and other erroneous statements cause some entrepreneurs to doubt and worry.
Recently, some private enterprises have encountered a lot of difficulties and problems in their management and development.
For example, changes in the international economic environment have had an impact on some export enterprises; rapid adjustment of demand structures has brought about pressure for transformation and escalation; some policies are not coordinated, policy effects are superimposed or work in a simple manner, leading to the opposite effect of some policies that are intended to be good.
A variety of factors are intertwined, the private economy is in difficulty, some private enterprises are facing difficulties, and entrepreneurs are showing a lot of anxiety.
In this context, it is of great practical significance to correct the misunderstanding of understanding, unload the ideological baggage of the entrepreneur, let the enterprise pursue development with one mind, and the government promote development with one mind, so as to affect market confidence and development expectations.
This symposium once again emphasized the important conclusion of "Three No Change": "The status and role of the non-public economy in the economic and social development of our country has not changed!"
In recent years, the CPC Central Committee has paid unprecedented attention to entrepreneurs, from the promotion of decentralization, the establishment of a list of powers, the establishment of a legal environment that protects the legitimate rights and interests of entrepreneurs, the creation of a level playing field, and the creation of an atmosphere in which the whole society respects entrepreneurs.
The symposium also made clear the policy initiatives to support the development of private enterprises in six areas, and launched a series of practical actions aimed at the private enterprises to "light up and move forward".
These are very encouraging to the group of entrepreneurs, and give the community more expectation.
Fog out, the policy has been set, the key is to implement.
It is necessary to create a better development environment for the private economy, help private enterprises to solve their difficulties in development, and help China to achieve economic transformation and upgrading; and let entrepreneurs feel fair in market competition, safe in legitimate business operations, respect in social life, stimulate innovation and create potential.
China's economy is entering the process of high-quality development, requiring more entrepreneurs to develop their ambitions, and providing greater space and stage for entrepreneurs to develop their creativity.
We have reason to believe that, as we further deepen reform and break down obstacles, the private economy will usher in better prospects for development and opportunities for development and move to a broader stage.

Chinese Chicken Soup Exports to China Rise 20-fold in 4 Years: Related to the Increase of Youth in Empty Nest
South Korean Chicken Soup exported more than $100,000 to China last year, up about 20-fold from 2013, four years ago, Yonhap reported on Friday.
According to the analysis, this increase is related to the increase in the number of young people in China's empty nests leading to the promotion of convenience food sales, as well as the increase in the attention paid by young people to nutritious meals.
The data was released on Friday by the Korea Agricultural and Aquatic Food Circulation Commune (AT).
South Korean Chicken Soup exports to China reached $10.0339 million last year, weighing 218.59 million kg, a jump of 2094 percent and 3668.8 percent, respectively, from 2013.
According to the analysis, the increase in sales of Korean Chicken Soup in China is related to the increase in the number of young people in empty nests driving the hot food sales and the increase in the attention paid by young people to nutritious meals.
By the end of this year, one-person households in China have surpassed the 200 million mark and are expected to reach 30% of the population by 2020, with local food companies targeting "single-meal families" for a variety of convenience foods.
In addition, the analysis also said bird flu is the biggest factor preventing the Chinese chicken soup from taking root in the mainland market.
'between November 2016 and April last year, there was an outbreak of bird flu in South Korea, which resulted in a total ban on the export of ginseng broth to China, resulting in a sharp decline in exports, 'it said.
Chicken soup exports to China reached $840,000 in 2016, and exports plummeted to $100,000 last year as a result of bird flu.

That followed May, when the U.S. Navy also had two warships enter the waters near the South China Sea islands that China claims sovereignty over.
Comments from Washington suggest the move could infuriate China at a time when China-US relations are tense.

National Flag Rising Ceremony to Celebrate National Day at China-Vietnam Border Estuary Port
"It is more shocking to think of such a magnificent flag-raising ceremony in the frontier than to watch the flag-raising in the interior," he said.
On the morning of the first day, Mr. Zhang, a tourist from Sichuan to the mouth of Yunnan on the China-Vietnam border, and more than 500 troops, residents and Chinese and foreign tourists attended the flag-raising ceremony to celebrate the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
The estuary port is the largest port in the Yunnan section of the China-Vietnam border. It is located in Hukou County, Honghe County, Yunnan Province. It is located in the same river as the old market in Vietnam.
With the deepening of the construction of the country's "Belt and Road", as one of the most convenient channels for China to connect Southeast Asia, there has been a steady increase in the flow of entry and exit from the estuary ports.
At 7: 30 a.m., the sun was just a corner away, and the estuary's restricted area had gathered early to watch the flag-raising ceremony between local people and Chinese and foreign tourists.
At 0745 hours, the flag-raising ceremony began on time, and members of the guard of honour at the State Gate at the border checkpoint at the mouth of the estuary were in a spirited spirit, escorting the flag to the flag-raising platform at a vigorous pace.
After the commander gave orders to raise the flag, the flag-bearer swung his arm to draw an arc, and the bright five-star red flag spread out like an eagle's wing, slowly rising with the national anthem's strong melody.
"Holding the National Day flag-raising ceremony on every New Year's Day, Spring Festival, National Day and other important time nodes not only shows the image of China, but also inspires the patriotic feelings of the people of all ethnic groups in the frontier areas."
So said the men and women of the honor guard who attended the flag-raising ceremony.
It is reported that the National Guard, which is responsible for the flag raising ceremony at the estuary port, is composed of more than 40 officers and men from various posts at the estuary border checkpoint, ranging from a three-person flag raising team to a large honor guard, which has experienced more than 60 years of history and has carried out more than 70 missions for national foreign affairs since its formation.
The newly revised Personal Income Tax Law has adjusted the standard for the adjudication of individual income tax payers in China from one year to 183 days.
In order to maintain policy stability, the next step in implementing the new personal income tax law will be to consider continuing to make preferential arrangements for people from outside China, including those from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation said on Wednesday.
The person in charge said that the current regulations on the implementation of the personal income tax law have special preferential provisions on the taxation of persons outside China, and that individuals who have no domicile in China but have resided for more than one year and not more than five years may pay individual income tax on their income derived from outside China only in respect of the part paid by units or individuals within China.
The portion paid abroad does not require personal income tax to be paid within the territory of China.
The Ministry of Finance of China, the State Administration of Taxation, the State Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Commerce have also issued notices to expand the scope of application of the policy of withholding pre-tax income tax on direct investment in the distribution of profits by foreign investors.
For profits distributed by foreign investors from resident enterprises within China, the scope of application of the policy of withholding pre-tax income tax on domestic direct investment shall be extended from foreign investment incentive projects to all projects and fields that are not prohibited from foreign investment.
During the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, the parties released a number of positive messages on the Korean peninsula.
South Korea ’ s president, Moon, relayed the DPRK ’ s “irreversible ” resolve to abandon nuclear weapons and said US President Donald Trump and North Korea ’ s supreme leader, Kim Jong Un, could meet before the end of the year.
The US State Department later said Secretary of State Pompeo would visit North Korea in October to push for the implementation of the promise of a meeting between the US and North Korean leaders in Singapore.
From the beginning of this year to the present, the two Koreas have broken the ice to open the path of dialogue, the leaders of the two Koreas and the United States have met, the general trend of easing the situation on the peninsula has continued and the principle of dialogue to resolve the issue of the peninsula has been upheld.
First of all, the question of the peninsula is essentially a security issue. The key to achieving peace on the peninsula is to address the legitimate security concerns of all parties in a proper and balanced manner, rather than simply pressuring the other side and emphasizing its own demands.
Secondly, in the dialogue to realize the denuclearization of the peninsula, the parties concerned are divided on the steps and ways to realize the denuclearization of the peninsula, and the game thinking of "who comes first" is still strong due to the long-standing lack of political trust between the DPRK and the US.
At a recent open meeting of the Security Council on the Korean Peninsula, held at United Nations Headquarters in New York, the different voices around the issue of sanctions against the DPRK once again highlighted the "no change" in these two points on the peninsula.
U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo has insisted that sanctions against North Korea will not be lifted until the Korean peninsula is fully denuclearized.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, for his part, stressed the principle of "responding with action," noting that "the weakening trend in sanctions should be the same as the steps North Korea has taken on the path to a gradual abandonment of its nuclear program."
There is no doubt that the parties concerned should continue to implement the relevant Security Council resolutions in a comprehensive, complete and accurate manner, but pressure is not an end in itself, and the implementation of sanctions and the promotion of a political settlement are the requirements of the Council's resolutions, both of which cannot be ignored and cannot be chosen alone.
As stated by Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, in view of the current positive developments in inter-Korean and Korean-American relations, China believes it is necessary for the Security Council to consider the timely initiation of reversible clauses, thus encouraging the DPRK and other parties concerned to take greater steps towards denuclearization.
In retrospect, the denuclearization of the peninsula and every progress in the peace process will require sufficient political courage on the part of all parties.
At present, in the face of the growing expectations of the international community to promote a political solution to the peninsula issue, the parties concerned should, in particular, demonstrate political courage, make political decisions, implement commitments and resolve difficult problems, take continuous steps in parallel with each other, push forward the process of denuclearization of the peninsula and establish a peace mechanism on the peninsula, and jointly create a permanent peace on the peninsula.
The People's Government of Ji County, Linfen City, Shanxi Province, reported on Monday that during National Day, the Yellow River spout waterfall area in the county will maintain a relatively high water level and do not meet the opening conditions.
In order to ensure safety, the scenic area was temporarily closed during the National Day.

The Yellow River runs at this point, the banks of the stone cliff stand, the mouth of the mouth of the narrow, like a spout, forming the "thousands of Yellow River a pot of harvest" of the manly.
According to the reporter, each June-October is the flood season of the Yellow River. Starting on July 12, 2018, due to the high water level of the Yellow River, the spout area of the Yellow River in Shanxi began to close, so the spout area has been closed for nearly a month.
Ni Yufeng, chief engineer of the Scenic Area Management Committee, told the media that it was the longest stretch of high water levels in the Yellow River in nearly 20 years. "It hasn't been so long before, we closed the flood season in 2017 for four days and this year for nearly a month."

Provision of Influenza Vaccination Services at Health Centres and Health Stations, especially on National Day Holidays
This year, the Health Bureau has ordered 150,000 doses of the four-price influenza vaccine for 2018-2019. At this stage, priority is given to free vaccinations for high-risk people. In order to facilitate influenza vaccination during the holidays, the health centres and health stations under the Health Bureau provide vaccination services from 9 a.m. to 1 noon during the National Day Holidays (1 and 2 October).
In addition to the above measures, since the introduction of the Scheme, the health centres and health stations under the Health Bureau have extended the influenza vaccination service from Monday to Friday to 8 p.m., and as at 4 p.m. on 30 September, 4,158 people had been vaccinated, up from 3,714 in the same period last year.
Free vaccinations are provided to the following Macao residents: Persons aged between 6 months and under 18 years, persons aged 50 years and over, pregnant women, all chronically ill persons, including obese persons (i.e. those with a Body Mass Index BMI of 30 or above), as well as staff of institutions, nurseries, kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, all health workers, and Macao residents working in gaming and entertainment venues.
At the same time, other persons, including the public sector, whom the Health Bureau considers necessary to vaccinate, will contact the relevant agencies on their own initiative to obtain a list and be placed by the health centres for vaccination.
To facilitate vaccinations and reduce waiting times, the Health Bureau will send medical staff to secondary schools, primary schools, kindergartens and nurseries in Australia between October and December this year to carry out collective influenza vaccinations for young children, small and medium-sized children, teachers and staff. In addition, the Health Bureau will arrange for group vaccinations to be carried out in elderly and disabled homes, public sector or other institutions with a large number of staff.
Students and young children who are unable to participate in group vaccinations may receive a Macau Resident Identity Card, a Health Bureau User Card, a Influenza Vaccination Card (if any), a Student Card, an Employee's Card or a Certificate of Profession from the Hong Kong General Hospital, or a Health Centre, starting on 3 December 2018.
The Department of Health reminded residents that people who had been vaccinated against influenza between September 2017 and August 2018 would still need to be vaccinated for a new season starting in September 2018, as the influenza antigen component of the influenza vaccine for the Northern Hemisphere for 2018-2019 has been updated for the Northern Hemisphere winter 2018-2019 and summer 2019 seasonal influenza.
In Macao, flu peaks usually occur between January and March of each year, later than in temperate regions (e.g. North China and Japan), and the Health Bureau has called on people at high risk of complications from influenza, such as the elderly, children, pregnant women, obese people and people with chronic illnesses, as well as those in frequent contact with high-risk people, to be vaccinated as soon as possible.

On the evening of September 29, Beijing time, a group of Chinese and European banliers (Chengdu) loaded with car connectors, binoculars, liquid crystal display screens and other cargo were transferred to Nuremberg, Germany, via the port of Shamianuvka, Poland, for re-loading.
This is the first time that China and the EU have opened a railway line at the Polish port of Sheremianuvka, marking the successful opening of another European transport route in the Central European region, following Mara and Jopu.
The Central European class, which began on 14 September at the Qingbai River City Station in Chengdu, entered Europe via the Arayama Pass, and eventually arrived at Nuremberg, Germany, for a total of about 16 days.
For the first time in the course of China and Europe, the shift operation of the broad rail and the marking track is carried out here.
The opening of the port has effectively solved the problems of long operation and long time caused by the current congestion at the port of Mara, raised the time limit for the transport of the class, and provided a new solution to the problem of congestion at the port of Mara, further improving the carrying capacity and transport efficiency of the western Chinese hinterland to the Euro-Mediterranean market, and laying a solid foundation for the opening of the Central European class to the European market.
More than 400 people have been confirmed dead after a 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday, many of them swept away by tsunami waves triggered by the quake.
Authorities expect the total number of deaths to increase significantly on Sunday as remote areas report new data.
Dozens of people are still reported to be trapped under the rubble of a hotel and a shopping centre in the city of Baru.
Large waves of up to six meters (20 feet) were triggered by the quake that hit the city of Baru.
Only the death toll from Badu so far has been reported slowly in Dungra, north of Badu, and authorities are bracing for a worse situation to emerge.
Dungra, with a population of 300,000, was closer to the epicenter of the quake.
Indonesia's Vice President Kala said the total death toll could rise to thousands.
Hundreds of people gathered at the beach on Friday to celebrate the holiday as the waves hit the coast at dusk. Many people were swept away by the huge waves, which destroyed everything they had to do.
Tokyo, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The confidence of Japan's big manufacturers hit its lowest level in more than a year in the September quarter as a combination of rising raw material costs and a series of natural disasters weighed on production, according to the Bank of Japan's quarterly survey.
The survey shows little evidence that escalating global trade frictions are hitting the confidence of large manufacturers.
But the risk of a full-blown trade war has hit business prospects and could threaten corporate capital spending.
Buoyant capital spending is a bright spot in Japan's economy.
The survey raises questions about the Bank of Japan's view that a robust economic expansion would help drive inflation up to the 2% target, although there are signs that companies are gradually passing on costs to customers.
"With the global trade war raising concerns, confidence among manufacturers tends to stagnate due to slowing exports and weak factory production," said Nan Wuzhi, chief research fellow at the Jin Syndicate Research Institute in Agroforestry.
"Confidence is still high, and because corporate profits are improving and prices are rising, I don't think confidence is going to continue to decline," he said.
The short-term survey showed that the gauge of the big manufacturing boom fell from a positive 21 three months ago to a positive 19 in September, the third consecutive quarter of deterioration.
The median estimate for the market is positive 22.
The big non-manufacturing gauge fell to a positive 22 in September from a positive 24 in June, the first deterioration in eight quarters.
The Reuters survey was positive 22.
The survey showed that the average gauge of the big manufacturing and non-manufacturing booms was stable in December.
Investors were oblivious to the slide in short-term corporate sentiment, with the Nikkei .N225 rising to a 27-year high on Monday as the continued depreciation of the yen helped improve the outlook for Japanese companies' export earnings.
Capital expenditure was robust.
Despite the decline in business confidence, the latest short view highlights the soundness of corporate capital spending plans, which have benefited from renewed capacity and increased investment in robotics and automation to cope with labour shortages caused by an ageing population.
The central bank's short-term survey shows that large companies plan to raise capital spending by 13.4% for the current fiscal year, which ends in March 2019.
The previous short-term survey was 13.6 per cent.
Mr Nan said all corporate capital spending plans for the current fiscal year had grown by 8.5 per cent, close to the pace of Japan's bubble economy.
"There is still room for further growth in capital spending, given that small businesses are increasing their profit estimates from now on, but much depends on the impact of the trade war on business confidence," he said.
The short-term survey, which showed an increase in the ability of companies to pass on costs and a positive 7 for large business output prices, was an encouraging sign of progress in Japan's efforts to combat deflation.
The index, which measures the employment situation of large enterprises, hit minus 23, the hottest level since 1992, highlighting the tightening of the job market.
Benefiting from robust corporate spending, Japan's economy rebounded in the second quarter from a contraction in the January-March quarter.
But the prospect of an export-dependent Japan ’ s economy is clouded by escalating trade frictions in the summer and the disruption of its supply chain by natural disasters.
In dollar terms, imports and exports of services grew by 16.4 per cent.
According to the head of the Department of Trade and Trade, the total volume of imports and exports of emerging services exceeded 1 trillion yuan in January-August, faster than the overall growth rate, according to a news release on the ministry's website.
Of these, emerging services imports and exports totaled 11.383.9 billion yuan, an increase of 20.9 percent, which was higher than the overall growth rate of services imports and exports of 10.4 percentage points, and led to an increase of nearly 3 percentage points in the share of emerging services.
In terms of services exports, in January-August, services exports continued to grow at a rapid pace this year, with exports growing at a 5.7 percentage point faster rate than imports.
Among the top three areas for growth were telecom computer and information services, personal culture and entertainment services, and insurance services, which grew by 61.1 per cent, 38.8 per cent and 26.5 per cent, respectively.
The head of the Department of Trade and Trade also pointed out that the proportion of imports of emerging services increased gradually between January and August.
In January-August, imports of emerging services grew rapidly, accounting for 23.6 percent of imports of services, up 1.6 percentage points from the same period a year earlier.
Among them, imports of financial services, intellectual property royalties, telecoms computers and information services all grew by more than 20 per cent, at 47.1 per cent, 23.3 per cent and 23.2 per cent respectively.

Oil prices or a "three-way rise" in the national day of self-driving travel can be filled with oil ahead of schedule.
Beijing, September 30 (Xinhua) -- At 2400 hours on September 30, a new round of price adjustment window for refined oil will be opened in tandem with the National Day holiday.
A number of agencies forecast a sharp increase in oil prices to achieve a "three-way increase."
Owners who plan to drive on their own can fill their cars with oil before the price rises.
According to the data calculated by Roundup Information, an increase of about 190 yuan / ton is expected for domestic refined products, and 220 yuan / ton is estimated for Zhuang Jiaotong Information.
In September, the price of oil has been raised twice: 180 yuan / ton for gasoline and 170 yuan / ton for diesel on September 3, 145 yuan / ton for gasoline and 145 yuan / ton for diesel on September 17.
Domestic oil prices are tied to international oil prices, which have rallied since the current pricing cycle, and Brent crude has continued to look beyond the $80 mark.
U.S. WTI crude futures were up $1.13 at $73.25 per barrel at the close of trading on September 28.
Brent crude futures were up $1.0 at $82.72 a barrel.
"In terms of the international situation, tensions such as US sanctions on Iran have been superimposed and oil prices have been moving more strongly overall, followed by a clear refusal at the OPEC production cut meeting to increase production, giving confidence to the market, and a steady upward shift in oil prices," said the statement.
Zang Wen-Gang, an analyst with Chuang Jiaotong Information Products, said.
On the retail side, the current prices of petrol stations 92 and 95 in Beijing are 7.66 yuan / L and 8.15 yuan / L, respectively, for PetroChina and Sinopec.
According to Mr. Li, an information analyst, there has been little change in the retail promotion strategy for petrol stations, with preferential margins of 0.5-0.7 yuan / L for major stations such as Sinopec and 0.5-1.2 yuan / L for private petrol stations.
"This round of retail prices is on the verge of a three-way increase, with an increase of about $0.14 to $0.16, and private car owners are advised to fill up with oil before the National Day holiday," Li said.

Opening of the 69th International Astronautical Congress in Germany - China New Network
The 69th International Astronautical Congress opened on October 1 at the Bremen Convention and Exhibition Center in Germany, attended by more than 6,300 astronauts, representatives of space agencies and enterprises, experts, scholars and young students from all over the world.
Speaking at the opening ceremony, the President of the International Astronautical Federation, Jean-Yves Legar, said that the global space industry was no longer involving only a small number of countries and institutions and that the number of participants had increased significantly this year compared with the previous one, indicating that an increasing number of institutions and personalities were joining in the process.
He called on all countries to strengthen cooperation and innovation and work together to promote the development of the space industry.
The Vice Minister of Industry and Informatization of China and the Director of the National Space Administration, Zhang Kethrie, presented China's space program at the exchange event and said China will expand international cooperation in the field of space and contribute to the space industry of mankind.
Representatives of China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, China Space Science and Technology Corporation and other relevant organizations, as well as a number of private enterprises, attended the meeting to showcase the latest achievements of China's spaceflight, including launch vehicles, satellites and space science and technology applications.
The International Astronautical Congress, which has been held annually since 1950, is the largest event in the world's aviation community.
The Congress is a five-day event co-sponsored by the International Astronautical Federation, the International Academy of Astronautics, the Centre for Applied Science, Technology and Microgravity Studies of the University of Bremen, the International Institute of Space Law and others.
Beijing, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Canton Fair shows that China's foreign trade situation remains complex and challenging, with 80.6 percent of companies expecting exports to be better or flat in 2018, according to a press release issued Sunday by the China Foreign Trade Center.
However, considering the external environment in which the cost of domestic raw materials, labor and other comprehensive factors continue to rise and trade frictions between China and the United States increase, the exhibitors at the same time believe that the export situation next year is not optimistic.
At the closing press conference of the 124th Canton Fair, Xu Bing, deputy secretary-general, press spokesman and deputy director of the China Foreign Trade Center, said the number of overseas buyers and export transactions at the current Canton Fair had declined slightly year-on-year.
The current purchasers came in at 189,812, from 215 countries and territories, down 1.11 per cent year-on-year.
Exports closed at 206.94 billion yuan ($29.86 billion), down 1 percent year-on-year.
From the market, deals for Japan, ASEAN Ten, BRIC and South Korea were up 74.4 per cent, 11.4 per cent, 7.2 per cent, and 2.5 per cent, respectively, while traditional markets such as the US, Australia, Canada and the EU were down 30.3 per cent, 8.9 per cent, 7.3 per cent and 0.8 per cent respectively.
In terms of industry, transport, mechanical equipment, construction and decorative materials, electronic consumer goods and information products, bathroom equipment grew by 24.8 percent, 21.1 percent, 20.0 percent, 15.1 percent, and 7.6 percent, respectively, while textile clothing and household appliances fell by 13.0 percent and 6.7 percent.
Xu said that, as a barometer of China's foreign trade and a weathervane, the participation of buyers at the current Canton Fair and export transaction data show that China's foreign trade development will still face many uncertainties and uncertainties next year.
However, with the further development of supply-side structural reforms and the recent introduction of national and local policy measures such as "six stability", the new dynamic energy of China's foreign trade development is gathering speed, and new progress has been made in the diversification of the enterprise market, which is an important foundation and a strong condition for the development of foreign trade.
"Taking into account the various factors, it is expected that China's foreign trade imports and exports will continue to grow steadily throughout the year, and the quality and benefits will be further improved," Xu said.
China's General Administration of Customs reported a 14.5 percent year-on-year increase in US dollar-denominated exports in September, a 14.3 percent year-on-year increase in imports, a $316.9 billion trade surplus in September and the highest export growth and trade surplus since February.
Despite escalating trade frictions between China and the United States, China ’ s export performance in September was significantly higher than expected, with exuberant external demand, an increase in the value of the renminbi before US tariffs were imposed, or major supporting factors, showing some resilience in China ’ s foreign trade, but the impact of the Sino-US trade war on confidence and the impact on the industrial chain cannot be underestimated, and analysts believe that the challenge of China ’ s foreign trade could manifest itself in the fourth quarter or the next year.
The Reuters survey showed that U.S. fund managers in September recommended an increase in cash holdings and continued to be cautious as the United States and China began the latest round of reciprocal import tariffs and the dispute showed no signs of easing.
But the 12 fund managers who took part in the survey suggested that the North American asset allocation rose to its highest level since June 2017, while holdings in the UK, the eurozone and especially emerging markets fell.
The global share allocation averaged 56.6 per cent, with bonds accounting for 35.5 per cent, largely in line with last month's survey.
Its most notable change was that the cash allocation ratio rose to 5.1 per cent, the highest since December 2014.
"Some economic data has given confidence to the market, but the trade war is still the biggest worry, so it's best to be prepared to enter when the market falls back," said a fund manager at a large fund firm.
But fund managers continued to favor stocks in September, especially in the United States, even as U.S. stocks were considered to be overpriced.
Today, in Shanghai, China's opening landmark, the world's first large-scale import-themed national exhibition, the China International Import Expo, has officially kicked off in the midst of a huge crowd of people expecting it to be the first of its kind.
An exhibition is like a "window" that gives the world a better understanding of a city and a country.
Through this "window" of the Expo, people see a move towards a higher level of "open China"; with this "window" of the Expo, we welcome the world and China's "reform and opening to the outside world" for mutual benefit and win-win.
"For a country, opening up is like breaking a cocoon into a butterfly, but it will take a while, but it will get a new life."
General Secretary Xi Jinping's summing-up of the road to openness points out an important reason why "China can."
Looking back on the 40 years of reform and opening-up, China, which has dared to enter the world market, has, despite its vortex and waves, always faced all risks and challenges with an open attitude, continuously released its endogenous momentum and continuously improved its competitiveness.
It can be said that China, with its own solid achievements, strongly interprets the value and significance of openness.
Standing at a new historical starting point, the holding of the import-themed Expo is a major decision taken by the CPC Central Committee, with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, to push forward a new round of high-level opening to the outside world. It is a major initiative by China to open its markets to the world. It is a practical action by China to support economic globalization and trade liberalization, demonstrating the strong and clear will of "China's open door will not be closed, only to expand."
It is the greatest affirmation and the best response to China's broader, wider and deeper development of an open economy that exhibitors from all over the world have signed up for, and the "one-size-fits-all" booth is "one-size-fits-all".
More importantly, the current global economic and trade order has reached a crossroads.
Some countries have built up walls of trade protectionism and returned to the old path of unilateralism, increasing the international community's anxiety about the prospects for free trade and adding a lot of uncertainty to the world economy, which is returning to a warmer climate.
Against this background, the event on the banks of the Huangpu River embodies China's defence of free trade, allowing the world to see open markets and share the future of China's self-confidence and China's assumption of the role.
Go it alone, go it all the way.
China's open-mindedness and embrace of the world have not only greatly promoted its own development, but also brought to the countries and regions of the world a booming "China opportunity".
In recent years, China has advocated and promoted the co-establishment of the Belt and Road, the launching of the AIIB and the establishment of the Silk Road Fund... China has provided a range of international public goods, provided real export markets, development opportunities and jobs, and allowed enterprises from various countries to take the China Express to develop the 鈥渢he car鈥?
The Expo is also such a public product, a large platform for global economic and trade cooperation.
On this platform, more than 3,000 enterprises in more than 130 countries and regions have taken a new step forward in the Chinese market with their unique and high-quality products and services.
In addition to national firms, there are domestic consumers who really benefit.
By setting up this platform, it provides a multi-channel quality supply for consumption upgrading to meet the people's individualized, diversified and differentiated consumption needs.
With the opening of China's doors, the flow of goods, and the best use of goods, the steps towards a better life will be more solid.
From a broader perspective, the significance of the Expo has gone beyond the sphere of economy and trade, focusing instead on the future, conveying the concepts of openness, inclusiveness, inclusiveness, balance and win-win, and forming a common understanding of how to jointly address today's challenges.
The world is good, China is good; China is good, the world is better.
We hope that the Expo will bring the world a wonderful and successful future, and we look forward to a higher level of "open China" and the world to work together to build a glorious future for the Community of Human Destinations.
Foreign media: The United States and Canada reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The agreement includes the opening of Canada's dairy market to the United States, as well as the temporary non-imposition of tariffs by the United States on Canadian-made cars.
A Canadian source said on the evening of Sept. 30 local time that the United States and Canada had reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), according to foreign sources.
The deal, it was revealed, includes Canada opening up its dairy market to the United States, as well as the United States temporarily not imposing tariffs on Canadian-made cars.
Last month, the United States and Mexico announced a preliminary agreement in principle to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), but the United States and Canada failed to reach an agreement by the 31 August deadline set by the United States to extend negotiations until 30 September.
Previously, a spokesman for Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland said Canada would only sign favorable agreements "focused on the substance, not the timetable, and we will continue to consult in the hope of reaching an agreement that is in Canada's national interest."
More than 90 per cent of Brazilian women voters said that the presidential candidates did not take into account the needs of women.
Data released recently by the National Institute of Geography of Brazil (IBGE) show that more than 90 percent of Brazilian women do not believe that presidential candidates take women's needs into account, according to the Network of South American Expatriates.
The number of women in Brazil now stands at 107 million, according to the report, and if all of Brazil's women are brought together to form a country, the country's population will be ranked 13th globally, more than twice the size of Spain's entire population.
In Brazil, female voters make up 52 percent of the total electorate and men 48 percent, and while women make up a very high percentage of the electorate, in Brazil's Congress they make up just 10 percent of the electorate.
Of the 193 countries in the world, Brazilian women are ranked only 154th in politics, higher than Arab countries.
After more than 20 years of struggle for rights, Brazilian women have still not succeeded in gaining the rights they deserve.
Natalia Mori, a Brazilian sociologist, points out that the reason for this phenomenon lies in the combination of ancient patriarchal societies, racism and capitalist values.
"Politics is supposed to consist of citizens claiming civil rights, identity, access to public goods and the formation of a society of multiple social groups, but Brazilian politics is a monopoly of one group, and the majority of the population is not represented," he said.
A previous study by the Brazilian Institute of locomotives (Locomotiva) also noted that 94 per cent of Brazilian women do not feel that elected politicians can represent their rights, 90 per cent do not agree with the decisions made by politicians and 93 per cent do not agree with the current government's policy on governance.
"We need to reverse the under-representation of women in parliament, and the Brazilian political system continues to be affected by inequality. So far, there is still serious gender, class and racial discrimination in Brazil's political sphere," said Natalie Murray.
Despite the lack of women's rights, the majority of Brazilian women still believe in the power of democracy.
According to the survey, 76 per cent of women believe that they can make a difference in democratic elections and 72 per cent are interested in politics.
In addition, 55 per cent of women believe that democratic politics is the best way to expose women to less prejudice.
Astana, China, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan held a solemn flag-raising ceremony on October 1 to welcome the 69-year-old from New China.
All the librarians of the Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan, the press organizations stationed in Kazakhstan, financial institutions, Chinese-owned enterprises, overseas Chinese, Confucius Institute and foreign students represented more than 80 people in the event.
On October 1, the Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan held a flag-raising ceremony to greet the 69-year-old Chinese in New China.
On the 69th birthday of the great motherland, we held a national flag-raising ceremony in a foreign country, which was a profound patriotic education event, said Zhang Xiao, China's ambassador to Ha after the flag-raising ceremony.
Although we have been living abroad for a long time, but the heart is the great motherland at all times.
Zhang said the Chinese nation is closer today than ever before to the great goal of national rejuvenation, and closer to the center of the world stage than ever before.
"Our mission, our responsibilities and our work are more honorable, arduous and onerous than ever before," the statement read.
Zhang stressed that we should not forget our first thoughts, keep in mind our mission, push the CPC to build the "Belt and Road" in a stable way, go further and further, draw a more beautiful co-construction "Belt and Road", and dedicate all our strength to the development of the motherland and the bilateral cooperation and cooperation between the two countries.
The T2 terminal of the two-river international airport in Guilin, Guangxi, was officially opened on 30 March.
Zhao Le Qin, secretary of the Communist Party of China's Guilin Municipal Committee, said the new terminal, which can meet the needs of 12 million passengers per year, has built up a new air traffic advantage in Guilin and is of great significance for further improving the modern three-dimensional traffic pattern of Jianghai, sea-iron intermodal, water-land and air-port links in Guangxi.
Guilin is expected to receive more than 90 million visitors this year.
The expansion of the T2 terminal and the platform facilities at Guilin International Airport is a major public welfare project for the 60th anniversary of the founding of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and an iconic project for the construction of the Guilin International Resort.
The project began in December 2015 with a total investment of RMB3,258 million, covering a total area of 100,000 square metres, and was completed to meet the needs of 12 million passengers per year, 10.12 million takeoffs and 95,000 tons of cargo and mail throughput.
On the same day, more than 200 flights took off at the T2 terminal at the two-river international airport in Guilin.
The design of the new terminal is inspired by Guilin mountains and waters. It looks like a "mountain and water crown". It looks like a "dragon ridge terraced terraced field" and the eaves of the north Guilin people's house. It is a beautiful view of the river.
According to the report, the new terminal of Guilin airport can meet the peak flow rate of nearly 4,000 arrivals and exits per hour, using intelligent baggage sorting system, security integration platform, human face recognition and other "smart air port" technology, and planning a business district that covers a wide range of businesses such as catering, shopping, duty-free and leisure.
With growth in Europe, Asia and emerging markets largely uninspiring, the United States is increasingly becoming the main engine of global economic growth.
A container freighter moored at the port in New Jersey, United States, on September 23, 2018.
But the economy has also come under close scrutiny as the country's current growth has benefited from the timing of the fiscal stimulus of tax cuts.
"As the United States is returning to full employment, a downturn in the economy is inevitable," he said.
The only question, he said, is when it will happen and, in his view, may only push back sooner rather than later.
While Barclays is optimistic about the outlook for the US economy before the end of the year, the bank admits it is more difficult to make forecasts for farther afield.
"In the absence of more sustainable investment growth to boost the growth potential of the economy, the growth currently stimulated by fiscal policy will be unsustainable," Barclays economists said in a research note.
"At a time when there is a lack of investment growth, the risk of a hard landing for the economy in 2020 will rise," they said.
A series of business surveys will broadly show that the major economies are in the economic cycle phase at the end of the third quarter.
The eurozone and US manufacturing surveys, due to be released next Monday, will come under scrutiny, with the services sector survey due to be published on Wednesday.
But the focus of next week's data will inevitably be on US non-farm employment data, due to be released next Friday, which will provide clues as to whether the tight job market is driving a big pay rise.
Its importance is important not only for the profitability of companies and the purchasing power of consumers, but also because the rise in wages or the rise in headline inflation may be troubling to Federal Reserve / FED officials.
“Pay is going to get a lot of attention because it is likely to rise significantly again from the month before, ” he said.
An increase in September from a year earlier may not break through 3 per cent, but we can fully expect to break through next month, "the ING economist wrote in a research note.
European politics are likely to be a source of market volatility at a time when China and the rest of Asia are on holiday, leading to a lackluster data outlook for the region next week.
The Italian government has ignored previous financial commitments to the EU, and other EU member states will have to quickly determine whether or not to firmly oppose the Italian decision, which he does not support and which he wants to abide by EU rules.
As Brexit negotiations enter a crucial phase, the annual meeting of the British Conservatives in Birmingham may also spark a spate of sparks.
Meanwhile, with Brazil holding its much-anticipated presidential election next weekend, concerns around emerging markets are unlikely to abate.
When the ship is built, it will be delivered to the East China Sea Branch of the State Oceanic Administration of China, said Chen Jian, head of the observation department of the Marine Early Warning and Monitoring Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China, adding that it will be of great significance for the development of China's offshore ocean observing system and the advancement of global ocean observation.
On September 29, China's first 3,000-ton large buoy ship, the Yingyang Red 22, was launched into the waters of China's Wushu Group.
When completed, the ship will break the current bottleneck in China's equipment in large buoys, submersible layout, recovery, and repair.
The "Yingyang Red 22" wheel is mainly used for regular inspection and maintenance, regular placement and recovery of buoys / latent markers, emergency placement of buoys / latent markers, recovery and repair, and has the capability to carry out comprehensive marine survey tasks such as cross-sectional survey.
The new vessel is 89 m in length, 18 m in width and 7.2 m in depth, with a continuation force of 10,000 nautical miles.
"The Yingyang Red 22 is the first large buoy operating vessel in China and the only one in the country with the capability to lift 10 meters of large buoy, which will further enhance our large buoy safeguarding capability," said Wang Weiling, deputy general manager of Wushu Group.
It is understood that when completed, the ship will be delivered to the East China Sea Branch of the State Oceanic Administration of China, and Chen Jian, head of the observation department of the Marine Early Warning and Monitoring Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China, said the ship's use would be of great significance for the development of China's offshore ocean observing system and the advancement of global ocean observation.
"The vessel, which also has a large-scale buoy placement and maintenance operation and an integrated marine survey capability, is the first integrated ship in the country dedicated to the operations of the Central and Far Seas buoys and the Integrated Marine Survey," said the spokesman.
With such a buoy-operated ship, in the future our ocean observations and ocean surveys have a powerful weapon, "he said.
Qingdao, China, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The first race day of the 2018 International Extreme Sailing Series, scheduled to begin on September 30, has been postponed to October 1, and a pre-race meeting was held at the Qingdao Sailing Center, where 12 water wing sailing team captains from six countries and regions made their first appearance.
Under the influence of Typhoon Tam Mei, strong winds continued in the harbour pool, with maximum winds of up to 24 knots. The departure signal was delayed for nearly 90 minutes from 1: 00 p.m. on the 30th, and the wind speed was still not lowered. Anne Mendrandt, the chief judge of the event, announced the cancellation of the first day of the competition, which was postponed until the afternoon of October 1.
"The strong winds coming from the shore continued, and the sea conditions were just too strong," he said.
"In a situation like this, no one knows when the gusty wind is blowing toward the racing boat," Mendrandt explained.
Close to the city's playing field, in terms of the current wind conditions, it's the smartest option to cancel the game, "he said.
There was still some disappointment among all the crew who were ready.
"The boat is ready to stop, and we're in good shape," he said.
"But I know it's the right time to reschedule the game, and I hope the wind is smaller today, so we can do it," said Max Richardson, the Qingdao team's helmsman.
"Losing a day instead makes the game a lot more interesting," said Omica Wilkinson, a "Star of Hope" who has been hailed as the New Zealand team for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
Because the weight of today's game will increase, and there will be only two days left for the game.
People are going to be especially desperate, "he said.
Despite the strong sea breeze, Pierre Ives Durand, the pilot of the French ABM team, told a pre-match meeting about his warm relationship with Qingdao, the venue of the competition: Five years ago, the International Extreme Sailing Series suffered an accidental injury and a broken muscle, and thanks to the treatment of the local tournament medical team, he was able to stand at the venue today, five years later.
The International Extreme Sailing Series was founded in 2007 as a World Sailing League event with the likes of Volvo, the Copa America and the World Sailing Tournament.
The Qingdao station competition will feature FlyingPhantom, the "flying ghost" of the water wing, with two-body sails.
The year 2018 marks the eighth year that the event has landed in Qingdao, the "sailing capital", and the Qingdao station is also in the battle for the series.
Despite the continued turmoil in global financial markets, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said Monday that foreign exchange funds' investment income fell 97 per cent year-on-year in the third quarter of this year, better than in the previous quarter, as overseas stocks rose and foreign exchange losses narrowed markedly under the Sino-US trade war.
According to the latest data from the HKMA, the foreign exchange fund recorded investment income of HK $1.6 billion in July-September 2018, which was significantly lower than the HK $61.8 billion recorded in the same period last year, but better than the revised HK $100 million recorded in the second quarter of this year.
At the start of the Sino-US trade war, Hong Kong and emerging market stock indexes ran counter to the US stock index until the US stock market index peaked in late September and early October, when market sentiment began to reverse, as investors became aware that the trade war was bad for the US itself, Kim said in a speech to the Legislative Council.
"A change in market sentiment is a good thing, and if there is only one-sided impact from a trade war, it will not help much to resolve things," he said.
But he also noted that “if the Sino-US trade war is not resolved, financial market volatility will continue to rise. ”
In the third quarter of this year, the foreign exchange fund's equity investment losses in Hong Kong narrowed from the previous quarter by 8 per cent to HK $4.7 billion, while overseas equity returns increased by 172 per cent to HK $12.8 billion, while foreign exchange losses of HK $16.2 billion and bond yields of HK $9.7 billion decreased by 24 per cent and 31 per cent, respectively, reflecting a general increase in the dollar against major currencies during the quarter and a 3 per cent rise in the US fruit rate in September.
The Exchange Fund is mainly used to support the Hong Kong dollar.
Hong Kong has implemented the Hong Kong dollar-to-United States dollar peg since 1983.
In response to the current financial situation in Hong Kong, Mr Chan said economic and asset market uncertainty had increased and downside risks had increased, but Hong Kong's financial system was robust, defensible and earthquake-resistant.
“Hong Kong ’ s international investment position is abundant, with a net external asset value of $1.4 trillion equivalent to four times GDP, more than 2.5 times that of Singapore and 0.6 times that of Japan, and more than enough to cope with the downturn or reverse it. ”
Mr Chan pointed out that the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate had risen by more than 400 basis points on September 21, which was widely believed to be related to the rise in the Hong Kong dollar, and that the Hong Kong dollar was hovering around 7.80-7.84, until the recent decline in the Hong Kong dollar, and the widening of the US dollar spread, could attract the market to the Hong Kong dollar and buy the dollar for a further period of weaker exchange opportunities.
But he believes the future of the Hong Kong dollar's interest rate below the US dollar will change as the Hong Kong bank's rate hike cycle begins and the Hong Kong dollar rates normalize.
"Hong Kong dollar interest rates will be more in line with US dollar interest rates, and we must be more careful in managing risk and be prepared to deal with market volatility," he said.
Three-month interest rates fell 0.9 per cent to 2.08179 per cent on Monday, from 46 basis points to 51 basis points, while one-month interest rates hit five-month lows, from 120 basis points to 127 basis points.
From mid-May to mid-September, the spot exchange rate for the Hong Kong dollar was mostly close to 7.85 to the dollar.
During the period, the weak exchange guarantee was triggered several times in May and August, after it was first triggered in April, due to factors such as the outflow of some of the funds from the Hong Kong dollar after the hedging activity and the completion of the large-scale prospectus.
The HKMA buys the Hong Kong dollar at a level of 7.85 and sells the US dollar to maintain the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate in accordance with the linked exchange rate system.
The HKMA bought about HK $52.1 billion in May and August under the weak-side exchange guarantee mechanism.
Does the new tax law have any advantages for people from outside the country?
In order to maintain policy stability, the next step in the implementation of the new personal income tax law will be to consider continuing to make preferential arrangements for people from overseas, including those from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, the head of the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation said in a 30-day interview.
A reporter asked, the newly revised personal income tax law of our country individual income tax resident taxpayer judgment standard from the full year to the full 183 days.
Is there any preferential arrangement for people from overseas, including those from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, when implementing the law next?
In response, the person in charge said that the existing regulations on the implementation of the personal income tax law have special preferential provisions on the taxation of persons outside China, and that individuals who have no domicile in China but have resided for more than one year and not more than five years may pay individual income tax on their income derived from outside China only in respect of the part paid by units or individuals within China.
In order to maintain policy stability, the next step in implementing the new personal income tax law will be to consider continuing to make preferential arrangements for people from overseas, including those from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, the head of the department said.
There is no "threshold" for the centerpiece: Quality certification prompts the upgrading of quality.
With the "two-child economy" pull, the mother-and-child market boom, from the north wide to the three-fourth line of cities, all over the country have sprung up various levels of the monthly clubhouse.
At the same time, there is no threshold for this institution, and there is still a gap in the regulation. The cost of the fee varies from tens of thousands to tens of thousands of yuan.
The State Administration of Market Supervision recently launched a national "Quality Month" series of activities in 2018, and journalists visited a five-star monthly children's center in Tianjin for the certification experience of mother and child care services.
The general crescent center provides neonatal care, nutritious meals, postpartum prosthetic plastic and other services.
At this month's children's center, the reporter saw the nurse daily check the newborn breast-feeding, the professional nurse provides the newborn with the fine nursing services such as bathing, touching, and so on.
At the same time, in order to meet the needs of new mothers, from the initial wound care, to the mid- and late-menstrual beauty care services, provide Chinese medicine treatment and beauty care programs to help mothers regain their good looks.
A new mother at the residence told reporters she had been booked into the monthly clubhouse eight months ahead of schedule.
The services of the MSC have a direct impact on the comfort level and physical recovery during the period of the mother's child. Some small monthly clubs can provide only a few simple monthly services. There are hidden problems such as unhygienic sterilization, susceptibility to cross-infection, and single unscientific diet.
The head of the monthly sub-center said they were the only one of all five-star monthly sub-centres in Tianjin to have been certified for B-level services.
"While some customers do not understand the meaning of B-level certification at first, it is important for the long-term development of the enterprise that they benefit from rigorous and standardized process management through certification," he said.
'Service certification is a new certification system based on customer perception, attention to organizational quality management and the satisfaction of service characteristics. It is an important part of the national quality infrastructure and plays a positive role in increasing the proportion of quality service supply and enhancing the international competitiveness of China's services, 'said Pan Liffen, deputy director of the certification supervision department at the State Administration of Market Supervision.
From 2004 onwards, after more than 10 years of development, the service certification project has gone through a process of gradual development, with the emergence of a number of influential service certifications such as financial service certification, mother-and-child care service certification, commodity after-sales service certification, e-commerce service certification, health service certification and so on.
According to the General Administration of Market Supervision, there are now more than 130 service certification institutions in China, more than 2,000 service certification personnel, and nearly 8,000 valid certification certificates.
Mr Pan said it was necessary to further guide and promote the development of service certification, gradually expand service certification coverage in areas such as health, education, sports, finance and electronic commerce, and promote supply-side reform and quality improvement in the service sector.
Hong KONG, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong property prices have fallen for two consecutive months after peaking, Hong Kong Monetary Authority President Chen Delin said on Monday, adding that it would take time to see if the housing market had entered a downward cycle and, if confirmed, consider easing the tightening of counter-cyclical measures in due course.
Mr Chen also pointed out that if property prices were to be reversed, those who would be most affected would be those who were in the market during the peak period, but the chances of a sharp fall in property prices during the Asian financial turmoil in 1997 and a sharp sell-off in public prices were expected to be much lower.
Mr Chan, who led a number of senior members of the HKMA to attend the Legislative Council briefing, said that if it was confirmed that the housing market was entering a downward cycle, it would be possible to relax the measures in due course.
"But with only a few weeks to go, it is still too early to relax and it will take more time to see if the housing market goes into a downward cycle," he said.
Since 10 2009, the HKMA has introduced eight rounds of counter-cyclical measures to significantly tighten mortgages for all types of properties, including reducing the number of mortgages, and adopting rigorous stress tests to improve bank risk management and anti-seismic capabilities.
With Hong Kong officially entering a rate hike cycle, the index of private residential property prices fell for the second month in a row in August-September, extending its monthly decline to 1.44 per cent.
But the cumulative rise in the first three quarters of the year is still 10.2 per cent.
In the second quarter of this year, the proportion of households living without a mortgage in Hong Kong was 66 per cent, higher than the 2009-11 average of 60 per cent, and the contribution-to-income ratio of new mortgages was 47 per cent and 34 per cent respectively, a marked improvement from 64 per cent and 41 per cent respectively in 2009-11, according to the HKMA.
But Mr Chan said the high seismic capacity did not mean that residents who were already in business would not be hurt by the downturn, as property valuations would fall and those who bought buildings during peak periods would bear the brunt of the decline.
Although the HKMA has tightened lending by banks to mortgage lenders, homeowners can also obtain a high percentage of mortgage lending through mortgage insurance or through mortgage loans provided by developers.
Mr Chan said that at present, together with mortgage lending to developers, borrowers could make up to 85-90 per cent of their mortgages, with negative equity (i.e., the market value of a property falling below the level of the total outstanding mortgage loan) if the price of a property falls by as much as 10 per cent.
However, Mr Nguyen, vice-president of the HKMA, pointed out that the authorities' estimate that developers would provide a high number of mortgages, representing only 2-2.5 per cent of the bank's total mortgage portfolio, was still low.
At the peak of negative equity in Hong Kong in 2003, the number of negative assets exceeded 100,000, accounting for 22 per cent of the total number of people in the supply sector.
As of the third quarter of this year, Hong Kong had recorded zero negative equity for the seventh consecutive quarter.
Beijing, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Electronic commerce retail exporters welcomed another wave of tax benefits on October 1, involving VAT, excise duty exemption, and other aspects.
The Ministry of Finance, the State Administration of Taxation, the Ministry of Commerce and the General Administration of Customs have issued a joint communication on the export of goods for which no valid certificates of purchase have been obtained by electric traders in the cross-border e-commerce comprehensive test area, and have tried the VAT and excise duty exemption policies in accordance with the following conditions.

Third, the export of goods does not belong to the Ministry of Finance and the General Administration of Taxation, which, in accordance with the decision of the State Council, expressly cancel the export of goods subject to tax rebates (exemptions).
The notice made it clear that the General Administration of Customs regularly transmits electronic information to the State Administration of Taxation on the declaration list of electronic commerce export commodities.
The tax authorities of each comprehensive test area shall strengthen the tax-free administration of export goods in accordance with the electronic information of the list of export goods declared by the State Administration of Taxation.
The notice states that the specific tax exemption management measures are to be formulated by the provincial tax authorities' financial and commercial departments.
The Office of the Leading Group and the competent commercial departments shall coordinate and promote communication and coordination among departments and the implementation of relevant policies, speed up the establishment of an electronic commerce export statistics monitoring system, and promote the healthy and rapid development of cross-border e-commerce.
On November 5, a man in Liaoning province killed his lover and threw him to death after a disagreement over the distribution of money, then absconded to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
On May 5, the reporter learned from the public security bureau of Dongsheng District of Ordos City, Inner Mongolia, that after a joint police investigation between the two countries, the man was successfully captured.
On June 26, 2018, a woman disappeared in Anshan City, Liaoning Province, and her family alerted the local police.
After investigation by the police, this is not a simple case of human disappearance, the missing person is very likely to be killed by the lover Wang, the police set up a special unit to carry out further investigation.
On October 30, the team found that Wang, a criminal suspect, may be hiding in the East Shing District of Ordos City, Dongsheng police immediately organized a lean police force to cooperate fully with the Liaoning police in the investigation of the case.
After five days of investigation, the police finally figured out Wang's landing point and combed the people involved in detail.
On November 4, police in both places joined forces to capture the suspect Wang at a digger accessories store in Dongsheng District.
According to Wang, he was in a relationship with a lover of the victim, because White's sister had a large sum of money in his name, and the two decided to take possession of the money for themselves.
On June 22, 2018, Wang and Bai disagreed over the use of the money, and Wang went on to kill a white man in the rental house, decomposing the body and throwing it away.
At present, the criminal suspect Wang has been handed over to Liaoning Anshan police.
The Green Development in Action-themed Train Operation of the "Five Great Development and Good Anhui"
The "Five Development, Good Anhui" theme train, the "Green Development in Action" theme train, was officially put into operation on the 5th day.
In order to demonstrate the outstanding achievements of the construction work of the "Five Great Development and Good Anhui", Hefei Railway Company and the Golden Cuckoo Media and Technology Company jointly designed and produced the "Five Great Development and Good Anhui" series of themed trains.
Among them, the first train, the "Innovative Development in Action" theme train, was officially put into operation on October 1 on the railway line No. 1 in Hefei City.
This on-line theme train selected the blue-green color that symbolizes the landscape, reflecting the vitality, vitality and purity of the feeling.
The publicity highlights the core ideas of the "Five Great Development and Good Anhui" and the 18 representative cases of green development achievements in the province, including those of the Jiangghuai Canal Project, the forestry system, the protection and development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt, and the construction of key green development projects such as the 10 million mu Forest Growth Project.
In addition, the "Coordinated Development in Action", "Open Development in Action" and "Shared Development in Action" three theme trains will also be on line in the near future.
On October 1, the first day of the Mainland National Day "Golden Week" and the last day of the Hong Kong National Day public holiday, many Mainland residents take advantage of the holidays to visit and shop across the country, and many Hong Kong residents return to Hong Kong on the same day.
According to data provided by the Shenzhen Border Inspection Station, at 1600 hours on the same day, the number of people entering and leaving the Shenzhen port reached over 429,000, and the number of transportation tools reached over 168,000, with the ports constantly busy and maintaining a good order of entry and exit.
It is understood that many positive factors, such as the increase in the number of countries offering visa-free exit policies for Chinese citizens, have led to a steady increase in the number of tourists using the National Day holiday to spend their holiday shopping in countries such as Europe and Southeast Asia.
On the morning of January 1, the departure of Luohu, Shenzhen Bay, Huanggang, Fukuda and other ports welcomed the peak passenger (vehicle) flow, which lasted from 9: 00 a.m. to 11: 00 a.m. and from 6: 30 a.m. to 13: 00 noon.
According to the report, in response to the peak flow of incoming and outgoing passengers (vehicles), the Shenzhen Border Inspection Station, in accordance with the unified deployment of the State Immigration Administration, has set up the passenger (vehicle) flow peak-time service mode, arranged the overtime police to support the line of duty, opened the check-in lanes ahead of time, guided passengers and vehicles to conduct orderly check-in, ensured that Chinese citizens' entry and exit queues do not exceed 30 minutes, while taking account of the efficiency of aliens' customs clearance; and enhancing the security in areas where people's intensive flow.
At the same time, the Shenzhen Border Inspection Station reminds incoming and outgoing passengers that they should pay attention to the validity period of their certificates, visas and certificates before travelling, arrange their itineraries rationally, avoid peak periods of passenger flow as far as possible, and choose the right time and the right port to travel.
Passengers travelling to Hong Kong on the Guangzhou-Shenzhen high-speed railway are required to hold valid entry and exit certificates and visa signifiers. High-speed rail tickets are only vehicle certificates and cannot be used as entry and exit certificates. If they are unable to leave for Hong Kong due to non-conformity of the documents, they should follow the guidelines of the border inspection police and wait at designated locations for MTR staff to take them to the Mainland for transport formalities.
Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic troublesome disease with multiple organs throughout the body and has been considered an "incurable disease" in the past.
Because its pathogenesis is unknown, the diagnosis and treatment is difficult, and there is no effective treatment method, so it can not be cured.
Recently, Liu Wanli, a researcher at Tsinghua University's School of Life Sciences, and Chestnut Guoguo, director of the rheumatic immunology center at Beijing University's People's Hospital, found that human immunoglobulins have molecular mutations that increase the susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus, and that the mutations are involved in regulating immune B cells.
In short, the two teams confirmed that an abnormal immune molecule in the human body was an important cause of systemic lupus erythematosus.
According to one of the authors, Sun Xiaolin, of the North Great People's Hospital, the team collected and studied nearly 2,000 cases of systemic lupus erythematosus with large samples, and found that patients with immunoglobulin mutations produced a wide range of pathogenic cells and a large number of autoantibodies, with a significant increase in the incidence and severity of inflammation such as nephritis, arthritis, slurry and vasculitis.
Through a variety of research methods, such as immune cell tracer, animal test and sequencing, the Liu Wanli team found the immune signaling pathways activated by the mutations of the immune molecules and the pathogenic mechanisms that promote the secretion of a variety of autoantibodies by B cells.
The reporter learned that the two teams are strong and united, giving full play to their respective advantages, and realizing the close combination of basic research and clinical application.
Liu Wanli team is committed to B lymphocyte immune identification, immune activation research, the chestnut country team has long been engaged in the clinical study of systemic lupus erythematosus.
"This study is one of the results of many years of collaboration between the two teams, and is the first time that the academic community has recognized that immune globulin gene abnormalities can induce systemic lupus erythematosus, laying a solid foundation for further academic research and clinical targeting."
This is not to protect the short, but to act in accordance with the law.
A lawyer carrying an axe to a court hearing?
The news was really exciting at first, and it blew the pot in the legal circle.
The Central Law of Quanzhou City, Fujian, then fined the lawyers involved 500 yuan, and in writing recommended the Quanzhou Bar Association to investigate and deal with the matter.
The two lawyers' actions do not involve violations of the law and are not punishable in accordance with the law, according to a formal notice issued by the Quanzhou City Law Association, according to the Beijing News.
According to many reports, the management of the Quanzhou Law Association is not to protect short or to engage in confrontation, but to obtain the approval of the Quanzhou Middle Court.
An incident that could have caused tension within the legal community was eventually properly resolved.
The reversal of the matter stems from a more complete restoration of the truth: The axe carried by the lawyer involved is the same style and model as the defendant's murder weapon, but does not open the blade, is used only as supporting evidence at the evidence-proof stage, and does not have the subjective intention of intimidating or "endangering the safety of the court".
There are four very important details to be noted in determining whether the conduct of the lawyer involved was unlawful: First, that the local court had held two previous sessions and had produced only photographs of the axe, which, from a defence point of view, was necessary; second, that the axe had been purchased only one hour before the hearing, not that the lawyer was unwilling to seek the judge's consent, but that he had objectively failed to contact the judge; and that the entire axe had not been misrepresented to the court for four times.
Combining these circumstances, it can be seen that the lawyer involved in the case "with the axe to appear in court" has nothing to do with the act, just for the defence.
After clarifying the whole fact, the Quanzhou City Law Association did not push the boat, but to resist the pressure to make the decision not to punish.
And this decision can stand the test of fact and law.
As for taking the axe, which is used as a control tool, to court without the permission of the court, it is indeed prone to unease and misunderstanding.
For reasons of safety and caution, the previous fines and judicial recommendations of the Quanzhou Central Court are also impeccable.
In order to protect the dignity of lawyers and to prevent the prosecution of lawyers by individual courts, the Supreme Law issued in 2014 the Rules for Security Inspection of Judicial Police of the People's Courts, which established the principle that a lawyer's appearance before a court does not require a personal security check.
Since the rule was issued, lawyers at large have led by example, and there have been few incidents that have endangered the safety of the court because of security gaps.
In rare cases such as Quanzhou, misunderstandings are not difficult to dispel as long as they are communicated in a spirit of mutual respect and understanding.
The Bar Association, as the self-regulatory organization of the bar industry, has the dual mission of disciplining lawlessness and safeguarding legality.
In the past, individual organizations of law and order have been criticized for focusing on discipline and failure to protect them.
And the Quanzhou Law Association's decision, both in terms of process and result, is laudable, setting an example for more of them to do their job correctly.
Which tax benefits will affect our coffers as of October 1?
Shanghai, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The new personal income tax law will come into effect on January 1, 2019. In order to allow the general public to enjoy the tax reduction dividend as soon as possible, the actual salary income of taxpayers will be deducted at the starting point of 5,000 yuan per month from October 1, and the new tax rate scale will be applied.
With the New Deal on the ground, what are the benefits that will affect the masses' money bags?
Good for one: Pay-for-work tax cuts are evident
Taxpayers who receive a salary after October 1 can deduct the basic deductible of $5,000 / month and apply the new tax scale. Most taxpayers have different levels of tax cuts, especially for middle and low-income earners.
According to the tax reduction table for different income groups, for those with monthly income of $8,000, $10,000, $20,000 and $50,000 after deducting the three-risk lump sum, the tax payable after tax reform was $90, $290, $1,590 and $9090 respectively, and the corresponding tax reduction rate was 73.9%, 61.1%, 49.0% and 18.8%, respectively, compared with the monthly threshold of $3,500.
It is worth noting that, for holiday reasons, a new basic schedule of deductible expenses and tax rates may be applied to the wages that units are legally entitled to pay at the end of September, which are due in October.
To this end, the withholding client software, which has been promoted by the tax authorities, has provided the corresponding tax calculation function, but the corresponding tax still has to be declared for payment within the statutory filing period.
Benefit 2: The range of the low-tax bracket is significantly wider
In addition to raising the threshold, the new tax scale will be applied from 1 October.
There has been no change in the seven-step tax rate for wages, salaries and salaries, but there has been a marked change in the range of 3%, 10% and 20%. The range of 25% has been reduced, while the range of 30%, 35% and 45% has remained the same for the higher three-tier.
It is worth noting that the tax law has also adjusted the tax rates for production and operation, with the lower limit of the highest 35% tax rate rising from $100,000 to $500,000.
This means that both individual businesses and sole proprietorships will benefit from the tax changes.
"Judging from the previous estimates of individual tax cuts for Shanghai taxpayers, the dividends of a tax reform will be fully felt by the large number of taxpayers, especially the lower and middle income groups," he said.
Lan Min, head of the personal income tax office of the Shanghai Tax Office of the State Administration of Taxation, said.
Good three: Tax service is more convenient and optimized
Since the promulgation of the new personal income tax law, the taxation department in Shanghai has carried out a series of comprehensive and wide-ranging tax publicity actions.
On the one hand, the key tax sources and key enterprises to carry out "one-to-one, point-to-point" policy guidance.
The tax authorities of Pudong New District have visited major enterprises such as Apple Trading (Shanghai) Co. Ltd., Alipay (China) Network Technology Co. Ltd., Hongxing Mei Kai Long Home Group Co. Ltd., which have a large number of employees, a large amount of withholding work, a large amount of tax payment, and the tax authorities' initiative to advise and solve problems; Xu Huiyuan District Tax Office has visited large labor enterprises in the region, China Financial Consulting Co.
On the other hand, to the general public taxpayer, to carry out the "all-directional, multi-dimensional, stand-alone" tax policy push.
Use Shanghai tax official website, micromail public number, Weibo and other channels to push policy hot spots in a timely manner to ensure that the policy publicity is in place.
At the same time, on September 28, Shanghai Tax Microcredit Public Number 12366 Intelligent Advisory Platform, through the "artificial + intelligent" tax service consultation, launched "target-oriented" intelligent integrated tax reform publicity service.
Beijing, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Former England captain Wayne Rooney will return to the England squad for England's warm-up match against the United States on November 15, the Football Association announced on Thursday night.
Rooney announced his withdrawal from the England squad in August last year.
Rooney, who has made 119 appearances for England and scored 53 goals, is the first goalscorer in the team's history and the second-highest number of appearances in history.

Playing for England is the greatest honour of my career, the 120th and it will be the last time I've played for England and for me it will be a special memory, "he said.
The annual Yangcheng Lake Crab Cultural Tourist Festival kicks off 30 days ago, according to Guan Wenhua, party secretary of the town, which has a net income of more than 600 million yuan ($3.8 billion), the annual economic output of the town's big crab is nearly 3.8 billion yuan.
Yangcheng Lake is also known as the golden claw crab, because the crab body is not muddy, commonly known as the water big sluice crab, green shell white belly, succulent, so there is a reputation for "the king of the crab".
It has become a common practice for people to diet crabs in the golden autumn with the fragrance of red cinnamon.
Big slug crab is the most well-known image spokesman in the city of Ba.
Peeling crab shells, sucking crab feet, picking crab meat, dipping crab, diners feel the beauty of being in the south of the river.
This year, more diners will spend more time in the city, watching egrets catch prey, enjoying the sun and the sun, and enjoying the slow-paced life of the watery countryside.
Due to the widespread introduction of large-scale seedlings in the towns and cities of Pakistan, the size of the sluice crab is much larger this year than in the past.
The crab farmer, who has been dealing with the crabs for nearly 20 years, is planning to export the crab seedlings and breeding techniques from Yangcheng Lake to Thailand to allow food from the countryside to cross national borders and promote cultural exchanges with overseas cuisine.

A three-way trade agreement between the US and Mexico would open up new opportunities for 500 million people.
According to a joint statement by Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland and U.S. Trade Representative Theresa May, published on the Canadian government's website, the United States, Canada and Mexico reached a three-way trade agreement that would be known as the "USMCA" (the U.S.-Mexico Three-Nation Agreement), according to foreign media reports.
Earlier, Canadian CTV News TV quoted a senior U.S. source as saying that Canada and the United States had resolved their differences and reached an agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
The Washington Post, citing two informed sources, reported that the September 30 agreement between the United States and Canada would retain NAFTA as a tripartite trade agreement, and that the three heads of state would sign a new agreement within two months.
"Today, Canada, the United States, and Mexico have agreed new trade agreements -- the USMCA, which will provide our workers, farmers, and companies with high standards of trade agreements that will lead to freer markets, fairer deals, and more sustainable economic growth that will strengthen the middle class, create higher wages and create new opportunities for about 500 million people," the statement said.
It is understood that the current North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was signed by the United States, Mexico and Canada in 1994.
After Trump took office as president, he announced plans to revisit the agreement and sign a new one.
The three countries will begin this process of negotiations in 2017.
Jade Danny, who opposed the planned relocation of the US military base in Japan, was successfully elected in the early hours of 1 a.m. local time after an early election in Okinawa due to the illness of his former confidant, Wang Xiongzhi.
The vote was counted on September 30, with Yucheng gaining 39.662 million votes, the highest number in Okinawa county history, and more than 80,000 more votes than its main challenger, Ju Xin-chun.
A total of four candidates took part in the election, with a turnout of 63.24 percent, down 0.89 percentage points from the 2014 Okinawa County Enquirer election.
Yucheng said to the media that the results of the election showed that the county did not want to let Mr. Weng's efforts go to waste, and that he would continue to work with the governments of Japan and the United States on opposing plans for the relocation of the US military base and the closure of the base.
The US military base in Okinawa has long been criticized, with the Japanese government agreeing to relocate it to the border area of the famous city of Okinawa, but Okinawa residents are strongly opposed, hoping to move the base out of Okinawa altogether.
On the other hand, Yucheng said he had not initially taken a stand with the central government, and hoped that the two sides would have a full exchange of views, demonstrating their intention to reach a settlement through consultation.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also told the media on the morning of Jan. 1 that he would take the result seriously and would work on reviving Okinawa and reducing the burden on the base.
Japan's Chief Secretary Kan Yiwei said at a press conference on Monday that there had been no change in the government's policy on relocating the U.S. military base as soon as possible.
At the same time, he also expressed his desire to talk with Yucheng.
Yucheng will officially take up office in Okinawa County on the 4th of this month.
Since the mid-2000s, as demand for oilseeds has grown in China, Paul Thomas, a North Dakota farmer, has grown more and more soybeans in his fields.
The shift reached its highest point this year, when he planted 1,600 acres of soybeans in 5,000 acres of land on a scale never seen before.
But Thomas and many farmers like him plan to switch to staple crops in pre-American agricultural areas in 2019: Corn and wheat.
American farmers have grown more soybeans than corn this year for the first time in 35 years.
Other food crops are planned because of the plight of American farmers selling soybeans in the context of US President Donald Trump ’ s trade war against China.
China typically buys about 60% of U.S. soybeans, but the price of soybeans has fallen to a 10-year low in recent months as a result of a trade war that has seen almost zero purchases of American soybeans.
Thomas intends to grow more wheat next year, hoping to make more by reducing his dependence on crops that depend on China's demand.
Mr Thomas said the price of soybeans had "hit us hard."
Without Chinese purchases, he said, the spot price of soybeans near his farm was $7.10 per bushel, while the price necessary to cover the cost was $8.50.
Farmers in the United States have grown a record amount of soybeans this year, and the harvest is expected to be a record high.
At a time when they are vulnerable to shocks, they have been hit by a trade war.
In response to Trump's imposition of tariffs on imports of Chinese goods, China imposed import tariffs on imports of American soybeans in July.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture will release its first forecast of the area to be planted next year, which will include a consideration of the impact of tariffs.
It is expected that this estimate will confirm the expectations of the private sector for a reduction in soybean sown areas.
According to a report seen by Reuters, Informa Economics on October 19 expects corn cultivation to increase by 4% to 92.7 million acres (37.5 million hectares) in 2019, and soybean cultivation to decrease by 7% to 83 million acres.
Informa also expects a 4 percent increase in wheat acreage in the United States.
The area of soybeans grown before retaliatory tariffs was imposed rose to 89.6 million acres this year, about 15 million acres higher than a decade ago.
Corn acreage has increased by less than 5 million acres since 2008 to 89.1 million acres, and wheat cultivation this year was 47.8 million acres, near the lowest level in 100 years.
Aron Carlson, president of the Illinois Corn Growing Association, has a total acreage of 3,600 acres, and this year he is spending nearly half of his time growing soybeans, but plans to cut them in the future.
He said it is possible to increase corn cultivation by up to 20 percent at his farm in northern Illinois; the state is the largest soybean-growing state in the United States.
Soybeans produce less per acre than corn, but require less fertilizer, which makes them less expensive to grow overall.
If farmers move to end-value corn, it may raise costs, but it will benefit a number of businesses, including Andersons Inc. 'S fertilizer sellers.
Andersons CEO Pat Bowe told Reuters that he expects the conversion of corn to be beneficial for fertilizer use.
Bayer is also expected to benefit from farmers switching to corn.
The head of Bangkok's Langman Airport Authority, Sutirawa, apologized for the beating of a Chinese citizen at the airport and said Thailand would welcome Chinese tourists, and that authorities would step up their management, raise awareness of services and avoid similar incidents.
27 (UPI) -- A security guard at Langman Airport was involved in a physical confrontation with a Chinese man who had been refused entry to the airport, officials said.
Sutirava said that the security guards involved had acted in a serious manner, that the airport authority had suspended them and that a commission of inquiry had been set up to investigate the matter in accordance with the procedure, and that the security guard would be dismissed if the matter was proved to be true.
At present, the Thai Immigration Service has arranged for the man to return to China by air.
Sutirava apologized for the incident, saying that the Thai side attached great importance to the incident, was willing to do its utmost to reduce the impact of the incident on the tourists who had been beaten, and would send a letter of apology to the party through the Chinese Embassy in Thailand.
He said Langman Airport is ready to facilitate Chinese visitors to Thailand, and has joined the Thai Immigration Bureau in setting up special entry routes for Chinese tourists at Bangkok's five major international airports, including Suvarnabap, Langman, Chiang Mai, Phuket and Kaiai.
The next step, he said, would be for the Airport Authority to make changes to the landing sign area, express landing fee, and improve the quality of service and communication skills of staff.
When the Chinese Embassy in Thailand learned of the incident, it made contact with the person concerned for the first time to find out what had happened.
At the same time, representations were made to the heads of the Thai Immigration Bureau, the Airport Authority and the Ministry of Tourism and Sports, demanding that the Thai side thoroughly investigate the incident, severely punish the perpetrators, and will continue to maintain close communication with the Thai side, properly handle the matter and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the parties concerned.
Xinhua International Times Review: Defending Multilateralism, China's Convergence and Convergence.
At a time when unilateralism is surging against the current tide, international rules and the multilateral order are being buffeted.
To some extent, the confrontation between unilateralism and multilateralism has entered a critical period.
As a responsible power, China, with its broad-based vision and solid and vigorous actions, is working with the international community to safeguard multilateralism and push it forward.
In the face of new challenges in the new situation, China has given a loud voice to the direction and path of multilateralism.
As the State Councilor and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Wang Yi, said in his address to the general debate of the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, multilateralism in the new era should adhere to the goal of co-operation and win-win, based on rules and order, with equity and justice as the main thrust, and be guided by effective action.
At the same time, China calls for the establishment of a global pattern of development cooperation, with the United Nations at its core, North-South cooperation as the main channel and South-South cooperation as the complement, and for all parties to work together to build a community of human destiny.
China's thinking and voice reflect the mainstream voice of the international community.
As Espinosa, the President of the 73rd session of the General Assembly, has said, under the current circumstances, "the United Nations needs more than ever to promote multilateralism and uphold a rules-based international system".
IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said the international community should continue to firmly uphold the multilateral trading system, adhere to the rules of international trade and resolve differences through consultation.
In recent years, with the adjustment of global economic and political power, a number of emerging markets and groups of developing countries have emerged to play a greater role in the major international multilateral mechanisms, providing a new impetus for the development of multilateralism in the face of headwinds.
Taking this dimension into account, the idea of multilateralism, such as building a large family rather than piecing together small circles, and sticking to the idea of co-ownership rather than winning, is an inevitable choice to meet global challenges and solve world problems, and represents the common aspiration of most countries in the world.
There are advanced ideas, more solid actions.
The "Belt and Road" initiative put forward by China has become the largest platform for international cooperation.
China has launched international and regional cooperation initiatives such as the "Belt and Road", the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the "16 + 1 Cooperation" to promote international regional cooperation, improve and complement the existing international system and order, bring innovation and vitality to multilateral cooperation, and contribute to promoting the development of the international order in a more just and rational direction.
As a defender of the international order and a practitioner of multilateralism, China has become more and more active in the multilateral arena of the United Nations.
Good offices in international hot spots, addressing climate change, participating in peacekeeping operations, working hard to reduce poverty, and helping other countries to implement the 2030 sustainable development agenda.
As UN Secretary-General Guterres has said, China has become an important pillar of multilateralism.
As the world ’ s “trust deficit ” intensifies, and as populist and polarizing trends rise, it is at a time when the world ’ s need for multilateral cooperation is most pressing.
At this historic juncture, the international community needs to join hands to translate consensus into action, resolutely defend multilateralism and work together to build a community of human destiny.

Let us build on the strength of the spirit of Inverness and advance towards the great goal!

Fifth "Handicap Voice Month" Coming to Focus on Sexual Education of Disabled Young People - China New Network
In recent years, the topic of sex education for young people in China has been widely discussed, but the challenge of sex education for young people with disabilities is still very difficult.
Recently, a seminar on the challenges and practical strategies of comprehensive sexuality education for persons with disabilities was held in Beijing.
How to educate disabled children and young people about sex has become an important topic in this seminar.
The Report on Sex-Related Knowledge, Attitudes and Behaviour of Disabled Children and Young People in China, released at the conference, showed that the proportion of children with disabilities subjected to sexual harassment and abuse was higher than that of healthy children.
For disabled children and adolescents, more attention is paid to "sexual protection" in society.
The purpose of this seminar is to promote comprehensive sexuality education for disabled children and adolescents in China in terms of family support, school education and institutional services, and to provide support to disabled children and adolescents at their source so that they, like others, have the right to enjoy their own love.
Experts believe that, all along, the public's awareness of the disabled groups in China has remained at a level that is not deep enough.
Under the influence of traditional attitudes and other factors, comprehensive sexuality education for persons with disabilities, especially children and adolescents with disabilities, is not sufficiently advanced in China.
However, in recent years, with the support of UNESCO and the public welfare, the practice and path of sexual and reproductive health education for the disabled in China has been developed in an all-round way.
The Report shows that children and young people with visual, hearing, intellectual and physical impairments, while having more difficulty in gaining access to sexual knowledge and understanding of intimate relationships than the general population, have generally developed in a more accessible and enriching manner.
The "Seminar on Comprehensive Sexual Education Challenges and Practical Strategies for Persons with Disabilities", sponsored by the Shanghai People's Public Interest Foundation, supported by the UNESCO Representative Office in China, the International Alliance for Disabled Persons (France) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) Representative Office in China, aims to discuss the comprehensive development of sexual and reproductive health education practices for persons with disabilities throughout the whole cycle in the context of China, to promote the development of comprehensive education strategies for young people in the field of education, to promote the development of special education and to promote the development of comprehensive education for children and to develop a comprehensive education for young people's interests in the future, and to develop a comprehensive education strategies for children, and to develop a comprehensive education for the development of education for children in the development of education for children, and to develop a broad-oriented to develop a comprehensive education of education for the development of education for the development of education for children in the education for children, and to develop a comprehensive-oriented to the education for the education for the education of the education of the education of the education of the education of the education of the education of the education of the education of the education of the education of the education of the education of the education of the education of the education of the education of the education of the education of children in the education of children in the education of children in the education of children in the education of the education of the education of the education of the education of the education of the education of the education of the education of the education of the education of the education of the education of the education of the education of the education of the education of the education of the disabled of the disabled of the disabled, and to the disabled of the education of children, the disabled, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the youth of the youth of the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the people, the
Beijing, September 30 (Xinhua) -- China's central bank on Sunday released net scheduled short-term outflows of foreign currency assets, showing that the central bank's short positions in foreign currencies against local currency forward and futures contracts were zero for 12 consecutive months at the end of August, and there were still no long positions in the month.
The central bank said it held short positions of $60.44 billion in foreign currency against local currency forward and futures contracts at the end of August for the fourth straight month, while short positions valued at SDR (Special Drawing Rights) stood at $42.76 billion.
Since then, the central bank's foreign exchange forward short position has been zero.
The central bank first released the data at the end of March 2016; the data showed the central bank's foreign currency position against local currency forward and futures contracts at the end of February 2016 was $24.38 billion with short positions of $28.9 billion.
The September data, released at the end of October of the same year, showed a net increase of $164.01 billion to $453.01 billion for the first time.
The central bank has previously said that the short forward and futures positions of foreign currencies mainly reflect the long-term foreign exchange operations of the central bank with commercial banks to meet the hedging needs of enterprises' foreign currency liabilities, and that it will continue to provide long-term risk-averse products on a real-world basis, with a smaller impact on the future size of foreign exchange reserves.
On the evening of September 20 this year, on the K158 train, Joe, a third-grader in Zhengzhou, went to the crane wall by car.
A master on the train bought a seat-free ticket, but took her seat: "Take a pat."
Two hours' drive away, the conductor advised him that an hour was still invalid.
In the end, a male passenger in the same car couldn't look down to pull the master up.
According to public opinion, although the end result is mostly that the hegemon is condemned by the public, subjected to administrative punishment by the public security department, or even placed on the integrity blacklist, the public still feels that it is not "disgruntled": Why can't the bully be punished on the spot?
Why not stop their unethical or even illegal behavior on the spot, but punish it after the fact?
And how is it that a male passenger is "bumpy" and dragged up by the unreasonable behavior of the "master bully"?
The main reason for this is that only long-distance trains are equipped with police officers, and short-haul trains are generally absent; even when there is a police officer, they tend to worry about the possible rogue response of the bully rather than taking coercive measures to remove them.
Repeated incidents of bullying make people realize that it is necessary for the bully to be forcibly removed or even punished on the spot in order to act as a deterrent.
This requires our train crew to dare to take strong measures in a timely manner, and the train without the police should be deployed as soon as possible to protect the timely stop and fight against illegal acts.
On October 1, the first day of the National Day holiday, traffic soared from Beichuan Qiang Autonomous County in Sichuan Province to Songpan in Maoming County.
At about 1300 hours, the Beichuan Transit Police received a call for help, stating that his family had been involved in a traffic accident in Songpan and that due to the limited medical conditions in the area, they were in urgent need of medical treatment in Mianyang.
The one-way traffic control is carried out at Tangjiashan Ring Lake Road in Beichuan. We would like to ask the traffic police to release the 120 emergency vehicles.
Upon receiving the call for help, the police officer on duty promptly reported the situation to the brigade, and the captain, Mr. Huang Xuemin, was briefed on the situation, and immediately arranged for the police officer on duty to contact the caller, demanding that the escort work be fully done.
"More than a thousand vehicles entered the control section at that time, and after contacting the 120 emergency vehicles, it is expected that the time of arrival in Beichuan will be around 15: 00, and we will make arrangements for deployment immediately," the spokesman said.
In order to prevent vehicles that have entered this section of the road from running in parallel with each other, emergency vehicles need to be circumvented from the Tangjiashan Yan Lake Ring Road and the road is steep and narrow. In order to prevent vehicles that have already entered this section of the road, traffic officers are required to take control of the vehicle at the beginning, middle and end of the road for a period of one hour, and remind all passing drivers to leave the road for the vehicle to be staggered.
Later, the squadron police also temporarily stopped vehicles from entering the control section, queuing for the 120 emergency vehicles that were about to arrive.
At 1500 hours, a Chuan U-plate ambulance entered the territory of Beichuan, and the Beichuan Transit Police dispatched a police vehicle to open the road and escort the first aid vehicle into the controlled section of the road retrograde.
It is understood that only one vehicle is allowed to pass through some parts of the Ring Lake Road and that the civilian police have placed temporary control over these areas in advance, ensuring the smooth passage of 120 emergency vehicles.
The traffic police contacted the two village committees in advance to take a detour of the village road and to prevent the social vehicles from entering the village.
"It took only 40 minutes to get 120 emergency vehicles from Beichuan Transit Police to the normal road to the 302 provincial road," he said.
'according to normal conditions, it takes four hours for the entire passage to take place, 'he said.
"This arrangement has been successful in securing valuable treatment time for the patient," he said.
It is reported that at 1720 hours, the critically ill patients were sent to Mianyang in time for treatment.

Communications and electricity continue to be disrupted.
Nugroho said the missing included five foreigners, three of whom were French, a Korean and a Malaysian.
The earthquake and tsunami killed 832 people.
Indonesian Vice President Kala said the death toll was likely to rise to several thousand.
Earlier, Indonesian President Joko Widodo had surveyed the affected areas and called on the population to endure.
London, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab has privately demanded Britain's right to leave the Irish border "secure" arrangements after three months, the Daily Telegraph reported on Sunday.
Raab made the request to Simon Coveney, Ireland's deputy prime minister and foreign affairs minister, at a private meeting in London last Tuesday, the report said.
The report said the request was "clearly at odds" with a three-day visit to Dublin by David Lidington, the chancellor of the British Cabinet Office.
The Department for Brexit Affairs said it would not comment on private meetings.
At 8: 05 a.m. yesterday, two suspected shoplifters were caught in a shoplifting spree at the 20-bus Yongding Gate station to the Zhuang Market station.
Two pickpocketing men cut the passenger's coat pocket, stole 800 yuan of the cash, and let the policeman, who had already been crouched nearby, get hold of it.
It was the first case of shoplifting uncovered by police in Beijing during the National Day.
Yesterday morning, more than 5 o'clock, the Beijing public security mobile investigation team anti-rip investigators arrived at the scheduled location.
According to past experience, areas with concentrated population flows, public transport hubs and subway lines, including Tiananmen Square, are the focus of their work among the people who watch the flag.
In the flow of people, plain-clothed police officers calmly watched the passing crowd.
At more than 7 o'clock in the morning, investigators crouching at the bus stop found two suspicious men with a male passenger on the 20 bus from Yongding Gate.
In the car, two suspicious men, one left and one right, sandwiched the male passenger in the middle, one of whom tried to give cover to the other.
They did not know, however, that their every move had fallen into the eyes of civilian policemen in plain clothes, who were watching.
In the process of waiting for the man to steal, the policeman stared intently at the man who was preparing the shoplifting, and was caught by the detective after they had picked up the thief.
A reporter for the Beijing Morning News saw that police had seized 800 yuan in cash from the theft suspect.
"The money was taken from the passenger's pocket of clothing."
Pointing to a broken coat pocket, the policeman said, "They cut it off and stole 800 yuan from a traveler who came to Beijing, and when we caught them, the money was just loaded into their own pocket."
The reporter learned that, in order to catch the two men, the civilian police in plain clothes had been following them for an hour, and had finally caught them in the act of committing the crime.
The two suspects are currently under police review.
Civilian police in plain clothes told reporters that the question of who was suspicious in the crowd was a simple one for the civilian police.
"When the thieves catch more, they will find that their eyes, manner, and ordinary passengers are different. Apart from staring at people's pockets and backpacks, they also like to drill into the crowd rather than hide from them."
The police also told reporters that the suspect and other cars often have no purpose, like to roam the station, find the object of the pickpocketing before trailing on the bus.
"These are lessons learned, and it is natural to know that plain clothes have been dry for a long time," he said.
In addition, the civilian police also suggested that "the outer pockets are the most convenient and the most vulnerable to theft."
Take care of your belongings during the ride, so as not to steal them.

As of 1700 hours, traffic on highways and provincial roads in all parts of the country remained smooth and orderly, with no one death or more than five road accidents reported, and no more than three fatalities reported in 29 provinces and municipalities.
During the morning rush hour, traffic flows on roads and highways around major cities rose sharply, and local sections, as well as toll stations, service areas, bridges, tunnels, interconnections and other nodes, experienced slow queues of vehicles to varying degrees due to excessive traffic flows, road bottlenecks and scraping accidents, especially in Beijing and Tianjin, the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta and the Chongqing area, and the road traffic flow was gradually restored in the afternoon.
It is known that on the first day of the holiday, the traffic police throughout the country began to carry out security work during the holiday period, devoting more than 190,000 police officers and more than 70,000 police vehicles to strictly patrol and control, strictly control traffic control, timely traffic diversion, quick handling of accidents, extensive publicity and guidance, and a number of measures to ensure the safety of the roads on the first day of the holiday.
It is expected that some of the traffic flows in and out of the city expressway and the provincial and provincial highways will continue to run at a high level on February 2, while the traffic flow in tourist scenic areas will increase markedly, and traffic congestion and safety risks will increase.
British Prime Minister Theresa May on Sunday called on her party to unite behind her Brexit plan, directly calling on critics to back it, saying the free trade deal they want is at the heart of her Brexit plan.
On September 30, 2018, in Birmingham, England, British Prime Minister Theresa May travelled to attend the Conservative Party conference.
Theresa May's plans have again come under fire from two former cabinet ministers, including former Foreign Secretary Johnson, who called Theresa May's plans "deranged" at the start of the Tory party's raucous annual conference.
But she also received strong support from other ministers who backed Brexit, who "praised Theresa May as one of the most polite people," with International Trade Secretary Lord Fox and Foreign Secretary Hunt also pointing their anger at the EU.
Theresa May's already fragile leadership has come under further pressure this month as the European Union rejected parts of the so-called "Chicks" plan.
But Theresa May took a positive view of the consultations, saying she was prepared to consider the EU's misgivings.
"My message to my own party is, let's work together to find the best deal for Britain," said Theresa May.
Johnson, the former British foreign secretary, called Theresa May's plans "deranged" and attacked her for having no faith in Brexit.
He and former Brexit Secretary David Davis are pushing for a Canadian-style self-trade deal with the EU.
Theresa May said the proposal would allow Northern Ireland to implement different tariff rules in the same way as Northern Ireland was split from the UK.

In recent years, there have been many incidents in which the campus plastic runway did not meet the standards.
To this end, the Ministry of Education has issued a circular requiring the implementation of the new national standard on the surface playing fields of synthetic materials for primary and secondary schools to be delivered for use after 1 November this year.
The compulsory national standard, "Synthetic Material Surface Sports Ground for Primary and Secondary Schools", which was led by the Ministry of Education and drafted by 26 scientific research institutes and testing institutions, was revised over two years, during which more than 100 expert meetings were organized, as well as field visits and sample tests throughout the country, and hundreds of experiments were collected to verify the products of enterprises on the market.
In contrast to the 2005 old national standard, the reporter found that the new national standard not only changed from a "national recommended standard" to a "national mandatory standard", but also added a number of contents, including thickness requirements, physical properties, anti-aging properties, inorganic filler content requirements, anti-skid gelatin high polymer content requirements, limit of harmful substances for finished products, non-solid and solid raw materials, etc.
In particular, the new national standard limits the number of hazardous substances that may be produced in the construction of plastic runways on campus, from 7 to 18, and regulates the limits of volatile organic matter in the completed runways in accordance with home loading standards.
If the release of hazardous substances is specified in the "limits and odour requirements for hazardous substances in the finished products of the cast and prefabricated layers", the total volatile organic compounds are required to be no higher than 5 mg / m3, formaldehyde to be no higher than 0.4 mg / m3, carbon disulfide to be no higher than 7 mg / m3, benzene to be no higher than 0.1 mg / m3, and odour odour level to be no higher than 3.
The new national standard also makes detailed provisions on the sampling requirements, inspection rules and judgment rules of plastic runways in primary and secondary schools.
In addition, for the first time, the artificial lawn on campus has been included in the compulsory testing scope of the national standard.
In the near future, special work will be carried out on the implementation of the new national standard, and the implementation of the new national standard will be submitted to the Department of Physical Health and Arts Education of the Ministry of Education during the year.

To activate rural consumption, it is necessary to purify the market by means of normalized mechanism, guide the demand for healthy consumption, and improve the sense of acquisition in the consumption of farmers.
The data showed that the potential for rural consumption continued to unlock, with retail sales of rural consumer goods rising by 10.5 per cent in the first half of this year, a 1.3 percentage point increase over towns and cities.
On a visit to a poor village in a western county, the village has only one convenience store, entering the shop, some goods like to know, "goldfish" as "Golden Dragon Oil," "Wondy" became "Wonyu", "Shanzhai" merchandise.
Over the years, similar phenomena have frequently been exposed, some rural fake goods are close to the brand name, the packaging is similar, the false truth, it is too much to guard against.
A consumer survey released by a city in the west shows that the problem of ultra-fake goods in rural areas is serious, with 66 per cent of users buying fake goods in sub-township supermarkets, with food accounting for more than half of the total.
The departments concerned to improve the rural market, year after year called to fight, why "Li Ghost" is still playing repeatedly?
Unlike urban markets, farmers have a relatively weak sense of human rights protection, coupled with many remote rural locations and blind areas beyond the reach of regulatory powers, allowing the breeding ground for fake and inferior commodities.
A commodity multi-head, some sector control price, some management production, some management market, functions cross-cutting, annual holiday, centralized management of the wind, false goods to avoid the wind, and slowly emerged, just after the old holiday, new leave came out.
The lack of a long-term regulatory mechanism, the difficulty of purifying the rural market, the low cost of law-breaking and the high interests of some illegal traders have led to the "up-and-down countryside" of some illegal traders, and some rural areas have become "waste markets".
From the food and clothing to the well-off, the masses of farmers are moving towards development-oriented consumption.
Recently, the Central Committee of the Party and the State Council issued "Some Opinions on Improving the Mechanism to Promote the Consumption System to Further Stimulate the Consumption Potential of Residents", which put forward the aim of promoting the upgrading of the consumption ladder of rural residents, with the aim of enabling the masses of farmers to "consume" and "dare to consume" so that rural consumption can really flourish.
On the one hand, it is necessary to deepen reform, eliminate malpractices in market supervision and management, adapt the situation to local conditions, improve food safety and product quality supervision networks, and continuously reduce the space for making and selling fake goods in rural areas.
On the other hand, it is necessary to strengthen law enforcement and control the "capillaries", so as not to allow fake and inferior practices to spread in rural areas.
The strict punishment of pit farmers is the protection of farmers, no matter how hidden the counterfeiters are, should not be the reason for the breeding of fake commodities, the relevant departments should clarify their responsibilities, the basic supervision force should sink, which link is the problem, must be held accountable, let the counterfeiters and sellers have no place to hide.
We will strictly restrict market access, strictly examine the qualifications of producers and operators, keep the market in circulation, let the products come and go in the right direction and clear the way, and find ways from the source and root to keep legitimate dealers at ease and farmers at ease with their purchases.
To activate rural consumption, it is necessary to guide the demand for healthy consumption.
Along with the upgrading of consumption, many farmers seek not only to eat enough and eat well, but also to live a high-quality life, such as culture and health, and not to use the rural market as "cheap" or "low-quality" paintings.
It is necessary to promote the extension of e-commerce coverage to rural areas, the opening of two-way distribution channels between urban and rural areas, and the integration of offline industrial development platforms and on-line electronic trading platforms to support the expansion of new patterns of consumption into rural markets; to promote the organic integration of trade and logistics with leisure agriculture, rural tourism and product processing in towns and villages; and to improve the system of modern rural circulation networks, optimizing the integration of resources and effectively reducing the cost of circulation in rural areas.
It is necessary to create a clear and secure market environment in the countryside, so that farmers can consume more and more, so as to improve their sense of achievement and happiness.
From November 1, China will reduce the most-favoured-nation tariff rate on some commodities, and the total tariff level will be reduced to 7.5%
In accordance with the decision of the 26th executive meeting of the State Council, the State Council Tariff Commission issued a notice on 30 November 2018 to reduce the most-favoured-nation (MFN) tax rate for some commodities from 1 November 2018.
According to the "Notice of the State Council Tariff Commission on the Reduction of Import Tariffs on Certain Commodities", the most-favoured-nation tax rate for some industrial goods and other goods will be lowered from November 1 this year in order to meet the needs of upgrading industries, reducing enterprise costs and meeting the multi-level consumption of the masses.
A total of 1,585 tax items, or about 19 per cent of our total tax lines, were taxed, with the average tax rate falling from 10.5 per cent to 7.8 per cent, with an average reduction of 26 per cent.
The tax is mainly on textiles; stone, ceramics, glass products; some steel and base metal products; mechanical and electrical equipment and parts, such as metalworking machinery, textile machinery, engineering machinery, transmission equipment, electrical equipment, instrumentation, etc.; and resource commodities and primary products, such as non-metallic mines, inorganic chemicals, wood and paper products, jade and so on.
At the same time, with the reduction of the total tariff level, especially the import duty on pharmaceuticals and daily consumer goods, the tariff rate of import duty on imported goods has been lowered accordingly.
In order to carry out the decision-making and deployment of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, China has imposed zero tariffs on the vast majority of imported drugs since May 1 this year, reduced import duties on automobiles, parts and components, and some consumer goods for daily use since July 1, and implemented the third step of tax reduction on products expanded by the information technology agreement.
The State Council's Committee on Tariffs and Tariffs has learned that this year, after successive autonomous adjustments, China's total tariff level will fall from 9.8% in the previous year to 7.5%, with an average reduction of 23%.
The appropriate reduction of tariffs is conducive to the balanced development of foreign trade, the promotion of a higher level of opening to the outside world, and the overall use of both domestic and international resources to promote domestic supply-side structural reforms.
The head of the committee said that this year marks the 40th anniversary of reform and opening-up, and that the initiative to reduce the overall level of tariffs is a practical action to implement the spirit of Secretary-General Xi Jinping's important speech at the Boao Forum for Asia, as well as an important initiative to further expand China's opening-up and import in line with its own high-quality development needs, which shows that China will unswervingly pursue a win-win opening strategy and, while enhancing its own development drive, and making China better benefit.
On September 29, the regional public brand launch of "Ring Township" agricultural products in Ring County, Gansu Province, was held in Nankai District, Tianjin City.
The Red Army Little Rice, Black Peas, Mountain Boy Pastoral Black Goat, Hardy Button Tea, Paper Splash Book, Pure Handmade slippers... One piece of beautifully packaged agricultural products neatly placed on the stand, they have a common brand name called "Ring Township."
"To build a regional brand of 'Ring Township', which effectively solves the bottleneck of development of" many scattered, small and weak "agricultural products in the surrounding county, has become a powerful vehicle for the fight against poverty." 29, Gansu Ring County hosted the "Ring Township" regional public brand launch in the Nankai district of Tianjin City.
Ring County is located at the border of the three provinces of Shaanxi Gangning, and has a long history and abundant resources as the "township of China's small and mixed grain", "the country's leading grain production county.
Lamb meat, yellow rice wine, buckwheat chopped noodles, soft oat noodles and other local snacks in the countryside are often reminiscent of the taste.
With the increasing level of urbanization in China and the rapid increase of the urban population, a large number of young people from rural areas have left their hometown to start urban life.
"Now that urban life is fast and stressful, more and more people are beginning to miss the country life when they were young," said Yang Qiajia, an expert on agricultural brands in China. "But the most beautiful memory is the countryside." The brand design of the "rural people" is named after the country and the homesickness of the people who live in the surrounding counties.
The climate of the surrounding county is special, the sunshine time is long, the temperature difference is large day and night, the characteristics of the small grain planting conditions are unique.
China is home to more than 20 kinds of small and miscellaneous grain, with the highest yield in Gansu Province and the highest quality in the country.
Wang Xiaoli, a girl from the city of Tianjin who attended the conference as a volunteer, said, "The hometown people are the most friendly, the hometown tastes the most beautiful," the "around the country people" brand has aroused too many of our homesickness, recollection, not to forget, the food there, hope that the "around the country people" brand will go further and do more. "
Dr Tan Bin, a researcher at the Scientific Research Institute of the National Food and Material Reserve, said that by examining more than 900 sets of index data, the testing data of buckwheat, buckwheat, black beans and other agricultural products in Ring County had a strong advantage, with many of the physiological substances in the mixed grains higher than the standard data, and the "people in the surrounding countryside" had an inherent advantage in capturing the high-end grain market in China.
The release of the "Ring Township" brand will further enhance the quality, standardization and scale of quality agricultural products in the surrounding counties, thus helping to create a good overall image of agricultural products in the surrounding counties and rapidly raise their visibility, competitiveness and added value, said Chai Chunying, secretary of the county committee.
Canada's gross domestic product rose 0.2 per cent in July from a month earlier, a higher-than-expected increase, heating up market expectations that the Bank of Canada will raise interest rates next month.
If it does, it would be the fifth rate hike by the central bank in a little more than a year.
Analysts interviewed by Reuters had previously forecast growth of 0.1 per cent.
Statistics Canada said on Friday that 12 out of 20 industries had achieved growth.
The data is notable because the central bank predicted earlier this month that temporary factors could drag down third-quarter GDP data.
Bank of Canada President Paul Poloz on Thursday pledged that the central bank will continue to raise interest rates gradually and will keep a close eye on economic data.
The next time the Bank of Canada announces a decision on interest rates will be on October 24.
The Bank of Canada has raised interest rates four times since July 2017, thanks to a stronger Canadian economy and a near-record low unemployment rate.
Stephen Brown, a senior Canadian economist at Kaepernick, says the economy is on track to grow at an annual rate of about 2% in the third quarter.
"This would be higher than the 1.5 per cent expected by the Bank of Canada and would therefore be another reason to expect the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates next month," he said in a report.
The overnight index swap showed that the market's estimate of the probability of a rate hike by the Bank of Canada in October rose from 76.46 per cent to 78.27 per cent.
The first joint inspection of the Han River into the sea in 65 years by the Han Dynasty
South Korea's Defense Ministry confirmed on Friday that the two Koreas launched a joint expedition into the waters of the Hanjiang and Linjin rivers into the sea.
The initiative is a prelude to guaranteeing the free navigation of civilian vessels on both sides.
The briefing, provided to the media on the same day by South Korea's Defense Ministry, showed that it was the first joint visit by the two sides to the Hanjiang River into the sea since the Korean War armistice agreement was signed in 1953.
In September this year, the two Koreas signed a military agreement to conduct a joint inspection of the waters, including the Hanjiang River into the sea, starting in November, in order to safeguard future environmental protection and develop tourism.
In October, the two Koreas planned a joint inspection of the waters during a military-level meeting.
On November 5, a joint Korean-Korean water expedition was officially launched.
The joint mission consisted of 20 members, including the Korean and Korean militaries, experts and others.
According to South Korea's Defense Ministry, neither of the two sides carried weapons and banned the use of words and deeds that irritated the other.
"Because there is no military demarcation line near the mouth of the sea, the area was once an area of high accident, but through joint visits it will become a new peace zone in the future," he said.
The waters visited jointly by the two Koreas have a total length of about 70 km and a total area of about 280 sq km.
South Korea's defense ministry said it will send six research vessels to explore the depth of the sea to provide basic information for safe navigation in the waters, and will provide navigation maps for civilian ships to and from the waters when the investigation is complete.
The two Koreas held summit talks in Pyongyang in October 2007 to reach an agreement on the joint use of the Han and Linjin rivers to enter the sea, but the follow-up talks have run aground because of tensions on the peninsula.
Under a military agreement signed by the two Koreas in September, future ships from both sides will need to inform each other in advance before sailing in common waters.
Beijing, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese citizens Guo Yuqin and Mao Run Xin lost their ties during a visit to Mongolia recently, according to the website of the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia.
It is understood that the two were members of the Blue Sky Rescue Team. On October 19, they contacted relatives and relatives in the country and said they were going to explore the mountains near Kuzukor Lake and shared their location via micromail. They have since lost contact and are suspected to have gone to no-man's land.
The Chinese Embassy in Mongolia has always attached great importance to the protection of the legitimate rights and interests and security of Chinese citizens in Mongolia, and has attached great importance to consular protection and assistance.
Upon receiving the news of the loss of the two tourists, the Embassy immediately launched the emergency plan, and tried to seize the golden rescue time and fully carry out its work.
The Embassy maintained close communication with the family of the person concerned, assisted the family to report the case to the police immediately and provided the family with a list of interpreters to choose from.
The Embassy met with the heads of the Mongolian Ministry of External Relations, the General Police and the General Directorate of Emergency Situations for the first time, briefed them on the situation, requested the Mongolian side to carry out search and rescue as soon as possible, and maintained close communication with the Mongolian side throughout the search and rescue process so as to ensure timely and up-to-date progress.
At the same time, the Embassy provided assistance to family members in issuing information on the search of persons in Mongolia, and extensively initiated active participation in the search of persons in Mongolian overseas Chinese and Chinese-owned enterprises, providing effective clues and providing assistance to a number of Blue Sky Rescue Team members who went to Mongolia to assist in the rescue.
With a strong push from the embassy, Montaigne sent rescue teams in the first place and promised to waive the search-and-rescue costs.
The General Directorate of the Mongolian Police and the General Directorate of Emergencies instructed the police and the emergency department of the province of Kuzukor to make every effort to search and rescue the area.
Owing to the remote location of Kuzugul Lake at the border of northern Mongolia with Russia, its extensive population and extremely difficult transportation and communications, and the fact that Mongolia is now in a harsh winter with temperatures as low as 20 degrees below zero, the local police and emergency departments have overcome enormous difficulties by mobilizing almost all the police and mobilizing local herders to conduct extensive day-to-day search and rescue operations, including by horseback riding, walking and visiting herdsmen.
At the same time, in view of the special situation of the pastoral area, Mongfang has been through the broadcast cycle for many days to publish people-seeking information.
Domestic Blue Sky Rescue Team staff have also come with the Mongolian side to take an active part in the rescue.
The safety of the two disenfranchisees has always touched our hearts.
After more than 10 days of disassociation, the Embassy has received a number of leads, but it has yet to find two, and the search and rescue operation is still under way.
In keeping with the principle of "putting people first", the Embassy will continue to pay close attention to the matter, push the Mongolian side to continue to make every effort to search and rescue, and provide maximum assistance to the families of the persons concerned.
The Embassy calls on our compatriots and enterprises in Mongolia to contact the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia for the first time if they are aware of any relevant information.
