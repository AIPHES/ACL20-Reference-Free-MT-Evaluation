According to British media, US Deputy Admiral William Moran said that even if the US Navy is reinvigorating to cope with the increasingly worrying Russia on both sides of the Atlantic, the United States continues to take the Asia-Pacific region to the Pentagon. The scope has expanded to include the Indian Ocean - Asia - Pacific - as the focus of the navy.
According to the British "Jane's Defense Weekly" website reported on September 24, the United States listed China and Russia as strategic competitors in the new national defense strategy announced at the beginning of the year.
Since then, the US Navy has reinstated the Second Fleet to more directly confront Russian activities.
The report said that these actions raised some doubts and concerns among allies and analysts, who feared that the US Navy might be far from the "Asia-Pacific rebalancing" strategy that marked the Obama administration.
But Admiral Moran said that the focus of the US Navy is still on the Western Pacific.
On January 24, 2018, at the roundtable discussion hosted by the National Bureau of Asian Studies in Washington called “Challenging the High Seas Challenge,” he said: “For us, there have been no major changes.”
Moran said: "The focus remains on rebalancing, shifting focus or whatever you want to describe it."
However, he acknowledged that the United States has close ties with Europe.
He said: "We will continue to focus on the growth of the West Coast and balance what we can do."
Although Moran pointed out that the overall policy on Russia belongs to the US Secretary of Defense's terms of reference, he warned: "Russians may face demographic and economic challenges, but history has shown that if we clash with them, they will be very tough. ”
Admiral Moran said that as part of the US resurgence of Russia, China and other competitors, the US Navy is dynamically deploying troops into a "new combat model" that will help opponents fight against US aircraft carriers. Groups or other assets will be deployed unprepared at any given time and place.
He said: "Our Navy and Marine Corps support it - the concept of unpredictable warfare, not appearing in the same place again and again, almost like a clockwork -- this is our approach."
According to the report, the first attempt to adopt this new approach was the “Harry Truman” aircraft carrier battle group. Early deployment of the battle group included working visits to the port and patrolling in areas that were usually only adopted.
Moran said that the US Navy is currently working to ensure that allies know that these warships will still patrol the traditional areas and are still addressing logistics and family liaison issues for the new deployment process.
The Royal Australian Navy Commander, Lieutenant General Michael Noonan, also spoke at the event, saying that the Australian army can work seamlessly with the US aircraft carrier battle group.
He said that this situation will continue as the Royal Australian Navy plans to purchase another nine frigates equipped with the Aegis combat system.

Japan’s ITOCHU Corporation, on Friday, recognized US$1.3 billion in impairment losses on its investment in China’s CITIC shares, which was written down against the biggest corporate investment deal due to trade tensions between China and the United States.
In May 2016, a man from Tokyo, Japan, walked through the headquarters of Marubeni Corporation.
Marubeni said that the trade war has hit its US grain division, Gao Hong, which has suspended financial transactions in agriculture.
Some Japanese heavy equipment manufacturers and telecommunications companies have already issued warnings about the impact of Sino-US trade frictions when they announced their latest achievements. Now these Japanese trading companies have joined the ranks.
The United States and China have imposed tariffs on each other’s hundreds of billions of dollars of goods. US President Trump threatened to extend the taxation to more than $500 billion in Chinese exports to the United States if the dispute could not be resolved.
Tsuyoshi Hachimura, chief financial officer of ITOCHU, said that the impact of trade disputes on the Chinese economy next year may be even greater.
ITOCHU Corporation and the Thai CP Group invested US$10 billion in CITIC in 2015 to acquire a 20% stake.
Hachimura said that ITOCHU Corporation has raised a total of 143.3 billion yen ($1.3 billion) in this shareholding because it believes that CITIC's share price will not pick up in the near future.
ITOCHU Corporation maintains a profit forecast of 500 billion yen for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019.
China added a 25% import tariff on US soybeans in July to counteract Washington’s trade frictions.
“Our grain business has been hit by US-China trade friction,” said Maruhong’s finance chief Yasaka Yanhiro.
He said that Gao Hong has stopped financial transactions in his account since September.
Gao Hong spokesperson Pat Burke said in a statement on Friday that the company’s move was “in accordance with internal policy restrictions and lack of market opportunities.”
He also said that the suspension of financial transactions will not lead to a reduction in jobs.

People's Daily Online, Beijing, November 5 (Wang Xiaoyan) Under the current wave of “mass entrepreneurship, innovation”, more and more technology companies have begun to pay attention to patent R&D and related protection work, and tap the potential value of patents to occupy the market. Dominance.
Similarly, many technology companies have encountered numerous infringements in patent technology licensing and patent technology use.
At the end of 2017, Tan Wei, He Zhanghong and Lai Bin from Guangdong Province, on the grounds of patent infringement, will be the developer of “Drip Trip” APP Beijing Xiaoju Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Xiaoju Technology), the operator Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Didi Chuxing), the seller Guangdong Pacific Internet Information Services Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Guangdong Pacific) v. to the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The three plaintiffs requested the court to order, and the three defendants immediately stopped manufacturing, selling, promising sales, and using the plaintiff’s patent act.
On October 30, 2018, the China Judgment Document Network published the “Civil Judgment of First-instance of Infringement of Invention Patent Rights between Tan Wei and He Zhanghong and Beijing Xiaoju Technology Co., Ltd.”, which disclosed the part of the patent infringement of the APP. Case details.
The three plaintiffs believed that the patentee and inventor of the patent based on the mobile terminal-based carpooling service system and method, and the whole operation process of the “shunting” application in the “Drip” app corresponded to the technical solution of patent protection involved. Patent infringement.
However, during the court's ruling, Xiao Orange Technology believed that Guangdong Pacific was not a suitable defendant. It only provided free downloads of the APP “Drip Trip” on the Internet, and did not implement the patent method involved. There was no direct or indirect infringement. The act should not be listed as the defendant in this case.
Secondly, the infringement of this case is not in Guangdong.

Based on the deficiencies, the defendant Xiaoju Technology Co., Ltd. dismissed the objection to the jurisdiction of the case and accepted the acceptance fee for the jurisdiction.
At present, the other trials of the case have not been announced, and the reporter will pay close attention to the follow-up details of the patent infringement case of Didi Travel.
Interview with CEO of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization of Australia: Australia-China Science and Technology Cooperation Results
“China’s science and technology have developed rapidly in the past few decades, and Australia and China can achieve fruitful results by joining hands in science.”
Larry Marshall, CEO of the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, said in an interview with a reporter from the China News Service in Beijing that the cooperation between Australia and China in the field of science and technology has shown great vitality from the cooperation in dealing with climate change to the “Tianyan” project.
As the largest national research institution in the Commonwealth of Australia, CSIRO has achieved many innovative research results in the fields of ocean, energy, biology, materials and astronomy.
CSIRO has maintained close cooperation with scientific research institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
“This is a lasting friendship that encompasses the trust of partners and the tradition of long-term cooperation.” Marshall said.
In May of this year, China's 500-meter spherical radio telescope - "China Sky Eye" installed the world's first 19-beam L-band receiver.
This is currently the most advanced 19-beam feed receiver in the world, jointly developed by Chinese and Australian scientists.
Marshall said that the successful development of the receiver is based on CSIRO's many years of technology accumulation. After the launch, the FAST survey speed will increase by 5 to 6 times, and more scientific observation targets will be expanded.
“This is a contribution of CSIRO to FAST.”
In addition to the above cooperation, CSIRO also has close cooperation with Chinese scientific research institutions in the construction of square kilometer array radio telescopes, research and development of new fuel technologies, energy conservation and emission reduction.
“In the past, scientific research often focused on problems after hundreds of years, and now more research is needed to solve the problems before them.”
Marshall believes that Australia and China are complementary in the field of scientific development, and both countries face a series of challenges in their development.
For example, extreme weather occurs frequently in the world. Drought and floods have led to a reduction in food production. Food shortages have seriously affected human development.
At the same time, population explosions, aging, and chronic diseases are also serious challenges.
"The cooperation between Australia and China in recent years is mainly focused on solving these current problems."
Marshall said that the International Southern Hemisphere Ocean Research Center, jointly established by CSIRO and the Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology, focuses on observing the El Niño and La Niña phenomena, studying the relationship between the two and extreme weather, and establishing extreme weather. Early warning facilities; new varieties of cereals developed by CSIRO and the Chinese Academy of Sciences to overcome extreme weather can also alleviate food shortages caused by extreme weather.
“In the current environment, technological innovation is difficult to accomplish on its own, it requires extremely high costs, and there are many problems to be solved, so cooperation is particularly important today.”
Marshall said that the closer the cooperation is, the more likely it is to make breakthroughs. This is also the significance of Australia and China in strengthening cooperation under the framework of the “Belt and Road” initiative.
"Strengthening bilateral cooperation is mainly for cooperation in science and technology for us."
For example, Marshall said that CSIRO has recently developed a gold purification method that does not use cyanide. Because the traditional cyanide gold purification method is very harmful to the environment, many countries hope to find a way to purify gold with little environmental pollution.
"We are very willing to introduce this technology to China. This is one of the results of our participation in the 'Belt and Road' cooperation."

North Korean Foreign Minister Li Yonghao told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued implementation of sanctions is deepening North Korea’s distrust of the United States, and North Korea cannot unilaterally abandon nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Li Yonghao said at the UN General Assembly that North Korea adopted a "very friendly approach" in the past year, including stopping missiles and nuclear tests, dismantling nuclear test sites, and pledging to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we did not see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"If you don't trust the United States, you have no confidence in our national security. Under such circumstances, we cannot unilaterally give up weapons."
Although Li Yonghao is repeating North Korea’s complaints against the US’s “phased” denuclearization, his speech is of great significance because it has not completely rejected unilateral denuclearization as it did before North Korea.
Li Yonghao mentioned Kim Jong-un and Trump's joint statement on June 12, when Kim Jong-un agreed to "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" and Trump promised to protect North Korea's security.
North Korea has been seeking to officially end the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States said that North Korea must first give up nuclear weapons.
The United States also refused to relax the requirements for North Korea’s international sanctions.
"The United States insists on 'first denuclearization' and increases the pressure on sanctions to achieve its goal by high-pressure means, and even refuses to issue a 'war declaration of war'," Li Yonghao said.
"The idea that sanctions can make us plead for mercy is that people who don't know us are daydreaming.
But the problem is that such continued sanctions are deepening our mistrust. ”
Li Yonghao did not mention the second special fund plan that the US president mentioned at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, he emphasized Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Wen Zaiyu’s three meetings in the past five months and said: “If the other side of denuclearization is South Korea instead of North Korea, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula will not become so deadlocked. ”

On July 1, the tax on cars and parts of 218 tax purposes was reduced.
After the tax reduction, the vehicle tax rate of China's auto vehicles has been lower than the average level of developing countries, in line with the actual situation of the Chinese auto industry.
This tax reduction will promote the restructuring of the industry and the optimal allocation of resources, accelerate the survival of the fittest, and help improve the quality of products and services. It is expected to promote the adjustment of automobile prices to a certain extent, so that consumers can get more benefits.
On July 1, the tax reduction of 1449 items of consumer goods for tax purposes.
The tax reduction of daily consumer goods is closely related to the people's need for a better life.
The tax reduction is not only large but also strong, with an average tax reduction of 56%.
The reduction of taxes on daily consumer goods directly benefits the consumers and promotes the competitiveness of domestic industries.
On November 1st, 1585 tax items will be tax-deducted for industrial products such as electromechanical equipment, parts and raw materials.
Appropriately reducing the import tariffs of some domestically needed industrial products can attract more foreign capital, help increase domestic effective supply, help industrial upgrading, and help enterprises allocate resources on a global scale, reduce production costs, and also benefit Reduce the pressure on the domestic environment.
The responsible person of the Office of the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council of China introduced that the above four independent tax reductions and the third step of tax reduction implemented on July 1 this year in accordance with the information technology agreement expansion scope negotiations will make China’s total tariff level from the previous year. 9.8% fell to 7.5%.
The adjusted total tariff level is slightly higher than that of the EU, lower than most developing countries, at a medium-low level, and basically matches the status and development stage of China's developing countries.
According to the person in charge, the overall level of tariffs, as one of the important indicators of the openness of China's trade in goods, should be compatible with the stage of China's economic development and reflect the characteristics of the times.
China's trade in goods is the largest in the world, and it has already had the economic foundation to further expand its openness. However, there is still a gap between the quality and efficiency of trade development compared with developed economies. Therefore, the overall level of tariffs should be appropriately lowered.
Tariffs are the means of compliance protection, tariff levels should be compatible with industrial competitiveness, and benign competition should be encouraged. Excessive protection is not conducive to industrial development and quality.
Tariff rate adjustment must balance production needs with consumer demand.
We will focus on reducing the commodity tax rate that has a large domestic demand, contribute to the transformation and upgrading of the industry, and strive to increase the import of characteristic superior products with relatively concentrated needs of the people, continuously enhance the sense of acquisition of enterprises and the public, and meet the upgrading needs of the industrial structure and consumption structure.
The tax reduction should balance the financial revenue and the affordability of industrial development.
In the choice of specific tax-reduction commodities and tax reductions, we must coordinate and coordinate the two domestic and international markets, the upstream and downstream aspects, production and consumption, and maintain the steady development of China's economy.
The person in charge stressed that this year is the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up. China's initiative to reduce the overall level of import tariffs is a major measure based on China's own needs to achieve high-quality development. It is conducive to the overall utilization of international and foreign resources, and promote the quality improvement of domestic supply systems. The people need to upgrade their consumption.
This action and measure shows that China will unswervingly pursue an open strategy of mutual benefit and win-win, firmly support economic globalization, resolutely uphold the principle of free trade and the multilateral trading system centered on the WTO, and continue to draw momentum from the opening up to the world. It also allows China to develop better and benefit the world.
Serbia declares to enter the state of maximum readiness. President of Russia will meet tomorrow to discuss the situation in Kosovo
The Nantong News Agency quoted the Serbian President’s Office as saying that Serbia’s President Vucic ordered the country’s armed forces to enter the state of maximum readiness, as Kosovo’s special forces occupied the passage of the water bank of the Gazivoda hydropower station controlled by Belgrade in northern Kosovo. .
On September 29, Serbian Defense Minister Wulin declared that the Serbian army has entered a state of full readiness.
The martial arts stressed that as long as the order issued by Vucic is still valid, Serbia will continue to monitor the current situation in Kosovo, and the Serbian army will respond no matter which direction the situation develops.
According to the Russian Tass news agency, on September 29, Vucic said in an interview that he has already informed the current situation with the United States, Russia and other parties, and will travel to Moscow on October 2 to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Kosovo. Seek support from Putin.
When asked if Serbia needs to obtain Russian military support like Syria, Vucic gave a negative answer: "I don't want a major military conflict in our territory."
Vucic also said that the Serbian army entered a state of full readiness just to form a deterrent to prevent the conflict, but it is also a clear warning: no violence will be tolerated in Kosovo.
The reason why the Serbian army has improved its readiness is related to the two major moves in Kosovo.
According to the Serbian side, Albanians have recently arrested Serbs living in the area for generations in the northern part of Kosovo, and these arrested Serbs did not violate any laws.
Vucic said that since March 26 this year, the head of the Serbian government Kosovo and Metohija office, Marco Urich, was beaten and detained by the Kosovo Armed Forces, the Albanians have escalated regional situation and made the Serbs inhuman. Arrest and drive away.
In addition, more than 100 people, including the ROSU Special Forces, armed police and snipers of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Kosovo, who had announced their own establishment, occupied the position near the storage lake of the Gazivoda hydropower station and entered the ecological vicinity of the northern dam of the Kosovo region. The sports center has blocked all roads nearby, and these areas were originally controlled by the Serbian side.
Vucic pointed out that this military adventure in Kosovo was made under the guise of the Western countries. The actions of the Kosovo army did not inform the Serbian side in advance, violating the first paragraph of Chapter IX of the Brussels Agreement and also violating The UN Security Council Resolution 1244 and the military technology agreement between Seco.
Vucic has already spoken to NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg, criticizing the hypocritical rhetoric of Western countries on the Kosovo issue.
The root cause of this conflict is still the centuries-old historical grievances between the two communities in Kosovo.
Regarding the affiliation of Kosovo, the Serbs and Albanians have different opinions.
Serbia regards Kosovo as the birthplace and cultural cradle of the nation, because Serbia established its most powerful country here in the 12th century, and the Albanians only moved in after the Ottoman invasion and the Serbian defeated the north.
The Albanians insisted that the original tribe Illyrians who lived in Kosovo in the 4th-5th centuries BC were the ancestors of the Albanians. Therefore, Kosovo has been the territory of the Albanians since ancient times.
Subjective political divisions have created fierce conflicts between different ethnic groups, religions and cultures, resulting in a fierce confrontation between Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo.
In 1912, Kosovo Albanians first declared Albania’s independence.
After the First World War, a large number of Albanians living in the Balkans moved to Turkey, and the proportion of Serbs rose relatively. In the eyes of the Serbs, “just returning their own land” was regarded as “big” by the Albanians. The plunder of "Serbianism" has intensified the contradictions between the two communities.
Kosovo has become a "gunpowder barrel" in the Balkans.
In 1999, armed conflicts between the Albanian separatists in the Kosovo Liberation Army and the Serbian army and police led to NATO troops bombing the Yugoslav Federation of Serbia and Montenegro, and the Kosovo war broke out.
On February 17, 2008, Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia.
Since then, there have been news that Serbia will normalize relations with Kosovo and sign a global and legally binding agreement. However, due to historical national grievances and geopolitical constraints, agreements based on various forces such as the US, Europe and Russia have not been signed. .
Just a month ago, Vucic made a clear statement for the first time that he advocated the separation of Serbs from the Albanians in Kosovo and publicized the contradictions between the two communities.

In the past five years, it has vigorously promoted the clean air action plan, and the environmental benefits have been continuously released, making the region The reduction in total pollutant emissions has laid the foundation for continued improvement in air quality.
Beijing officially released and implemented the “Beijing Clean Air Action Plan 2013-2017” in 2013.
According to the plan, the government continued to guide the non-capital function relief, promote energy clean-up replacement and pollution reduction work, and eliminated 4,923 coal-fired boilers.

While the air quality continues to improve, Beijing officially released the “Three-Year Action Plan for Beijing to Win the Blue Sky Defence War” in September this year, focusing on the current governance stage and pollution characteristics. Key areas of prevention and control of trucks, dust, volatile organic compounds, etc., optimize and adjust transportation structure, industrial structure, energy structure and land structure, strengthen regional joint prevention and control, focus on strengthening urban refined management, comprehensively promote green development, and strive to make "the bluest" The sky is always in the capital, no longer "things are rare", let it return to the background in people's albums rather than the protagonist.

In the past 20 years, the Chinese government has been paying attention to the treatment of newborns.
At present, the infant mortality rate in Shanghai has dropped to 3.71 ‰, which is significantly lower than the national average and reaches the advanced level of developed countries.
"China's NICU hospitalized premature infant prognosis quality improvement project" through four years of unremitting efforts, greatly improved the quality of life of premature infants.
Professor Cao Yun, director of the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of the Pediatric Hospital affiliated to Fudan University, told reporters that while improving the survival rate of premature infants, attention should be paid to reducing the quality of premature infants, reducing the incidence of complications, improving neurodevelopmental outcomes, and improving patients. The overall outcome of the child is of great significance for improving the overall quality of life and population quality of premature infants. It is an important issue of concern in the pediatric and neonatal departments at home and abroad, and it is also a key issue of this project.

After more than 10 years of continuous improvement, the uncomplicated survival rate of premature infants in Canada has increased by about 1/3. Canada is now one of the countries with the best prognosis in preterm infants worldwide.
The EPIQ method is now applied to all NICUs across Canada and has been adopted by six countries.
Pediatric hospitals revealed that the results of the study showed that after two years of EPIQ intervention, the infection of premature infants decreased by 35%, and the use rate of antibiotics decreased by 20%.
In the future, the Pediatric Hospital affiliated to Fudan University will continue to promote and implement this method nationwide, with a view to comprehensively reducing the incidence of all complications in preterm infants and improving the quality of treatment for newborns nationwide.

"I will cry for China one day when I live."
Through time and space, the heroes and heroes set up a spiritual road sign to guide the direction of the forward.
“Where to come from, where to go” “What kind of person to be?” It is not difficult to get an answer when reading English and heroic.

All kinds of distortions of history, derogation of heroes and heroes, challenges the conscience of justice, and misjudged value judgments, causing public outrage and vigilance in the whole society.
Heroes can't be tolerated, heroes can't forget.
The act of touching the bottom line cannot be ignored. It is necessary to dare to brighten the sword and defend the dignity of the hero with the rule of law.

Experts from the on-site observation and exchange activities of the national film-free cotton went into the experimental field and listened to the introduction of the representative of the academician Yu Shuxun of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.
Zhongxin.com, Xinjiang, Saudi Arabia, September 30th (Yu Dandan Wang Xiaojun) is located in the film-free cotton planting test base in Shaya County, Xinjiang. The film-free cotton grows gratifying and is “not inferior” compared with the film cotton next to it. Snow-white cotton competes for “openness” and is full of branches.
From September 27th to 28th, the nationwide film-free cotton on-site observation and discussion exchange activities were held in Shaya County, Xinjiang.
The reporter learned at the observation meeting that the "film-free cotton technology system with "Chong Mian 619" and its supporting cultivation measures as the main body has initially achieved the goal of film-free planting in cotton fields, reducing the residual environment of cotton fields in Xinjiang and the ecological environment and raw cotton. Significant progress has been made in the research and demonstration of pollution-free, membrane-free cotton.
Academician Yu Xuexun, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, famous cotton genetic breeder and chief scientist of the national modern agricultural industrial technology system, gave a briefing on the growth of non-membrane cotton to Zhou Guomo, secretary of the Party Committee of Zhejiang Agriculture and Forestry University.
“The integrated technology of the film-free cotton we developed can completely realize the cotton planting without the film, which can completely solve the problem of residual film pollution and realize green cotton planting.”
Yu Shuxun, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.
Xinjiang is China's most important cotton-producing region. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the cotton planting area in Xinjiang in 2017 was 35 million mu, accounting for 61% of the national cotton area.
Since the introduction of plastic film in China in 1982, the area of various types of crops in Xinjiang has reached more than 50 million mu, and the annual use of plastic film is about 300,000 tons.
Among them, cotton mulch coverage rate reached 100%, and cotton field mulching accounted for about 60% of Xinjiang mulch film use.
No film cotton is used for production measurement, and cotton production can be achieved from 320 kg to 350 kg per mu.
With the increasing amount of plastic film input in Xinjiang, the residual film recovery rate is low, the amount of residual film in the soil is gradually increasing, and the residual film causes soil structure damage and other problems, which seriously affects the sustainable development of agriculture.
The residual film not only causes serious pollution to the soil, but also has a great influence on the quality of cotton fiber.
At present, more than one-third of the cotton fields in Xinjiang have achieved mechanized harvesting.
In 2017, Xinjiang's machine cotton mining area is about 14 million mu.
In the process of harvesting cotton, a large amount of surface film and cotton film on the cotton plant are harvested. The broken film doped in the raw cotton is difficult to remove during the processing of raw cotton, and can not be completely removed in the subsequent textile processing process, seriously affecting the quality of textile products. .
On September 28th, the nationwide film-free cotton on-site observation and discussion exchange activities were held in Shaya County, Xinjiang.
In order to solve the cotton film mulch pollution, simplify the cotton planting technology and improve the cotton field efficiency, Yu Shuxun led his team through 8 years to implement the “Zhongmian 619” filmless cotton technology planting, adding “wings” to Xinjiang's agricultural green development.
Yu Shuxun introduced, through innovative breeding new ideas, to cultivate a new line of early cotton, salt-tolerant, low-temperature, high-yield land cotton "Zhongmian 619".
“ 'Zhongmian 619' has achieved a series of supporting equipments such as membrane-free seeding machinery, improved seeding depth, shallow drip tube under membrane-free conditions, suitable seeding density screening, and reasonable chemical regulation under the condition of no-membrane cultivation in southern Xinjiang. Measures."
At present, Aksu, Korla, Alar and other places have established a demonstration base for film-free cotton, with a yield of 4,800 kg per hectare.
Film-free cotton planting has achieved high yield, savings, environmental protection and improved overall benefits.
Zhang Donghai, an agronomist at the Third Division of the Agricultural Production and Construction Corps of Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, said that through nearly six years of research and demonstration of non-membrane cotton cultivation techniques, the production of non-membrane cottonseed cotton can achieve a yield of 320 kg to 350 kg per mu, or even higher.
“The promotion of non-membrane cotton cultivation technology has great prospects.”
Zhang Donghai believes that at present, the non-membrane cotton cultivation technology can completely solve the problem of soil residual film pollution, but there is still a certain gap between the current economic benefits and the cultivation of plastic film.
“The support of cotton purchase price will be conducive to future promotion.”
Yu Shuxun said that in the next step, he and his team will continue to conduct in-depth research and large-scale promotion and application of the film-free cotton, making the industry of film-free cotton bigger and stronger, and completely solving the problem of soil pollution caused by the film.

However, the flight to and from Hong Kong in Ningxia is inconvenient. Fortunately, the high-speed rail section of Hong Kong is open to traffic. After checking the train schedule, Mr. Song found that the first shuttle bus arrived at 7:3 am and connected the city transportation to the Golden Bauhinia Square. The time was just right. .
He sighed with the reporter: "The high-speed rail is too convenient, fast and punctual!"
The 70-hour one-hour short-distance train between Guangzhou South, Shenzhen North and Futian and West Kowloon daily has greatly facilitated the arrival of residents from Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau Bay Area.

According to the trade agreement subsidiary plan announced on Monday, the new US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement will retain US President Trump's ability to impose a 25% tariff threat on imported cars, while at the same time importing imports from Canada and Mexico. Cars, pickups and auto parts are basically exempt from paying customs duties.
If Trump imposes a so-called “232 chapter” tariff on cars for national security reasons, both Mexico and Canada will have a passenger car quota that is exempt from taxing 2.6 million vehicles a year.
According to the subsidiary arrangement, the pickup trucks produced in both countries will be fully exempted from tariffs.
If Trump imposes auto tariffs, Mexico will receive an annual tax exemption quota of $108 billion for auto parts, and Canada will receive a $32.4 million quota.
Both quotas are much higher than the current production levels of the two countries, providing room for growth for both countries' exports.
Reuters Washington/Mexico September 28 - Mexico said on Friday that after several days of debate, US President Trump's government and Canada are making effective efforts to resolve trade policy differences and make the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) ) It is expected to maintain the form of the tripartite agreement.
Despite the lack of detail, the above-mentioned obvious progress is enough to prompt the Mexican and US governments to suddenly stop publishing plans for the text of the two-party trade agreement, giving Canada more time to join the agreement.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told reporters in Mexico that the US government has proposed a new counter-proposal to the Canadian government and said he will continue to urge all three countries to participate in NAFTA.
Mexican economic minister Ildefonso Guajardo said that the time to submit the text of the US-Mexico trade agreement to Mexico and the United States was postponed because the Canadian and US governments "tryed very hard" to reach an agreement.
Gujarud said, “In the next 48 hours, we will know whether we are reaching a text of a tripartite agreement or have to publish the text of the two-party agreement.”
Guahardo said that his US and Canadian officials at the same level "specially requested" to postpone the publication of the text.
A spokesperson for the US Trade Representative Office (USTR) did not comment on the text of the US-Mexico trade agreement and the US-Canada consultations.
Officials from the Office of the Prime Minister of Canada and the Office of the Minister of Foreign Affairs did not respond to requests for comment on counter-proposals.
According to foreign media reports, in a conservation center on the outskirts of Pretoria, South Africa, two little lions play together and it is difficult to see any abnormalities, but they are unique.
The University of Pretoria announced: “This is the first cub to be born by artificial insemination – the first pair in the world.”
School scientists are working to study the reproductive system of the female African lion.
Gans Winter, director of the Institute of Mammals at the University of Pretoria, said that the two lion cubs born on August 25 were quite healthy and normal.
After 18 months of intensive trials, his team finally reached this breakthrough.
Ganswinter said in an interview with the media: "We collect sperm from a healthy male lion."
Next, when the lion's hormone content in the lion's body is at a suitable level, the artificial insemination is carried out.
Gans Winter said: "Fortunately, the results are successful."
He said the researchers "made several attempts, but unexpectedly, they didn't take much effort."
He said that the aforementioned research breakthroughs can be repeated and that scientists hope to use this technology to save endangered large cats.
According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the lion has been extinct in 26 African countries. The total number of surviving wild lions has dropped by 43% in the past 20 years, leaving only about 20,000.
African lions are listed as vulnerable animals by this organization.
Ganswinter said: "If we don't do something for this animal, they will face extinction."
He said that this new technology does not require the lion to receive breeding, but instead puts sperm into the fertile lioness, just as North America and Europe do for captive elephants.
South Korea's September exports fell the most in more than two years, but analysts attributed the decline to fewer working days, and said that despite the rising trade tension between China and the United States, global demand for Korean goods is still strong.
Indeed, South Korea’s average daily exports increased last month.
In addition, preliminary data released earlier showed a double-digit increase in exports in the first few weeks of September before the long holidays.
South Korea's exports in September fell by the same amount since July 2016, which was greater than the 5.7% decline in the estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Reuters.
Initial figures released on Monday showed that exports in September were $50.6 billion, down from $51.2 billion in August.
Although the growing US-China trade dispute may have caused other export-dependent Chinese neighbors to suffer, South Korea’s exports to China increased by 7.8 percent in September, expanding for the 23rd consecutive month.
South Korea’s exports to the US fell by 11.8%, as sales of petroleum products fell.
Overseas sales of Korean memory chips and petroleum products increased by 28.3% and 13.5% respectively, despite market concerns that the so-called "super cycle" of chips may have peaked.
“However, the impact of trade conflicts will be difficult to avoid because South Korea’s exports depend to a large extent on the US and Chinese markets.”
Imports fell 2.1% to $40.8 billion, which is not as expected by a Reuters survey of 3.1%.
The initial value of the September trade surplus was $9.7 billion, up from $6.9 billion in August.
The Ministry of Industry said that thanks to the US and EU countries, global manufacturing will remain buoyant, which is a favorable factor for Korean exports.
The statement pointed out that “the increase in export prices caused by the rise in oil prices will also benefit exports in the second half of this year.”
"But the trade conflict between the United States and China continues, and the market volatility after the US interest rate hikes is a negative pressure on exports."
In September, the average export value per working day increased to 2.6 billion US dollars, and in August it was 2.1 billion US dollars.
South Korea’s Mid-Autumn Festival this year falls on September 24-26, so it was only 19.5 working days in September, four days less than the same period last year.
South Korea's exports from January to September increased by 4.7 percent compared with the same period last year.
According to the Nikkei/Markit Purchasing Managers Index, South Korean manufacturing activity rebounded in September, but was supported by domestic orders, as orders from China and Japan fell, which threatened to blew the outlook for another export.
North Korean media criticized the United States for not relaxing sanctions against the DPRK
North Korea's "Labor News" published a signed commentary on September 30, criticizing the United States for seeking a dialogue with the DPRK while not relaxing the sanctions against the DPRK, saying that this is a "self-contradictory" approach.
The article said that US Secretary of State Pompeo said on the 14th that "the key to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is to fulfil sanctions against the DPRK" and stressed that the United States will continue to implement the UN sanctions resolution.
In the Singapore-US-US Joint Statement, the two sides pledged to establish a new DPRK-US relationship that is compatible with the aspirations of the people of the DPRK and the United States to look forward to peace and prosperity.
The United States is undoubtedly contradictory when it increases pressure on sanctions and demands dialogue.
The article said that if we are to establish a new DPRK-US relationship, build a permanent and consolidated peace system on the Korean Peninsula, and achieve a complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, we should build trust in the first place, starting from what we can do and solving it step by step.
The article also said that the United States should understand that sanctions will not work for North Korea.
The article said that even the "North Devonsk" before the "Kazan" number made the US military admire.
The National Interest magazine quoted the US Navy as saying: "We will encounter strong potential opponents. Just look at the 'Northern Devinsk' submarine."
The US military’s current commander-in-chief of the European Navy, Fogo, also praised the “Northern Devensk” submarine.
He said: "This submarine is impressive. If you look at the development of the Russian Navy and how to use the resources, you will know that the main effort in research and development is to strengthen the submarine fleet."
However, National Interest magazine still believes that the United States maintains its advantage over Russia in this field.
Fogo said: "I believe that Western countries still have an asymmetric advantage."
Earlier, it was reported that the Russian Navy will install the "Kazan" submarine in 2019.
The “Kazan”, “Novosibirsk”, “Krasnoyarsk” and “Arkhangelsk” multi-purpose submarines are all improved in “ash tree-M” with a displacement of 13,800 tons. It has a depth of 520 meters, a staffing capacity of 64 people and a submarine speed of 31 knots. It will carry mines, torpedoes and "caliber" and "agate" cruise missiles.

Ignore the American threat!
EU may reach crude oil purchase agreement with Iran
The US government announced that it will restart a new round of sanctions against Iran in November and even urge other countries to reduce imports of Iranian oil.
However, American allies do not seem to listen to it.
According to the US "New York Times" report, on the 29th, Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif said in an interview that although the United States threatened to sanction any country that does business with Iran, Tehran is close to the EU to reach an agreement on the sale of crude oil.
The core purpose of this agreement is to try to establish a new payment mechanism, which is to replace the dollar transaction in the form of barter or local currency.
The purpose of this approach is to bypass the United States and prevent the United States from impeding financial transfers.
At the same time, although the EU is working on the agreement, some French and British officials are also worried that if the agreement is realized, it will be the most open confrontation between the EU and the United States against the US withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear agreement.
The US media said that in an interview in an hour, Zarif’s words sounded more optimistic than in recent months.
Because the agreement has the ability to "strip" the traditional American allies, effectively breaking the US's attempts to cut Iran's income.
“This will ensure that we sell oil and benefit,” Zarif believes, according to the agreement reached in 2015, countries have the legal right to trade with Iran.
The head of EU foreign policy, Federica Moguerini, also said recently that "no sovereign country or organization can accept other people to decide who they can trade with."
However, she also predicted that before the US government launched the next step of sanctions in November, US leaders could adopt a series of financial instruments aimed at banks, businessmen and countries that have business dealings with Tehran.
In May of this year, the US government unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear agreement on the grounds that the agreement was flawed, saying that the agreement could not permanently ban Iran from producing nuclear fuel.
The US then threatened to ban companies that buy Iranian oil and other commodities from doing business in the United States.
This threat caused some companies to withdraw from Tehran and the Iranian currency plummeted.
Companies such as Airbus and French oil giant Total have cancelled billions of dollars in investment in Iraq.
British and French officials have said that the US government may "take the upper hand."
Sure enough, according to a recent report by the Turkish media, the US sanctions do not seem to have a major impact on Iran’s oil exports.
Iranian Oil Minister Zangane recently revealed that no country other than South Korea has stopped buying Iranian oil.
Both Zarif and Iranian President Rohani believe that the purpose of a series of US actions is to "seduce" Iran's breach of the agreement.
Zarif also dismissed the US serial port attack. When asked if the US would overthrow the current Iranian government with increasing financial pressure, Zarif even laughed. "It is a regime change." Strategy, this is the true purpose of the US."

After the approval of Premier Li Keqiang, the State Council issued a "Decision on Further Regulating the Catalogue of Management of Production Licenses for Industrial Products and Simplifying the Approval Process".
The "Decision" proposes to further reduce the management catalogue of production licenses for industrial products, cancel the management of production licenses for 14 industrial products, and delegate the management authority for production licenses of four types of industrial products to the quality and technical supervision departments of provincial people's governments.

The "Decision" requires that all regions and relevant departments should solidly promote the reduction of catalogues and simplify the examination and approval procedures.
Increase the commitment of enterprises to publicize and post-site inspections, strengthen credit supervision and restraint methods, and implement the main responsibility of enterprise quality. For false promises and non-compliance, all production licenses shall be revoked.

Take support measures to encourage enterprises to carry out voluntary certification and promote brand building and market expansion.
It is necessary to benchmark the international advanced standards and promote the quality of industrial products.
Give full play to the role of third-party social organizations to ensure the quality and safety of industrial products.
For products that retain industrial product production license management, we must improve the standard system, give play to the advantages of industry supervision, strengthen the responsibility of “who approves and supervise”, dynamically assess product quality and safety risks, timely reduce catalogues, decentralize approval authority or convert to certification. management.
In September, China's comprehensive PMI rose compared with the manufacturing PMI.
According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics of China on the 30th, China's comprehensive PMI output index was 54.1% in September, higher than the previous month and the annual average of 0.3 and 0.1 percentage points, indicating that the overall production and operation activities of Chinese enterprises remained stable.
In the same month, the manufacturing production index and the non-manufacturing business activity index, which constitute the comprehensive PMI output index, were 53.0% and 54.9%, respectively, down one liter per month.
Among them, China's manufacturing PMI was 50.8%, down 0.5 percentage points from the previous month.
Zhao Qinghe said that this month's manufacturing PMI has five main characteristics:
First, the fundamentals of the manufacturing industry are generally stable.
Among the 21 industries surveyed, the PMI of 14 industries is in the expansion range. The manufacturing PMI of pharmaceuticals, special equipment, electrical machinery and equipment, etc. are all at a higher operating level of 53.5%, and the growth rate is faster.
Second, supply and demand fluctuated slightly.
The production index and the new order index were 53.0% and 52.0%, respectively, down 0.3 and 0.2 percentage points from the previous month. Supply and demand continued to maintain a booming state, but the expansion slowed slightly.
The new export order index and import index were 48.0% and 48.5%, respectively, lower than the previous month's 1.4 and 0.6 percentage points, and the prosperity fell to the low of the year.

Nagoya, Reuters, November 5 - Bank of Japan President Kuroda said on Monday that the central bank realized that long-term implementation of ultra-loose monetary policy could squeeze financial institutions' profit margins and could undermine the stability of the country's banking system.
But he said that given the sluggish inflation and the uncertainty of overseas economies, the Bank of Japan needs to maintain its massive stimulus plan while paying close attention to the pros and cons of its policies.
“The Bank of Japan fully acknowledges that under the continued monetary easing, the strength of financial institutions will be increasingly affected,” Kuroda said in a speech to business leaders in Nagoya.
He said that if financial institutions are more active in taking risks to compensate for the narrowing of profit margins caused by low interest rates over the years, once there is a serious negative impact, the banking system may be in turmoil.
“Although these risks are not large at present, the central bank will pay close attention to the development of the situation and encourage financial institutions to take the necessary measures,” he said.
The minutes of the Bank of Japan meeting announced earlier on Monday showed that at the September meeting on interest rates, the Bank of Japan Policy Committee discussed the rising costs of long-term easing.
According to the minutes of the meeting, one member said that if the economy continues to expand, “the Bank of Japan will have more room for flexibility in terms of policies in the future.”
According to the minutes of the meeting, another member said that in view of the limitations of the policy duration, the committee should discuss how long the Bank of Japan can maintain the stimulus policy.
Kuroda said that the Bank of Japan will assess the financial risks brought about by the easing policy, while also considering the uncertainty surrounding the Japanese economic outlook, because Sino-US trade frictions and rising protectionism may affect global demand.
"The impact of such problems on the Japanese economy is temporarily limited," said Kuroda.
“But how the problem continues and the impact on the Japanese economy may become bigger,” he added.
“It is necessary to continue to implement strong monetary easing policies while considering positive and negative impacts in a balanced manner,” said Kuroda.
Despite the increased shortcomings of the radical stimulus plan, such as long-term low interest rates eroding the profits of financial institutions, the low inflation has forced the Bank of Japan to maintain the plan.
The Bank of Japan maintained its monetary policy last month; in the face of the risks posed by the global trade war, Kuroda has ruled out the possibility of a recent rate hike.
June 1, 2018, Cardiff, United States, the corporate logo on the electric car.
Under a settlement agreement, US Tesla Motors and its CEO, Musk, have agreed to pay $20 million in fines to financial regulators. Musk will also resign as chairman of the company but still serve as CEO.
The settlement agreement will end Tesla's two-month turmoil.
The Securities and Exchange Commission’s settlement of the securities fraud allegation settlement on Saturday will give investors a sigh of relief.
Investors were worried that the protracted legal battle would only further dampen the still-losing electric car company.
The SEC sued Mask for fraud on Thursday, saying its August 7 tweets misled investors.
The tweet said he is considering privatizing Tesla for $420 per share and has received financing.
The SEC said that these tweets were virtually unfounded and that the market turmoil caused by them hurt investors.
Investors and corporate governance experts say the agreement may enhance Tesla, which was hit hard by Musk's recent actions.
Steven Heim, head of Boston Common Asset Management, said the settlement should give Musk more supervision and did not take "destructive" measures to get him out of Tesla.
The asset management company holds Tesla's battery manufacturer Panasonic stock.
Under the proposed agreement, Tesla must appoint an independent chairman, two independent directors, and a board committee to develop controls for Musk's external communications.
“This matter is quickly resolved in accordance with agreed terms and conditions in line with our market and our investors, including the best interests of Tesla shareholders,” SEC Chairman Clayton said in a statement.
The allegations on Thursday caused Tesla's market value to evaporate about $7 billion. The company's market value was $45.2 billion on Friday, which was lower than General Motors' $47.5 billion.
The SEC retracted Musk’s request to take over the company’s head in the settlement agreement.
Many investors say that this punishment will be disastrous.
“I think this is the best possible outcome for all involved,” Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial Partners said. Feinseth gave Tesla a “neutral” rating and said the SEC’s penalty was “for Light punishment".
"He is still a CEO and is very important to Tesla."
Both Musk and Tesla did not acknowledge or deny the SEC’s allegations in the settlement agreement, nor did they immediately respond to the request for comment.
The settlement agreement still requires court approval.
Beijing Morning News (Reporter Wang Ping) Beijing Morning News reporter recently learned from Beijing Construction Engineering Group that one of the core buildings of the 2019 Beijing World Garden Park, the Beijing World Garden Performing Arts Plaza project, will adopt the multi-color ETFE puzzle film structure for the first time. The film structure of 5,440 square meters will display six colors of deep red, dark green, orange, blue, red and green. It will show the shape of "butterfly wings" under the tension of the cable strands.
According to Liu Changbao, project leader of Beijing Construction Engineering Wujian Group, the construction area of the Performing Arts Plaza is 4,500 square meters, and the total installed steel capacity is 1,182 tons. The steel structure roof is supported by a 26-inch umbrella-shaped cantilevered steel truss. The tension of the steel strands shows the shape of the "butterfly wings".
“Overlooking the Performing Arts Square from the air, the colorful roofs are like butterflies that dance through the flowers and dance, and the bright colors will not fade with the passage of time and the wind, rain and snow.”
Previously, the monochromatic ETFE membrane structure was widely used in the Bird's Nest, Water Cube and other projects, but the ETFE membrane structure of multi-color puzzles was the first in the country.
The reporter learned that because there are very few suppliers with a variety of color film structure production capacity in the world, each inch of membrane structural materials is very "precious".
Liu Changbao said that in order to avoid overlapping and "fighting" problems at the end of the cable head, the "double-fork" cable head structure will be innovated, and the special fixed inserts will ensure that the "fighting" cable ends are in the correct position.
At present, the construction of the 2019 Beijing World Garden Park is underway.
Among them, the International Pavilion project has completed the hoisting construction of all “flower umbrellas”.
According to the plan, the project will be ready for deployment at the end of October.

General Secretary Xi Jinping delivered a very important speech at the private enterprise symposium, injecting firm confidence into the broader stage of the private economy.
General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized that “letting entrepreneurs unload their thoughts and carry forward lightly” has a strong resonance among entrepreneurs and innovative entrepreneurs.
Market vitality comes from people, especially from entrepreneurs, from entrepreneurship.
In the course of the 40 years of reform and opening up, there are thousands of entrepreneurial entrepreneurial innovation stories, and the growth and expansion of the entrepreneurial community has continuously pushed the Chinese economy to break the waves.
For some time, some people in the society have published some remarks that negate and doubt the private economy.
The so-called "private economic departure theory" and "new public-private partnership theory" and other misconceptions have caused some entrepreneurs' doubts and concerns.
Recently, some private enterprises have encountered many difficulties and problems in their business development.
For example, the changes in the international economic environment have had an impact on some export enterprises; the rapid adjustment of the demand structure has brought about the pressure of transformation and upgrading; some policies are not coordinated with each other, the policy effects are superimposed in the same direction, or the working methods are simple, resulting in some original intentions being good policies. The opposite effect and so on.
All kinds of factors are intertwined, the private economy is facing difficulties, some private enterprises are facing difficulties, and entrepreneurs show a lot of anxiety.
In this context, it is particularly profound and practical to correct the misunderstandings in understanding, to unload the entrepreneur's ideological burden, and to let the enterprise develop wholeheartedly. The government's single-minded development promotes market confidence and development expectations.
This symposium once again emphasized the important assertion that "three have not changed": "The status and role of the non-public economy in China's economic and social development has not changed!"
From deepening the promotion of decentralization and decentralization, establishing a power list system to creating a rule of law environment that protects the legitimate rights and interests of entrepreneurs, creating a fair competitive market environment and shaping the atmosphere of respecting entrepreneurs in the whole society. In recent years, the Party Central Committee has attached importance to entrepreneurs. The system guarantee is unprecedented.
The symposium also clearly put forward policy measures to support the development and expansion of private enterprises in six aspects, and launched a series of pragmatic actions dedicated to the “light forward” of private enterprises.
These have greatly encouraged the entrepreneurial community and have given more expectations to the community.
The fog has been set aside, and the policy has been set. The key lies in implementation.
We must continue to create a better development environment for the private economy, help private enterprises solve the difficulties in development, and help realize the transformation and upgrading of China's economy. Let entrepreneurs feel fair in market competition, feel safe in legal business, and feel in social life. Respect, stimulate innovation and create potential.
The Chinese economy has entered a process of moving toward high-quality development, requiring more entrepreneurs to display their ambitions and providing more space and stage for entrepreneurs to exert their creativity.
We have reason to believe that with further deepening reforms and removing obstacles, the private economy will usher in better development prospects and development opportunities and move toward a broader stage.

During the 73rd UN General Assembly, the parties released some positive messages around the Korean Peninsula issue.
South Korean President Wen Zaiyu recounted the DPRK’s "irreversible" nuclear abandonment and said that US President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un may meet before the end of this year.
The US State Department subsequently stated that Secretary of State Pompeo will visit North Korea in October to promote the implementation of the US-DPRK leaders’ meeting in Singapore.
From the beginning of this year to the present, the DPRK and the ROK broke the road of opening dialogue with the ice, and the DPRK-ROK, DPRK-US leaders met. The general trend of the easing of the peninsula continued, and the principle of dialogue and resolution of the peninsula was adhered to.
First of all, the fact that "the essence of the peninsula problem is a security issue" has not changed. The key to realizing peace on the peninsula is to properly and balancedly resolve the legitimate security concerns of all parties, instead of putting pressure on each other and blindly emphasizing one's own demands.
Secondly, in the dialogue to realize the denuclearization of the peninsula, the parties concerned are still divided on the steps and ways to realize the denuclearization of the peninsula. Due to the long-term lack of political trust between the DPRK and the United States, the game thinking of “who is first and then who is behind” is still strong.
At the public meeting of the Security Council’s Korean Peninsula issue held at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, the different voices of the parties around the issue of sanctions against the DPRK once again highlighted the two points on the peninsula that have not changed.
US Secretary of State Pompeo insisted that sanctions against North Korea will not be lifted until the Korean Peninsula is fully denuclearized.
The Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov stressed the principle of "responding to action by action". He pointed out: "The weakening trend of sanctions should be in sync with the pace taken by North Korea on the road of gradual abandonment."
Undoubtedly, all parties concerned should continue to implement the resolutions of the Security Council in a comprehensive, complete and accurate manner. However, pressure is not an end. The implementation of sanctions and the promotion of a political settlement are all requirements of the Security Council resolution. The two cannot be neglected. .
As Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, in view of the current positive developments in the DPRK-ROK and DPRK-US relations, China believes that it is necessary for the Security Council to consider launching reversible clauses in a timely manner, thereby encouraging North Korea and relevant parties to move toward denuclearization. pace of.
Looking back on the past, every development in the denuclearization of the peninsula and in the peace process requires the parties to demonstrate sufficient political courage.
At present, in the face of the international community’s growing expectations for promoting a political solution to the peninsula, all parties concerned should demonstrate political courage, make political decisions, implement commitments, resolve problems, and continue to take the opposite steps to advance the peninsula in parallel. The denuclearization process and the establishment of a peace mechanism on the peninsula will jointly create a permanent peace on the peninsula.

Reuters, Tokyo, October 1 - The Bank of Japan’s quarterly survey released on Monday showed that the confidence of large Japanese manufacturers in September was hit by the lowest level in more than a year, due to rising raw material costs and a series of natural disasters affecting production. The company feels the pressure.
The survey barely shows that the escalating global trade friction has hit the confidence of large manufacturers.
However, the risk of a full-scale trade war has hit the business prospects of enterprises and may threaten corporate capital expenditures.
Active capital expenditures are a bright spot in the Japanese economy.
The survey raises questions about the Bank of Japan’s view that a solid economic expansion will help push the inflation rate to a 2% target, although there are signs that companies are gradually passing costs on to customers.
“With the global trade war causing concern, manufacturers’ confidence has tended to stagnate due to slower exports and weak factory production,” said Nan Wuzhi, chief researcher at the Agriculture and Forestry China Gold Research Institute.
“Confidence is still at a high level. And because corporate profits are improving and prices are rising, I don’t think confidence will continue to decline.”
The Tankan survey showed that the September large-scale manufacturing sentiment judgment index fell from positive 21 to positive 19 three months ago, which was the third consecutive quarter of deterioration.
The median estimate for the market is positive 22.
In September, the large non-manufacturing boom judgment index fell to positive 22 from the positive 24 survey in June, which was the first time in eight quarters.
The Reuters survey was positive 22.
According to the survey, the large-scale manufacturing and non-manufacturing prosperity judgment indices are expected to remain stable in December.
Investors did not care about the decline in the short-term corporate sentiment judgment index. The Nikkei Stock Index. N225 rose to a 27-year high on Monday, as the continued depreciation of the yen helped improve the export earnings prospects of Japanese companies.
Capital expenditures are stable.
Despite the decline in corporate confidence, the latest short-sighted view highlights the robustness of corporate capital expenditure plans, thanks to increased capacity and increased investment in robotics and automation to cope with the labor shortage caused by an aging population.
The central bank's Tankan survey shows that large companies plan to increase capital expenditure by 13.4% in the fiscal year ending March 2019.
The previous Tankan survey was 13.6%.
Nan Wuzhi said that the capital expenditure plan of all enterprises in this fiscal year increased by 8.5 percent, close to the pace of the Japanese bubble economy era.
He said, “In view of the small company’s profit forecast from now on, there is still room for further growth in capital expenditures, but this depends to a large extent on the impact of trade wars on business confidence.”
The Tankan survey shows that the ability of enterprises to pass on costs has increased. The output price index of large enterprises is positive, which is a high point in a decade. This is an encouraging sign, reflecting Japan's efforts to combat deflation.
The index measuring the employment situation of large enterprises hit a negative 23, the most intense level since 1992, highlighting the tight employment market.
Benefiting from strong corporate spending, the second quarter of the Japanese economy rebounded from the shrinking of January-March this year.
However, the summer trade friction has escalated and the supply chain has been disrupted by natural disasters, which has eclipsed the prospect of export-dependent Japanese economy.
In dollar terms, the growth rate of import and export of services was 16.4%.
The press release of the Ministry of Commerce website quoted the person in charge of the Department of Trade and Industry as saying that the total import and export volume of emerging services exceeded 1 trillion yuan from January to August, and the growth rate was faster than the overall.
Among them, the total import and export of emerging services was 1,338.39 billion yuan, an increase of 20.9%, which was higher than the overall growth rate of service import and export by 10.4 percentage points, which boosted the proportion of emerging services by nearly 3 percentage points.
In terms of service exports, from January to August, service exports continued their rapid growth this year, and the growth rate of exports was 5.7 percentage points higher than the growth rate of imports.
Among them, the top three areas of growth rate are telecommunications computer and information services, personal culture and entertainment services, and insurance services, with growth rates of 61.1%, 38.8%, and 26.5%, respectively.
The head of the Department of Trade and Industry also pointed out that the proportion of new services imports from January to August has also gradually increased.
From January to August, the import of emerging services grew rapidly, accounting for 23.6 percent of service imports, an increase of 1.6 percentage points over the same period last year.
Among them, the growth rate of financial services, intellectual property fees, telecommunications computers and information services imports exceeded 20%, accounting for 47.1%, 23.3% and 23.2% respectively.

The 69th International Astronautical Congress opens in Germany
Xinhua News Agency, Bremen, Germany, October 1st (Reporter Ren Yi Zhang Yirong) The 69th International Astronautical Congress kicked off on October 1st at the Bremen Exhibition Center in Germany, with more than 6,300 astronauts, space agencies and business representatives from all over the world. Experts and scholars and young students attended.
The president of the International Astronautical Federation, Jean-Yves Legar, delivered a speech at the opening ceremony, saying that the global space industry is no longer only a small number of countries and institutions, and the number of participants this year has increased significantly from the previous session, indicating more and more The institutions and people are joining.
He called on countries to strengthen cooperation and innovation and jointly promote the development of the aerospace industry.
Zhang Kejun, deputy director of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and director of the National Space Administration, introduced China's space program during the exchange activities and said that China will expand international cooperation in the space field and contribute to the human space industry.
China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation and other related organizations and representatives of private enterprises attended the show, demonstrating the latest achievements of China Aerospace, including various types of launch vehicles, satellites and aerospace technology applications.
The International Astronautical Congress has been held annually since 1950 and is the largest event in the world aviation community.
The five-day conference was co-sponsored by the International Astronautical Federation, the International Academy of Astronautics, the University of Bremen Applied Science and Microgravity Research Center, and the International Institute of Space Law.
Reuters, Beijing, November 5 - The China Foreign Trade Center released a press release on Sunday saying that the Canton Fair shows that China's foreign trade situation remains complex and grim, with 80.6% of companies expecting exports to be better than last year or flat in 2018.
However, considering the external environment in which the cost of comprehensive factors such as raw materials and labor force continues to rise and the trade friction between China and the United States has increased, exhibitors also believe that the export situation next year is not optimistic.
At the closing press conference of the 124th Canton Fair, Xu Bing, deputy secretary general of the Canton Fair, spokesperson and deputy director of the China Foreign Trade Center, said that the number of overseas buyers and export transactions of the Canton Fair had dropped slightly year-on-year.
This year's buyers came to 189,812 people from 215 countries and regions, down 1.11% year-on-year.
The export turnover was RMB 20,694 million (equivalent to USD 29.86 billion), a year-on-year decrease of 1%.
From the market perspective, the turnover of Japan, the 10 ASEAN countries, the BRIC countries and South Korea increased by 74.4%, 11.4%, 7.2% and 2.5% respectively, and the traditional markets such as the United States, Australia, Canada and the EU decreased by 30.3% and 8.9 respectively. %, 7.3 %, 0.8 %.
From the industry perspective, transportation tools, machinery and equipment, construction and decoration materials, consumer electronics and information products, and sanitary equipment increased by 24.8%, 21.1%, 20.0%, 15.1%, and 7.6%, respectively, and textiles, clothing, and household appliances decreased by 13.0%. , 6.7 %.
Xu Bing said that as a barometer and a weather vane of China's foreign trade, the current situation of the Canton Fair buyers and the export transaction data indicate that China's foreign trade development will still face many uncertain and unstable factors next year.
However, with the deepening of the supply-side structural reforms and the recent introduction of “six stable” policies and measures by the state and local governments, the new kinetic energy of China’s foreign trade development is accelerating, and the market diversification continues to make new progress. They are all important foundations and powerful conditions for the development of foreign trade.
"Integrating all factors, it is expected that China's foreign trade import and export will maintain steady growth throughout the year, and quality and efficiency will be further improved." Xu Bing said.
China's General Administration of Customs announced that exports in US dollars in September increased by 14.5% year-on-year, imports increased by 14.3% year-on-year, and the trade surplus in September was US$31.69 billion. The export growth rate and trade surplus in September were the highest since February this year.
Despite the escalating trade friction between China and the United States, China’s export performance in September still exceeded expectations. The strong external demand and the devaluation of the RMB exchange rate before the US imposed tariffs on the United States, or the main supporting factors, also showed the resilience of China’s foreign trade to a certain extent. However, the impact of the Sino-US trade war on confidence and the impact on the industrial chain cannot be underestimated. Analysts believe that the challenges of China's foreign trade may appear in the fourth quarter or next year.
Reuters survey showed that US fund managers suggested increasing their holdings of cash in September and continued to be cautious because the United States and China began the latest round of import tariffs, and there was no sign of easing in the dispute.
However, according to the 12 fund managers who participated in the survey, the asset allocation in North America increased to the highest since June 2017, while the positions in the UK and the Eurozone, especially in emerging markets, declined.
Global stock allocations accounted for an average of 56.6 percent, and bonds accounted for 35.5 percent, basically in line with last month's survey.
The most obvious change is that the cash ratio has risen to 5.1%, the highest since December 2014.
The fund manager of a large fund company said, “Some economic data have brought confidence to the market, but the trade war is still the biggest concern, so it is best to be prepared to enter when the market falls back.”
But fund managers still prefer stocks in September, especially in US stocks, even though US stocks are considered to be overpriced.
Today, in China's open landmark Shanghai, the world's first large-scale national exhibition with the theme of import--China International Import Expo, officially kicked off in the expectation of Wanzhong.
An exhibition is like a “window” that allows the world to better understand a city and a country.
Through the “window” of the Expo, people have seen “opening China” towards a higher level. With the “window” of the Expo, we welcome the world and the “reform and open again” China's mutual benefit.
"For a country, openness is like breaking into a butterfly. Although it will experience a period of pain, it will be exchanged for a new life."
General Secretary Xi Jinping’s summary of the road to openness shows an important reason why “China can do it”.
Looking back on the 40 years of reform and opening up, China, which dared to enter the world market, has encountered whirlpools and storms, but has always faced all risk challenges with an open attitude, constantly releasing endogenous power and continuously improving its competitiveness.
It can be said that China has effectively explained the value and significance of openness with its own achievements.
Standing at a new historical starting point and holding an import-themed exposition, it is a major decision made by the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core to promote a new round of high-level opening up. It is a major initiative for China to open its market to the world. The move is China’s practical action to support economic globalization and trade liberalization, and demonstrates the strong and clear willingness that “the door to China’s openness will not be closed and will only grow wider”.
The participation of exhibitors from all over the world and the “one hard to find” booth is the biggest affirmation and best response to China's development of an open economy in a wider, broader and deeper level.
More importantly, the current global economic and trade order has reached a crossroads.
Some countries have built a high wall of trade protectionism and returned to the old path of unilateralism, increasing the international community’s worries about the prospects of free trade and adding uncertainty to the warming world economy.
In this era, the grand event on the banks of the Huangpu River reflects China's defense of free trade and allows the world to see China's self-confidence and China's responsibility to open up the market and share the future.
Lonely and fast, the public is far away.
China's open mind and embrace of the world have not only greatly promoted its own development, but also brought awkward "China opportunities" to countries and regions around the world.
In recent years, we have advocated and promoted the “One Belt and One Road”, initiated the establishment of the AIIB, and established the Silk Road Fund... China has provided a series of international public goods, providing real export markets, development opportunities and jobs for countries. Enterprises take the China Development "Express" and "Free ride".
The Expo is also such a public product and a platform for global economic and trade cooperation.
On this platform, more than 3,000 companies from more than 130 countries and regions have made their debut in the Chinese market with their distinctive quality products and services.
In addition to national enterprises, the real benefit is domestic consumers.
By building this “preferred and superior” platform, it provides multi-channel high-quality supply for consumption upgrades to meet the individualized, diversified and differentiated consumer needs of the people.
As China's open door grows bigger and bigger, goods flow smoothly and make the best use of it, and the pace of moving towards a better life will be more solid.
From a more macro perspective, the significance of the Expo has gone beyond the scope of economy and trade, but to the future, to convey the concept of openness, tolerance, inclusiveness, balance, and win-win, and to form a consensus to jointly address today's challenges.
The world is good, China can be good; China is good, the world is better.
We are looking forward to the world's wonderful and successful World Expo; we are even more embarrassed, moving towards a higher level of "open China" and the world to build a glorious future of the community of human destiny.
Foreign media: The United States and Canada reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
[Abstract] The agreement includes Canada opening its dairy market to the United States, and the United States temporarily does not impose tariffs on cars produced in Canada.
According to foreign media reports, a Canadian source revealed on the evening of September 30 that the United States and Canada had reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
According to reports, the agreement includes Canada opening its dairy market to the United States, and the United States temporarily does not impose tariffs on cars produced in Canada.
On the 27th of last month, the United States and Mexico announced a preliminary principle agreement on updating the North American Free Trade Agreement. However, the United States and Canada failed to reach an agreement before the August 31 deadline set by the US to extend the negotiation period to September 30. .
Earlier, a spokesman for Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland said that Canada would only sign a favorable agreement. "The focus is on the substance, not the timetable. We will continue consultations and hope to reach an agreement that is in the national interest of Canada."
Over 90% of Brazilian female voters said that the presidential candidate did not consider women's needs.
According to the South American Overseas Chinese News Network, the National Geographical Research Institute (IBGE) recently released data showing that more than 90% of Brazilian women do not think that the presidential candidate considers the needs of women.
According to the report, the number of women in Brazil has reached 107 million. If women from all over Brazil are brought together to form a country, the country's population will rank 13th in the world, and the number is more than twice the population of Spain.
In Brazil, the number of female voters accounts for 52% of the total number of voters, and men account for 48%. Although the proportion of women among voters is very high, the proportion of women in the Brazilian parliament is only 10%.
Among the 193 countries in the world, Brazilian women’s participation in politics ranks only 154th, higher than that of Arab countries.
After more than 20 years of rights struggle, Brazilian women still have not succeeded in obtaining their rights.
According to Brazilian sociologist Natalia Mori, this phenomenon exists because of the combined effects of ancient patriarchal society, racism, and capitalist values.
"Politics should be advocated by the people for civil rights, identity, access to public goods and the formation of the same society by multiple social groups. But the politics of Brazil belong to the monopoly of a certain group, and most of the population is not represented."
A previous study by the Locomotiva Institute of Brazil also pointed out that 94% of Brazilian women do not feel that the politicians elected by the election can represent their rights, and 90% of Brazilian women disagree with the decisions made by politicians. 93% of women disagree with the current government policy.
“We need to reverse the problem of underrepresentation of women in parliament. Brazil’s political system is still affected by inequality. So far, there has been serious gender, class and racial discrimination in the political sphere of Brazil.” Natalya・Mori said.
Despite the lack of women’s rights, most Brazilian women still believe in the power of democracy.
The survey shows that 76% of women think they can make a difference in democratic elections, and 72% of women are interested in politics.
In addition, 55% of women believe that democracy is the best way to expose women to less prejudice.

Although Barclays is optimistic about the prospects for the US economy before the end of the year, the bank acknowledges that it is more difficult to make predictions for further time.
“With the lack of more sustainable investment growth to boost economic growth potential, current fiscal policy-inspired growth will be unsustainable,” Barclays economists said in a research note.
“In the absence of investment growth, the risk of a hard landing in the economy in 2020 will rise,” they said.

The Eurozone and US manufacturing surveys, scheduled for release next Monday, will receive attention and a service industry survey will be released on Wednesday.
But the focus of next week's data will inevitably be the US non-farm payrolls data, which will be released next Friday, which will provide clues as to whether the tight job market is driving substantial growth in wages.
Its importance is not only important for its profitability and consumer purchasing power, but also because the salary jump or the rise in overall inflation may make the Federal Reserve Board (Fed) officials feel uneasy.
“Wage will be of great concern as it may rise sharply again from the previous month.
The increase in September may not exceed 3% in the same period of the previous year, but we can fully expect to break through next month,” Dutch International Group (ING) economists wrote in a research report.

[Abstract] After the ship is completed, it will be delivered to the East China Sea Branch of the State Oceanic Administration of China. Chen Hao, Director of the Observatory of the Marine Early Warning and Monitoring Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China, said that the ship will be put into use and will be used to develop China's offshore ocean observing system and promote the world. Ocean observations are of great significance.
On September 29th, China’s first 3,000-ton large-scale buoy ship “Xiangyanghong 22” was launched in the China Wuchuan Group.
After the ship is completed, it will break the bottleneck of equipment in China's large-scale buoys, submarine deployment, recycling, and repair work.
The "Xiangyanghong 22" wheel is mainly used for the regular inspection and maintenance of buoys/submersibles, regular deployment, recycling, buoy/submarine emergency deployment, recovery, repair and other safeguards, as well as the ability to perform comprehensive marine survey tasks such as cross-sectional surveys. .
The new ship has a total length of 89 meters, a width of 18 meters, a depth of 7.2 meters and a range of 10,000 nautical miles.
Wang Yuling, deputy general manager of Wuchuan Group, said: “Xiangyanghong 22 is the first large-scale buoy operation ship in China. It is also the only working ship with the ability to lift a 10-meter large buoy in China, which will further enhance the protection capability of China's large buoys.”
It is understood that the ship will be delivered to the East China Sea Branch of the State Oceanic Administration of China after being completed. Chen Hao, director of the Observatory of the Marine Early Warning and Monitoring Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China, said that the ship will be put into use and will be used to develop China's offshore ocean observing system and promote the world. Ocean observations are of great significance.
"This ship is equipped with large-scale buoys for maintenance work, and also has comprehensive marine survey capability. It is the first comprehensive ship in China dedicated to the operation of the COSCO sea buoy and integrated marine survey.
With such a buoy work boat, our ocean observation and ocean survey will have powerful tools in the future. ”
On the 1st of October, the new network Qingdao was affected by the typhoon “Tanmei”. The “Maze Run Cup”, the Qingdao Station of the 2018 International Extreme Sailing Series, which was scheduled to start on September 30, postponed the first match day to October. On the 1st, a pre-match meeting was held at the Qingdao Olympic Sailing Center before the competition. The captains of 12 hydrofoil catamaran teams from 6 countries and regions were all unveiled.
Under the influence of the typhoon "Tanmei", the strong wind in the harbor pool continued, the maximum wind speed was as high as 24 knots. The sailing signal was delayed by nearly 90 minutes from 1 pm on the 30th, and the wind speed was still not reduced. The referee of the event, Anne Mdland It was announced that the first day of the game will be cancelled and the game will be postponed until the afternoon of October 1.
“The strong winds blowing from the shore are constantly going on, and the sea conditions are really too strong.”
Mdrant explained: "Under such a situation, no one knows when the wind is blowing wind to the boat.
Close to the city's arena, in the current wind conditions, canceling the game is the most sensible choice. ”
It is still a bit disappointing for all the crew members who are ready.
"The regatta is ready to stop, and we are in good shape."
Qingdao team's helmsman Max Richardson said frankly: "But I know that the game rescheduled is the right choice, and I hope that today's wind energy is smaller, we can show our skills."
Omega Wilkinson, known as the "Star of Hope" of the New Zealand team at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, said: "The loss of a day has made the game more interesting.
Because today's game will increase in weight and there will be only two days left.
Everyone will be especially desperate. ”
Although the sea breeze is fierce, the French ABM's helmsman Pierre Ives Durand will meet before the game to appeal to his warm-hearted past with the venue of the competition: 5 years ago, the International Extreme Sailing Series was accidentally injured. Muscle fracture, thanks to the treatment of the local medical team, allowed me to stand in the competition venue five years later.
It is reported that the International Extreme Sailing Series was founded in 2007 and is the world's sailing competition with the Volvo, America's Cup, World Sailing Competition and other events.

Despite the volatility of the global financial market, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said on Monday that the Exchange Fund’s investment income in the third quarter of this year was down 97% year-on-year, but better than the previous quarter’s performance, as overseas stocks rose after the Sino-US trade war. Foreign exchange losses also narrowed significantly.
According to the latest data from the HKMA, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$1.6 billion in July-September 2018, which was significantly lower than the HK$61.8 billion in the same period last year, but better than the revised HK$100 million in the second quarter of this year.
The Chief Executive of the HKMA, Chen Delin, said in the Legislative Council that at the beginning of the Sino-US trade war, the Hong Kong and emerging market stock indices ran counter to the US stock index. After the US stock market index peaked at the end of September and early October, market sentiment began to reverse due to investors. It is gradually realized that the trade war is also detrimental to the United States itself.
“The change in market sentiment is a good thing. If the trade war has only a unilateral impact, it will not help much in solving the problem.”
However, he also pointed out that “if the Sino-US trade war is not resolved, financial market volatility will continue to rise.”
In the third quarter of this year, the exchange investment losses of the Exchange Fund in Hong Kong narrowed by 8% to HK$4.7 billion from the previous quarter. Overseas stock investment income increased by 172% to HK$12.8 billion. Foreign exchange losses were HK$16.2 billion and bond yields were HK$9.7 billion. , by 24% and 31% respectively, mainly reflecting the general rise of the US dollar against major currencies during the quarter and the US yield rate rising by 3% in mid-September.
The Exchange Fund is mainly used to support the Hong Kong dollar.
Since 1983, Hong Kong has implemented a linked exchange rate system in which the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the US dollar.
Regarding the current financial situation in Hong Kong, Chen Delin said that the economic and asset market uncertainty has increased and the downside risks have increased. However, Hong Kong's financial system is sound, and it is also well defensed and has sufficient seismic capacity.
"Hong Kong's international investment position is abundant. The net asset value of foreign capital is 1.4 trillion US dollars, which is four times the GDP, which is 2.5 times higher than Singapore's and 0.6 times that of Japan. It is enough to cope with the economic down cycle or reversal."
Recently, the Hong Kong dollar interest rate continued to fall and spread with the US dollar spread. Chen Delin pointed out that the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate has risen by more than 400 basis points on September 21. The market generally believes that it is mainly related to the increase in the Hong Kong dollar interest rate, and then the Hong Kong dollar against the US dollar is around 7.80-7.84. Alas, until recently, the Hong Kong dollar interest rate has continued to fall. The spread between the US dollar and the US dollar may increase the interest rate of the market, the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar. The chances of the Hong Kong dollar once again triggering the weak exchange guarantee are greater than the previous period.
However, he believes that as the Hong Kong bank's interest rate hike cycle begins and the Hong Kong dollar interest rate is normalized, the future Hong Kong dollar interest rate will be lower than the US dollar interest rate.
“The Hong Kong dollar interest rate and the US dollar interest rate trend will be more consistent. Everyone must be more careful in managing risks and be prepared to cope with market fluctuations.”
As Hong Kong dollar funds were abundant, the Hong Kong dollar interest rate fell further. The three-month interest rate fell 0.9% to 2.08179% on Monday, and the spread from the US dollar expanded from 46 basis points to 51 basis points. The one-month interest rate hit a five-month low. The difference is expanded from 120 basis points to 127 basis points.
From May to mid-September, the spot exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar was close to 7.85 against 1 US dollar.
During the period, due to factors such as carry-over activities and the outflow of funds from some of the IPOs after the completion of the large-scale IPO activities, the weak exchange guarantee was triggered several times in May and August after being triggered for the first time in April.
The HKMA bought Hong Kong dollars at the 7.85 level and pulled out the US dollar in accordance with the linked exchange rate system to maintain the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.
In May and August, the HKMA bought a total of approximately HK$52.1 billion under the weak exchange guarantee mechanism.
Does the new tax law have any concessions for foreigners?
The relevant person in charge of the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation said on the 30th that in order to maintain the stability of the policy, the next step in implementing the new personal income tax law will be to consider continuing to make preferential arrangements for foreigners, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
A reporter asked that the newly revised personal income tax law will adjust the judgment standard of China's personal income tax resident taxpayers from one year to 183 days.
May I ask if there are any preferential arrangements for foreigners, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, in implementing the law?
The person in charge responded that the current implementation of the Individual Income Tax Law has special preferential provisions for taxation of foreigners. Individuals who do not have a residence in China but have lived for less than one year and less than five years of income from China may only be from China. Part of the payment by domestic units or individuals is subject to personal income tax.
The person in charge said that in order to maintain the stability of the policy, the next step in implementing the new personal income tax law will be to consider continuing to make preferential arrangements for foreigners, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
There is no “threshold” month center: quality certification promotes quality.
With the "two-child economy" and the prosperity of the maternal and child market, from the north to the third- and fourth-tier cities, various places have emerged in various places.
The current hot month club meets the consumer demand of the masses. The fees range from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of yuan, but at the same time they are in an awkward position. There is no threshold for this institution, and there is still a blank space for supervision.
The State Administration of Markets has recently launched a series of national “Quality Month” activities in 2018. The reporter visited a five-star monthly sub-center in Tianjin to visit the maternal and child care service certification experience.
The general month center provides services such as neonatal care, nutritious meals, post-natal repair and shaping.
In this month's center, the reporter saw that nurses check the newborn's breastfeeding daily, and professional nurses provide bathing and touching services for newborns.
At the same time, in order to meet the needs of the new mother, from the beginning of the month of wound care, to the mid-late period of the body care and other services, provide Chinese medicine treatment and beauty care programs to help mothers restore their posture.
A new mother who lives in the office told the reporter that she had booked this month club eight months in advance.
The services of the Yuezi Club directly affect the comfort level and physical recovery during the maternal month. Some small-scale clubs can only provide some simple monthly services, which are not standardized, easy to cross-infect, and have a single diet. Unscientific and other problems.
The person in charge of this month center said that they are the only ones in Tianjin's five-star month center, and the only one has obtained the B-level service certification.
“Although some customers did not understand the meaning of B-level certification at first, it is of great significance to the long-term development of the company through certification, which forces the company to strictly standardize the process management,” he said.
Pan Lifen, deputy director of the Certification and Supervision Department of the State Administration of Markets, said that service certification is a new type of certification system based on customer perception, attention to organizational quality management and service characteristics, and is an important part of the national quality infrastructure. The proportion of supply and the enhancement of China's international competitiveness in service have a positive effect.
China started in 2004. After more than 10 years of development, the service certification project has undergone a process of development from scratch, and has emerged such as financial service certification, maternal and child care service certification, after-sales service certification, and e-commerce service certification. A number of influential service certifications such as health service certification.
According to statistics from the State Administration of Markets Supervision, there are currently more than 130 service certification agencies, more than 2,000 service certification personnel, and nearly 8,000 valid certification certificates.
Pan Lifen said that it is necessary to further guide and promote the development of service certification, and gradually expand the coverage of service certification in the fields of health, education, sports, finance, and e-commerce, and promote the supply-side reform and quality improvement of the service industry.
Reuters Hong Kong November 5 - Hong Kong property prices have fallen for two consecutive months after peaking. Hong Kong Monetary Authority President Chen Delin said on Monday that it is time for fashion to observe whether the property market has entered the down cycle. If confirmed, consider relaxing at an appropriate time. The tightening policy of countercyclical measures.
Mr Chan also pointed out that if property prices are adjusted back, the first to be affected will be those who bought their homes during the peak period of the property market. However, it is expected that property prices in the Asian financial turmoil in 1997 will fall sharply and the public will have a much lower chance of selling their properties. .
When Chen Delin led a number of senior executives of the HKMA to attend the Legislative Council briefing, he said that if the property market is confirmed to enter a down cycle, measures can be relaxed as appropriate.
"But at present, we only see data for a few weeks. It is still too early to relax. It still takes more time to see whether the property market is entering the down cycle."
Since the 10th of 2009, the HKMA has launched eight rounds of counter-cyclical measures to significantly tighten the mortgages of various properties, including reducing the number of mortgages and mortgage applicants to pass rigorous stress tests to enhance bank risk management. Earthquake resistance.
With Hong Kong officially entering the interest rate hike cycle, the private residential property price index in Hong Kong peaked for two consecutive months from August to September, and the monthly decline in September expanded to 1.44%.
However, the cumulative increase in the first three quarters of this year is still 10.2%.
According to the data of the HKMA, the financial situation of households measuring the seismic capacity of Hong Kong is still healthy. In the second quarter of this year, the proportion of households without mortgages in Hong Kong households reached 66%, which is 60% higher than the average of 2009-11. The average mortgage loan ratio and the newly approved mortgage-to-income ratios were 47% and 34%, respectively, which were significantly improved compared with 64% and 41% in 2009-11 respectively.
However, Chen Delin said that the high seismic capacity does not mean that the home buyers will not be harmed by the economic downturn, because the property valuation will fall, and those who buy buildings during the peak period will bear the brunt.
Although the HKMA has tightened bank lending to mortgage lenders, homebuyers can also obtain high-value mortgage loans through mortgage insurance or mortgage loans provided by developers.
Chen Delin said that with the mortgage loans provided to developers, the number of mortgage loans can reach 85-90%. If the property price falls by 10%, negative assets will appear (that is, the market value of the property will fall below the total amount of outstanding mortgage loans). s level) .
However, Mr. Yan Guoheng, vice president of the HKMA, pointed out that the authorities estimate that the total number of mortgages provided by developers is only 2-2.5% of the total bank mortgages, and the proportion is still low.
At the peak of negative equity in Hong Kong in 2003, the number of negative assets exceeded 100,000, accounting for 22% of the total number of people providing mortgages.
As of the third quarter of this year, Hong Kong recorded zero negative assets for the seventh consecutive quarter.

Zhongxin.com, Shenzhen, October 1st (Zheng Xiaohong, Xu Dianwei, Liu Yumeng) On October 1st, the first day of the "Golden Week" of the National Day of the Mainland, it was also the last day of the Hong Kong National Day public holiday. Many mainland residents used their holidays to travel abroad, shopping, and many more. The Hong Kong residents who came to Hong Kong returned to Hong Kong on the same day. The passenger flow in Shenzhen was exploding.

Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic and difficult disease involving multiple organs of the body. It used to be considered an "incurable disease".
Because its pathogenesis is unknown, diagnosis and treatment are difficult, and there is no effective treatment and no cure.
Recently, Liu Wanli, a researcher at the School of Life Sciences at Tsinghua University, and Li Zhanguo, director of the Rheumatology and Immunology Center at Peking University People's Hospital, discovered a molecular variant of human immunoglobulin that increases the susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus, and this mutation is involved in the regulation of immune B cells. .
In short, the two teams confirmed that an abnormal immune molecule in the human body is an important cause of the onset of systemic lupus erythematosus.
According to Sun Xiaolin, one of the authors of the article and Peking University People's Hospital, the team led by Li Zhanguo collected nearly 2,000 large samples of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and found that patients with immunoglobulin mutations produced pathogenic cells and a wide variety. The incidence and severity of inflammation, such as nephritis, arthritis, serositis, and vasculitis, are significantly increased.
Through various research methods such as immune cell tracing, animal testing, and sequencing, Liu Wanli team found that the immune molecule mutation activates the immune signaling pathway and promotes the pathogenic mechanism of B cells secreting various autoantibodies.
The reporter learned that the two teams have joined forces to give full play to their respective advantages and achieved a close integration between basic research and clinical application.
Liu Wanli team is committed to B lymphocyte immune recognition and immune activation research, and the Li Zhanguo team has long been engaged in clinical research on systemic lupus erythematosus.
"This research is one of the results of years of cooperation between the two teams. It is also the first time in the academic community to recognize that immunoglobulin gene abnormalities will induce systemic lupus erythematosus, which will lay a solid foundation for further academic research and clinical targeted therapy. Foundation."
This is not a short-term protection, but a matter of doing things according to law.
Does the lawyer carry the axe to the court?
The news was really exciting at first glance, and it also exploded in the legal circle.
China and France in Quanzhou, Fujian Province subsequently fined the lawyers for 500 yuan and proposed in writing to the Quanzhou Lawyers Association to investigate and deal with them.
According to the Beijing News, the Quanzhou Lawyers Association issued a formal notice that the actions of the two lawyers did not involve violations of laws and regulations and were not punished according to law.
Judging from the multi-party reports, the Quanzhou Lawyers' Association did not deal with short-term or confrontation, but was recognized by the Quanzhou Intermediate People's Court.
An event that could have caused tension within the legal community was eventually resolved.
The reversal of the matter stems from a more complete truth restoration: the axe carried by the lawyer involved is the same type and same model as the defendant's weapon, but it is not edged. It only serves as supporting evidence in the evidence-proven link, and there is no threatening act or “endangering”. Subjective intent of court security.
Judging whether the behavior of the lawyer involved is illegal or not, there are four very important details to be concerned: First, the local court has twice opened the court and only showed a photo of the axe. From the perspective of defense, it is necessary to show the original of the axe; Second, the axe is purchased one hour before the trial. It is not that the lawyer is not willing to seek the judge's consent, but the objective is not able to contact the judge; third, the entire axe has not been used excessively or improperly; The lawyer publicly admitted the mistake and immediately apologized to the court.
Based on these plots, it can be seen that the lawyers who have "take axe in court" have nothing to do, just to defend.
After clarifying the whole facts, the Quanzhou Lawyers Association did not push the boat, but withstood the pressure to make a decision not to be punished.
And this decision can withstand the test of facts and laws.
As for the axe that controls the knives to the court without the permission of the court, it is easy to cause anxiety and misunderstanding.
For the sake of safety and prudence, Quanzhou Intermediate People’s Court’s previous fines and judicial advice are also understandable.
In order to safeguard the dignity of lawyers and prevent individual courts from borrowing lawyers, the Supreme Law promulgated the "People's Court Judicial Police Safety Inspection Rules" in 2014, and established the principle that lawyers do not need to conduct personal safety inspections in court.
Since the issuance of the rule, the majority of lawyers have set an example by example, and there have been few incidents of security breaches due to security loopholes.
In very rare cases like Quanzhou, misunderstandings are not difficult to eliminate as long as they communicate in a spirit of mutual respect and understanding.
As a self-discipline organization in the legal profession, the Bar Association bears the dual mission of disciplining against law and ensuring legality.
In the past, individual law organizations have been blamed for their emphasis on disciplinary action and their loss of protection.
The decision of the Quanzhou Lawyers Association is worthy of praise, both in terms of process and results, and sets an example for more law firms to perform their duties correctly.
From October 1st, which tax benefits will affect our money bag?
Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 1st (Reporter Mulberry) The new personal income tax law will be implemented on January 1, 2019. In order to allow the masses to enjoy the tax reduction dividend as soon as possible, from October 1st, the tax will be paid first. The wages and salaries actually obtained by the person are deducted at the threshold of 5,000 yuan per month, and the new tax rate table is applied.
With the arrival of the New Deal, what are the benefits that will affect the money bag of the masses?
Good one: the tax deduction for wages and salaries is obvious
Taxpayers who have obtained wages and salaries after October 1st can deduct the basic deduction of 5,000 yuan/month and apply the new tax rate table. Most taxpayers have different levels of tax reduction, especially for low- and middle-income people. It is obvious.
According to the tax reduction table of different income groups, the person who deducts the “three insurances and one gold” monthly income of 8,000 yuan, 10,000 yuan, 20,000 yuan, 50,000 yuan, the taxable amount after tax reform is 90 yuan, 290 yuan respectively. 1,590 yuan, 9090 yuan, compared with the monthly threshold of 3,500 yuan, the corresponding tax reduction ratio is 73.9%, 61.1%, 49.0%, 18.8%.
It is worth noting that due to holidays, the new basic deductions and tax rates can be applied to the wages that should be issued by the units in October at the end of September.
To this end, the withholding client software that is uniformly promoted by the taxation department has provided the corresponding tax calculation function, but the corresponding tax still needs to be declared and paid during the statutory reporting period.
Good two: the low tax rate is significantly larger
In addition to raising the threshold, the new tax rate table will apply from October 1.
The seven-rate tax rate of wages and salaries received the same as before, but there has been no change, but the tax rate has changed significantly.

The Okinawa Governors’ election, which was carried out in advance by the former Governor Weng Changxiong’s illness, announced the results in the early morning of the 1st local time, and Yucheng Danny, who opposed the relocation plan of the US military base in Japan, was successfully elected.

Since the mid-2000s, as China's demand for oilseeds has grown, North Dakota farmer Paul Thomas has grown more and more soybeans in his field.
This shift peaked this year, and he planted 1,600 acres of soybeans on 5,000 acres, a scale never seen before.
But Thomas and many other farmers like him plan to switch to the staple crops of the former US agricultural region in 2019: corn and wheat.
American farmers have surpassed corn this year for the first time in 35 years.
The reason for the plan to switch to other food crops is because American farmers are facing difficulties in selling soybeans in the context of US President Trump’s trade war with China.
China usually buys about 60% of US exports of soybeans, but because of the trade war, almost zero purchases of US soybeans in recent months have caused soybean prices to fall to a 10-year low.
Thomas plans to plant more wheat next year, hoping to make more money by reducing dependence on crops that depend on China's needs.
Thomas said that soybean prices "have brought us a deep blow."
He said that without China's buying demand, the spot price of soybeans near its farm is $7.10 per bushel, and the price necessary to cover costs is $8.50.
US farmers have set a record high soybean area this year, and the harvest is also expected to hit a record high.
At such a time when it was very vulnerable, they encountered a blow to the trade war.
In response to Trump's tariff on imported Chinese goods, China imposed import tariffs on imported US soybeans in July.
The US Department of Agriculture will release its first estimate of the area planted next year, which is expected to include consideration of tariff effects.
The estimate is expected to confirm the expectations of private institutions for a reduction in soybean acreage.
According to a report seen by Reuters, Informa Economics estimated on October 19 that corn plantings will increase by 4% to 92.7 million acres (37.5 million hectares) in 2019, and soybean acreage will be reduced by 7% to 83 million acres.
Informa also expects US wheat acreage to increase by 4%.
The area of soybeans grown before the implementation of retaliatory tariffs rose to 89.6 million acres this year, about 15 million acres higher than 10 years ago.
Corn acreage has increased by less than 5 million acres since 2008 to 89.1 million acres, and this year's wheat acreage is 47.8 million acres, close to the lowest level in 100 years.
Aron Carlson, president of the Illinois Corn Plantation Association, has a total planting area of 3,600 acres, and nearly half of it is used to grow soybeans this year, but plans to cut back in the future.
He said he may increase corn acreage by up to 20% on his farm in northern Illinois; the state is the largest soybean-growing state in the United States.
Soybeans yield less than corn per acre, but require less fertilizer, which makes soybeans generally less costly to grow.
If the farmer moves to the final value of corn, it may increase costs, but will benefit some companies including Andersons Inc fertilizer sellers.
Andersons CEO Pat Bowe told Reuters that he expected the conversion of corn would be beneficial to fertilizer use.
Bayer is also expected to benefit from the conversion of farmers to corn.

Xinhua International Time Review: Defending multilateralism, China's know-how and unity.
At the moment when unilateralism is surging, international rules and multilateral order have been hit.
To some extent, the confrontation between unilateralism and multilateralism has entered a critical period.
As a responsible big country, China has taken the idea of a prosperous and harmonious road and a solid and powerful action to work with the international community to safeguard multilateralism and promote multilateralism.
Facing the new situation and new challenges, China has made a loud voice on the direction and path of multilateralism.
Just as State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in the speech of the general debate of the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly, multilateralism in the new era should adhere to the goal of cooperation and win-win, based on the rule order, and on the basis of fairness and justice. Action-oriented.
At the same time, China calls for the establishment of a global development cooperation pattern centered on the United Nations as the core, South-North cooperation as the main channel and South-South cooperation, and calls on all parties to work together to build a community of human destiny.
China’s thinking and voice reflect the mainstream voice of the international community.
As the President of the 73rd UN General Assembly Espinosa said, under the current situation, "the United Nations needs to promote multilateralism and maintain a rules-based international system more than ever."
International Monetary Fund President Lagarde said that the international community should continue to firmly uphold the multilateral trading system, adhere to international trade rules, and resolve differences through consultation.
In recent years, with the adjustment of the balance of global economic and political forces, some emerging markets and developing countries have emerged, playing a greater role in the major international multilateral mechanisms, and providing new development impetus for the multilateralism facing the headwinds.
Standing in this dimension, China advocates building a big family instead of putting together a small circle, insisting on multilateralism, such as co-construction rather than win-winning, and conforming to the trend of the times, is the inevitable choice to cope with global challenges and solve world problems. Represents the common aspirations of most countries in the world.
Have advanced ideas and more solid actions.
China’s “One Belt, One Road” initiative has become the largest international cooperation platform.
China initiated the establishment of “One Belt and One Road”, Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, “16+1 Cooperation” and other international and regional cooperation initiatives to promote international cooperation, improve existing international systems and order, and bring innovation vitality to multilateral cooperation. To contribute to the development of the international order in a more just and rational direction.
As the defender of the international order and the practitioner of multilateralism, China’s actions are becoming more and more powerful in the multilateral arena of the United Nations.
Align international hotspots, deal with climate change, participate in peacekeeping operations, vigorously reduce poverty and help the poor, and help other countries implement the 2030 sustainable development agenda.
As UN Secretary-General Guterres said, China has become an important pillar of multilateralism.
When the “trust deficit” facing the world intensifies, when populism and polarization are on the rise, it is the moment when the world’s demand for multilateral cooperation is most urgent.
At such a historical juncture, the international community needs to join hands to turn consensus into action, resolutely defend multilateralism, and jointly promote the building of a community of human destiny.

Reuters, Beijing, September 30 - China's central bank announced on Monday that foreign currency assets are scheduled to net short-term outflows. As of the end of August this year, the central bank's foreign currency short positions on local currency forward contracts and futures contracts were zero for 12 consecutive months, and there were still no longs in the month.

On the evening of September 20 this year, on the K158 train, Joe, who was a junior in Zhengzhou, took a bus to Hebi.
A grandfather on the train bought a seatless ticket, but it took up her seat: "Come and shoot it."
After two hours of driving, the train conductor advised him that it was still invalid for an hour.
In the end, a male passenger in the same carriage could not stand up and picked up the grandfather.
From the sensational point of view, although the final result is mostly that the tyrants are condemned by the public, administratively punished by the public security department, and even included in the blacklist of integrity, the public still feels that it does not “redress”: Why can't the tyrants be punished on the spot?
Why can't you stop immoral or even illegal behavior on the spot, but can only punish it afterwards?
And for the unreasonable behavior of "the overlord", how can a male passenger pick up the "unsatisfactory road"?
The main reason is that only long-distance trains are equipped with passenger police, and short-distance trains generally do not; even if there is a policeman, the passengers are more concerned about the possible rogue reaction of the occupants and do not take compulsory removal measures.
Repeated hegemonic events have made people realize that it is necessary to let the squadron be forced to take away or even be punished on the spot.
This requires that our train passengers should dare to take strong measures in a timely manner. Trains that do not have police should deploy passengers as soon as possible to preserve and prevent illegal activities in a timely manner.

The three points of the road start, middle and tail to implement segmentation control on the vehicle, and remind all passing drivers to open the road on one side and make the wrong vehicle for the ambulance.

To activate rural consumption, it is necessary to rely on the normalization mechanism to purify the market, guide the demand for healthy consumption, and enhance the sense of gain in farmers' consumption.
The data shows that the consumption potential of rural residents has been continuously released. In the first half of this year, the retail sales of rural consumer goods increased by 10.5%, and the growth rate was 1.3 percentage points higher than that of cities and towns.
In a poor village in a county in the west, there is only one convenience store in the village. When I walk into the store, some goods seem to have met each other. The “Arowana” is labeled as “Golden Dragon Oil” and “Wangzi” has become “Wang Milk” and “Mountain”. A lot of goods.
Over the years, similar phenomena have been frequently exposed. Some rural counterfeit goods are famous brands, their names are similar, their packaging is similar, and they are fake and unpredictable.
A consumer survey report released by a city in the west shows that rural supermarkets have a serious problem of over-counterfeiting, and 66% of users have bought fakes in supermarkets under the township line, of which food accounts for more than half.
The relevant departments have rectified the rural market and shouted every year. Why is the "Li Gui" still incessant?
Different from the urban market, farmers' awareness of rights protection is relatively weak, and many rural areas are remote, and they are in a blind spot where supervision power is not enough, so that fake and inferior goods have a breeding ground.
A commodity multi-head tube, some departments control the price, some tube production, some tube market, function cross, annual anti-counterfeiting, centralized management of a gust of wind, fakes escaped the limelight, and slowly emerged, just finished the old holiday The new holiday came out again.
Lack of long-term supervision mechanism, the rural market is difficult to purify, the illegal cost is low, and the interests are large. As a result, some unscrupulous traders have mobilized the brains of “going to the countryside and going to the countryside”, and some rural areas have become “disinfection markets”.
From food and clothing to well-off, the majority of farmers are moving towards developmental consumption.
A few days ago, the Party Central Committee and the State Council issued the "Several Opinions on Improving the Mechanism of Promoting the Consumption System to Further Encourage the Consumption Potential of Residents", which proposed to promote the upgrading of the consumption of rural residents. The purpose is to enable the majority of farmers to "consume", "willing to consume" and "dare to consume". Let rural consumption really flourish.
On the one hand, it is necessary to deepen reforms, eliminate market management and multiple administrative and multi-faceted management malpractices, adapt to local conditions, improve food safety and product quality supervision networks, and continuously reduce the space for rural counterfeiting and selling fakes.
On the other hand, it is necessary to step up law enforcement and open up the supervision of “capillary blood vessels”, and never allow counterfeiting and counterfeiting to breed in the countryside.
Strictly punishing the peasants is the protection of the peasants. No matter how concealed the counterfeiters are, they should not be the reason for the breeding of counterfeit and inferior goods. The relevant departments should clarify their responsibilities, and the grassroots supervisory forces should sink, and in which links, problems must be investigated. Let the counterfeiters and sellers have nowhere to hide.
Strictly restrict market access, implement strict qualification examinations for production and business operators, keep the market circulation, let products come to the road, go to the road, find ways from the source and roots, let the legal dealers operate with peace of mind, let the farmers buy rest assured.
To activate rural consumption, we must guide healthy consumer demand.
With the upgrading of consumption, many farmers not only pursue full food, eat well, but also pursue high-quality life such as culture and health. They cannot equate the rural market with “low quality” and “cheap” paintings.
This needs to promote the extension of e-commerce to the vast rural areas, smooth the urban and rural two-way linkage sales channels, promote the combination of offline industry development platform and online e-commerce trading platform, support the new mode of new consumption business to expand into the rural market; promote qualified townships and towns Trade logistics and leisure agriculture, rural tourism, product processing and other organic integration; improve the rural modern circulation network system, optimize the integration of stock facilities resources, and effectively reduce rural circulation costs.
To create a clear and reassuring market environment for the rural areas, so that farmers can not consume enough, rural consumption can become more and more prosperous, in order to enhance the sense of peasant consumption and happiness.

At the same time, with the overall tariff level, especially the reduction of import tariffs on pharmaceuticals and consumer goods, the tax rate for import duties on imported goods is lowered accordingly.
In order to implement the decision-making arrangements of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, China has implemented zero tariffs on most imported drugs since May 1 this year, and reduced import tariffs on automobiles, parts and components, and some daily consumer goods since July 1. The implementation of the information technology agreement to expand the product third step tax reduction.
The reporter learned from the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council that since this year, after repeated independent adjustments, the total tariff level of China will be reduced from 9.8% in the previous year to 7.5 percent, with an average decline of 23%.
Appropriate reduction of tariffs is conducive to promoting the balanced development of foreign trade and promoting a higher level of opening up to the outside world. It is also conducive to the overall utilization of both domestic and international resources and the promotion of domestic supply-side structural reforms.
The relevant person in charge of the committee said that this year is the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up. Actively lowering the overall level of tariffs is the actual action of the incumbent General Secretary of the General Secretary of the People’s Republic of China in the spirit of the important speech of the Boao Forum for Asia. It is also the need for China to further expand its openness and actively expand imports according to its own high-quality development needs. The important measures, this action and measures show that China will unswervingly pursue an open strategy of mutual benefit and win-win, and while enhancing its own development momentum, it will also allow China to develop better and benefit the world.

Huan County is located at the junction of Shaanxi, Gansu and Ningxia provinces. It is known as the “National Grain Production Advanced County”, “China's Small Miscellaneous Grain Town” and “China's Shadow Town”. It has a long history and rich resources.
Local snacks such as lamb meat, yellow rice wine, noodles, and soft noodles are the flavors that are often remembered by wanderers in other countries.
As China's urbanization level continues to increase, the urban population is rapidly increasing, and a large number of rural young people leave their hometowns to start urban life.
Yang Qiaojia, an expert on agricultural brand research in China, said: “Currently, urban life is fast-paced and stressful. More and more people are beginning to miss the rural life when they were young. However, 'the most beautiful memory is the country’, 'the ring’ The township's brand design is named after the nostalgia and homesickness of the Huanhuan County.
The climate conditions in Huan County are special, the sunshine time is long, the temperature difference between day and night is large, and the conditions for planting special small grains are unique.
There are more than 20 kinds of small grains in the territory. It is the hometown of China's small grains, and its output ranks first in Gansu, and its quality is in the forefront of the country.
Wang Xiaoli is a girl from Huan County who went to school in Tianjin. She participated in the promotion meeting as a volunteer. She said: “The people in my hometown are the most dear, and the taste of the hometown is the most beautiful. The brand of “Huanxiang people” has brought us too many nostalgia and memories. What I have never forgotten is the food at that time. I hope that the brand of 'Huanxiang people' will go further and further and become bigger and bigger."
Dr. Tan Bin, a researcher at the National Institute of Food and Material Reserves, said that through the detection of more than 900 sets of indicators, the detection data of agricultural products such as buckwheat, bitter buckwheat and black beans in Huan County are outstanding, and many physiologically active substances in miscellaneous grains are high. According to the standard data, “Huanxiangren” has the inherent advantage of seizing the domestic high-end miscellaneous grains market.
Chai Chun, secretary of the county party committee of the county, said that through the release of the “Circle of the Township” brand, it can further improve the quality, standardization and scale of innovation and development of quality agricultural products in Huan County, which is conducive to shaping the overall image of the agricultural products in Huan County and rapidly increasing its popularity.

Canada's gross domestic product (GDP) in July rose 0.2% from the previous month, a higher-than-expected increase, which caused the market to heat up expectations that the Bank of Canada will raise interest rates next month.
If it really raises interest rates, it will be the fifth time the central bank raises interest rates in a little over a year.
Analysts interviewed by Reuters had previously forecast a 0.1% increase.
Statistics Canada said on Friday that 12 of the 20 industries achieved growth.
The reason for the data is worth noting because the central bank predicted earlier this month that temporary factors may drag down third-quarter GDP data.
Bank of Canada President Poloz promised on Thursday that the central bank will continue to raise interest rates gradually and will pay close attention to economic data.
The next time the Bank of Canada announces its interest rate decision will be on October 24.
The Bank of Canada has raised interest rates four times since July 2017, as Canada's economy has grown and the unemployment rate has been close to record lows.
Stephen Brown, a senior Canadian economist at Kaitou, said that the country’s third-quarter GDP growth rate is expected to reach around 2%.
“This will be higher than the 1.5% expected by the Bank of Canada and will therefore be another reason to expect the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates next month,” he said in a report.
The overnight index swap showed that the market's estimate of the Bank of Canada's interest rate hike in October rose from 76.46% to 78.27%.
Han Dynasty’s first joint inspection of the Han River estuary in 65 years
The South Korean Ministry of National Defense confirmed on the 5th that the Korean side initiated a joint investigation on the waters of the Han River and the Imjin River.
The move is to prepare for the free navigation of private vessels on both sides.
The Korean Ministry of National Defense’s briefing to the media on the same day showed that this was the first joint investigation of the Han River estuary since the signing of the Korean War Armistice Agreement in 1953.
The South Korean government signed a military agreement in September this year and agreed to jointly investigate the waters such as the Han River estuary in November to ensure environmental protection and development tourism for the waters in the future.
In October, the South Korean and Korean dynasties planned the joint investigation of waters in the general meeting.
On November 5th, the joint investigation of the Korean and Korean waters was officially launched.
The joint study group consists of 20 people including the Korean military and experts.
According to the South Korean Ministry of National Defense, during the inspection, both sides did not carry weapons, and it was forbidden to use words and deeds that stimulated each other.
“Because there is no military demarcation line near the estuary, the area was an unexpectedly high-rise area, but through joint investigations, it will become a new peaceful section in the future.”
The waters of the joint investigation of the ROK and the DPRK have a total length of about 70 kilometers and a total area of about 280 square kilometers.
According to the Korean Ministry of National Defense, the South Korean side will send six inspection vessels to detect the depth of the sea, etc., to provide basic information for the safe navigation of the waters; after the investigation is completed, navigation maps will be provided for the private vessels.
