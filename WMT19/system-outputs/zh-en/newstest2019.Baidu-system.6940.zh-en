According to the British media, Admiral William Moran, Deputy Secretary of Naval Operations of the United States, said that even as the United States Navy is reinvigorating its strength to deal with the increasingly worrying Russia on both sides of the Atlantic, the United States continues to make the Asia-Pacific region - the Pentagon has expanded the scope of the region to include the Indian Ocean-Asia-Pacific - the focus of the Navy.
According to a report on the website of Jane's Defense Weekly on September 24, the United States listed China and Russia as strategic competitors in the new national defense strategy announced at the beginning of the year.
Since then, the US Navy has restored the Second Fleet in order to confront Russia's activities more directly.
According to the report, these moves have raised some questions and concerns among allies and analysts, who are concerned that the US Navy may stay away from the "Asia-Pacific rebalancing" strategy that marks the Obama administration.
But Admiral Moran said that the focus of the US Navy is still on the Western Pacific.
"For us, no major changes have taken place," he said at a round-table discussion entitled "Meeting the challenges of the high seas," hosted by the US National Bureau of Asian Research in Washington on January 24, 2018.
"The focus is still on rebalancing, shifting the center of gravity or whatever you want to describe it," Moran said.
However, he acknowledged that the United States has close ties with Europe.
"We will continue to focus on the growth of the West Coast and balance what we can do," he said.
Although Moran pointed out that the overall policy on Russia falls under the purview of the US Secretary of Defense, he warned: "The Russians may face demographic and economic challenges, but history proves that if we clash with them, they will be very tough."
Admiral Moran said that as part of the US comeback operation against Russia, China and other competitors, the US Navy is dynamically deploying its troops into a "new operational mode," which will help to catch the adversary unprepared as to where the US aircraft carrier battle group or other assets will be deployed at any given time and place.
"Our Navy and Marine Corps support it - the concept of operational unpredictability, do not appear in the same place again and again, almost like clockwork - this is our approach," he said.
According to the report, the first to try this new approach was the aircraft carrier battle group "Harry Truman," whose early deployment included working visits to the port and patrolling in areas usually only passing through.
Moran said that at present, the U.S. Navy is working to ensure that its allies know that these warships will still patrol the traditional areas, and is also addressing logistical and family liaison issues for the new deployment procedures.
The Commander of the Royal Australian Navy, Lieutenant General Michael Noonan, also spoke at the event, saying that the Australian army can work seamlessly with the aircraft carrier battle group of the United States.
He said that this situation will continue as the Royal Australian Navy plans to purchase nine more frigates equipped with the "Zeus Shield" combat system.
From October 5, a number of airlines will increase or resume the fuel surcharge. From next Friday, more money will be required for air travel
Yesterday, Xiangpeng Airlines, Okai Airlines and other airlines announced that starting from October 5, 2018 (the date of issue of tickets), the fuel surcharge on domestic routes will be 20 yuan for each passenger on routes below 800 km (including), and 30 yuan for each passenger on routes above 800 km.
Xiangpeng Airlines, Okai Airlines and other companies announced that starting from 0: 00 on October 5, 2018 (the date of issue of tickets), the fuel surcharge rate for domestic routes under 800 km (including) has increased from 10 yuan per person to 20 yuan per person, and the fuel surcharge rate for domestic routes over 800 km has increased from 10 yuan per person to 30 yuan per person per passenger.
Children and disabled members of the military and police are all 10 yuan per person; infants continue to be exempted.
According to the person-in-charge of the Ctrip ticket, the airline has indicated in the notice that the collection of fuel surcharge is based on the original date of issue, and the fuel surcharge is non-refundable and non-refundable when the passenger ticket is replaced.
This means that if the domestic airline tickets issued before October 5 are to be changed to October 5 (inclusive), there is no need to pay the fuel surcharge according to the new standard.
Since June 5, 2018, a number of airlines, including Air China, China Eastern Airlines, Air China, Shanghai Airlines, Spring and Autumn Airlines, Shenzhen Airlines, Western Airlines and Okai Airlines, have resumed the collection of fuel surcharges on domestic routes that have been cancelled for three years, with a standard of 10 yuan per person.
This time, Xiangpeng Airlines and Okai Airlines were the first to announce the increase of fuel surcharge. As of the press release, they have not seen the news that the four major domestic airlines have announced the follow-up adjustment.
It is also understood that the Hong Kong Civil Aviation Department has stipulated that airlines can decide on their own whether to charge fuel surcharge from November.
Cathay Pacific first announced on September 27 that it would start to collect the fuel surcharge on November 2.
According to the Cathay Pacific website, all tickets issued or re-issued by Cathay Pacific and Cathay Pacific Dragonair on or after November 2 will include fuel surcharge. For long-haul flights to and from Hong Kong and the South-West Pacific, North America, Europe, the Middle East and India, and Africa, the fuel surcharge is $652 and for short-haul flights, $146.
The fee is applicable to all kinds of tickets, calculated according to each flight segment, and includes ticket quotations in all direct sales channels of Cathay Pacific.

Japan's Itozhong Commercial Company on Friday recognized an impairment loss of $1.3 billion in its investment in China's Citic shares and wrote down its largest enterprise investment transaction due to the impact of trade tensions between China and the United States.
In May 2016, a man walks past the headquarters of Maruhong Co., Ltd., in Tokyo, Japan.
Maruhong said that the trade war had hit its US grain department, Gao Hong, and that it had suspended its financial transactions in agriculture.
Previously, some Japanese heavy equipment manufacturers, telecommunications companies and others had warned about the impact of Sino-US trade friction when they announced their latest results, and now these Japanese trade associations have joined the ranks.
The United States and China have imposed tariffs on each other's hundreds of billions of dollars of goods, and US President Donald Trump has threatened to expand the scope of the tax to all over US $500 billion of Chinese goods exported to the United States if the dispute cannot be resolved.
Tsuyoshi Hachimura, commercial finance minister of Itozhong, said that trade disputes may have a greater impact on China's economy next year.
Itozhong Commercial and Thai Bu Bee Group invested US $10 billion in CITIC in 2015 and obtained a 20% stake in it.
Hachimura said that Itozhong Commercial listed 143.3 billion yen (US $1.3 billion) in losses on this part of its shares because it believed that Citic's share price would not recover in the near future.
Itozhong maintained its profit forecast of 500 billion yen for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019.
In July, China imposed a 25% import tariff on US soybeans to counter Washington's moves in trade friction.
"Our grain business has been hit by the trade friction between the United States and China," said Yanhong, Maruhong's finance minister.
He said that Gao Hung had stopped the financial transactions of his own account since September.
In a draft statement Friday, Kaohong spokesman Pat Burke pointed out that the company's move was "in accordance with internal policy restrictions and due to the lack of market opportunities."
He also said that the suspension of financial transactions will not lead to the reduction of jobs.
Maruhong maintained its annual profit estimate of 230 billion yen and was helped by pulp and paper and power generation business.
On Thursday, Sumitomo Commercial reported a 16% increase in profits between April and September, stressing that "the trade problems between the United States and China have led to an uncertain future."
Mitsubishi Commercial raised its annual profit estimate to a record level on Friday, due to the increase in coking coal production and the rise in the prices of commodities such as oil and coal.
Mitsubishi Commercial also announced a new business plan, aiming to increase its profit to 900 billion yen (US $7.98 billion) in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022 from the estimated 640 billion yen this year.
According to a comprehensive report on November 5, the voting in the US mid-term election has entered the countdown.
On November 4, President Trump and his Democratic rivals actively "urged votes" to their core voters.
Both major parties pointed out that voter turnout will be the key to influence the election situation.
It is reported that in the 48 hours before the American popular vote, Trump was busy attending the setting of the Republican candidate, while former President Barack Obama went to Indiana for the platform of Joe Donnelly, the Democratic Federal Senate candidate who was in a hurry, and called out the final pre-election appeal to the crowd.
On November 4, Trump went to Megang, Georgia, for the platform of Brian Kemp, the Republican gubernatorial candidate, and said, "You have to go to the voting booth on Tuesday, you have to vote."
"The contrast in this election could not have been clearer."
The political enthusiasm of voters has risen to a rare peak, and early voting in some states has been far more than usual.
Every president of the United States faces the first mid-term election, and the number of members of Congress of his party tends to decrease.
According to a new poll released by the Washington Post and ABC News on Thursday, while the Democratic race for the Federal House of Representatives remains dominant, Republicans can benefit from economic assessment and Trump's strict focus on border security.
According to the poll, registered voters like more Democratic House candidates than Republicans, the ratio is 50% to 43%, but it is still down from the 14-point lead in August.
Another poll conducted by NBC and the Wall Street Journal also showed that Democrats still lead Republicans by 7 percentage points.
It is reported that Obama told the crowd on the occasion of Senator Donoli's campaign: "When people do not tell the truth, when words no longer represent anything, it is bound to have bad results.
When people can only lie to themselves, democracy will not work, "he said.
"The only way to stop the behavior of these Republicans now is you and your vote."
Democrats face the most difficult election in the Senate in decades, and Republicans now hold more than half of the 51 seats.
However, the election of the House of Representatives is more favorable, and the Democrats need to win another 23 seats to control the 435-seat House of Representatives.
According to analysts of the forecasting website FiveThirtyEight.com, the probability of the Democratic Party winning the House of Representatives is as high as 85%.

The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) held an important ideological and theoretical seminar of General Secretary Xi Jinping on strengthening and improving the work of the CPPCC in Beijing from 29 to 30.
Wang Yang, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, attended the meeting and made a speech.
He stressed that General Secretary Xi Jinping's important thought on strengthening and improving the work of the People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) has profoundly clarified the status role, target task, duty mission and practical requirements of the CPPCC, and scientifically answered a series of major directional, overall and strategic questions, which is a powerful ideological weapon to guide the work of the CPPCC in the new era.
We should earnestly study and implement this important thought, grasp its great significance, rich connotation and spiritual essence, make real efforts to learn, understand and do practical work, promote the quality of the work of the CPPCC with theoretical study and ideological armed forces, and earnestly shoulder the new mission of the CPPCC in the new era.
From September 29 to 30, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) held in Beijing an important ideological and theoretical seminar of General Secretary Xi Jinping on strengthening and improving the work of the CPPCC.
Wang Yang pointed out that since the 18th National Congress of the CPC, General Secretary Xi Jinping has put forward a series of new ideas and new opinions on strengthening and improving the work of the CPPCC, and proposed for the first time that the CPPCC is an important channel and special consultative body for socialist consultation and democracy. Is an important part of the national governance system, is an institutional arrangement with Chinese characteristics, to clarify the characteristics and advantages of the new political party system for the first time, emphasizing the correct handling of the relationship between consistency and diversity, it has deeply revealed that the true meaning of people's democracy lies in having things to discuss and people's affairs to be discussed by all. It reveals the logical connection between the "rule of China" and China's political system, condenses the profound theoretical thinking of adhering to and developing the system of the People's Political Consultative Conference, and is the latest achievement of the Party's theory of the People's Political Consultative Conference.
Wang Yang stressed that the CPPCC at all levels should take the theoretical study and discussion as an opportunity to further find the weak links and shortcomings in the work of the CPPCC, and work hard to strengthen and improve it and seek breakthroughs.
It is necessary to strengthen the Party building of the CPPCC system in an all-round way and ensure that the decision-making and deployment of the CPC Central Committee is fully implemented into the work of the CPPCC.
It is necessary to strengthen ideological and political leadership, improve the system, procedures and mechanism of "two-way force" in the construction of advice, management and consensus-building, and implement ideological and political leadership into all aspects and the whole process of the performance of duties.
We should focus on the central task and fulfill our duties, better obey the overall situation of the Party and the country, improve the quality of construction and management, and enhance the effectiveness of the performance of our duties.
It is necessary to strengthen the self-construction of the CPPCC, pay close attention to the education and training of its members and cadres, give full play to the basic role of the special committees and strengthen the foundation for the CPPCC to perform its functions.
It is necessary to strengthen guidance to the work of the local CPPCC, give directions, make demonstrations and solve difficult problems, so as to raise the overall level of the work of the CPPCC.

A total of 793,800 CPPCC members and 279,000 government cadres at all levels participated in the study and discussion, resulting in more than 36,000 research papers.
People's Network Beijing, November 5 (Wang Xiaoyan) Under the current wave of "mass entrepreneurship and innovation," more and more technology companies have begun to attach importance to patent research and development and related protection work, dig deep into the potential value of patents and occupy the leading position in the market.
Similarly, many scientific and technological enterprises have encountered considerable tort waves in the licensing of patented technology and the use of patented technology.
At the end of 2017, Tan Wei, He Zhanghong and Lai Bin from Guangdong Province sued the developer of the "drip travel" APP, Beijing Xiaoorange Technology Co., Ltd. (Hereinafter referred to as "small orange technology"), the operator drip travel technology Co., Ltd. (Hereinafter referred to as "drip travel") and the seller, Guangdong Pacific Internet Information Service Co., Ltd. (Hereinafter referred to as "Guangdong Pacific"), to the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court on the grounds of patent infringement.
The three plaintiffs requested the court to order that the three defendants immediately stop manufacturing, selling, promising to sell and using the plaintiff's patent.
On October 30, 2018, the China Referees' Correspondence Network published the "first-instance civil adjudication of disputes over infringement of invention patent rights between Tan Wei, He Zhanghong and Beijing Xiaoorange Science and Technology Co., Ltd.," revealing some details of the cases in which the drip travel APP was sued for patent infringement.
The three plaintiffs believe that the patentee and inventor of the patent of "carpool service system and method based on mobile terminal," and that the whole operation process of the application of "downwind vehicle" in the "drip travel" APP corresponds to the technical scheme of the patent protection involved, which constitutes a patent infringement.
However, during the court ruling, Xiao Orange Science and Technology held that Guangdong Pacific was not a suitable defendant. It only provided the free download of the APP "drip trip" on the network, did not implement the patent method involved, and there was no direct or indirect infringement, and should not be listed as a defendant in the case.
Secondly, the place of infringement in this case is not in Guangdong.
According to the law, the place of infringement of the patent involved should be the place where the patent method involved is fully implemented. Therefore, the author raised an objection to the jurisdiction of the court and requested that the case be transferred to the court of the defendant's place of residence, namely the Beijing Intellectual Property Court, for trial.
The Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court held that the defendant Guangdong Pacific provided the alleged infringement drip travel APP products on its network platform, and that it was not improper for the plaintiff to list the defendant Guangdong Pacific as the defendant.
And the defendant's Guangdong Pacific residence is in Guangzhou, which is under the jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The defendant, Xiao-orange Science and Technology, claimed that the case should be transferred to the Beijing Intellectual Property Court for trial. On the basis of insufficient evidence, he rejected the objection raised by the defendant, Xiao-orange Science and Technology Co., Ltd. to the jurisdiction of the case and bear the expenses for accepting the jurisdiction objection case.
At present, other trials of the case have not been announced, and journalists will also pay close attention to the follow-up details of the drip-drip travel patent infringement case.
Interview with the Chief Executive Officer of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization of Australia: Remarkable achievements of Australia-China scientific and technological cooperation
"China's science and technology has developed rapidly in the past few decades, and Australia and China can achieve fruitful results by working together in the scientific field."
Larry Marshall, Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Federal Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, said in an interview with the China News Agency in Beijing that Australia-China cooperation in the field of science and technology has shown great vitality from the response to climate change to the cooperation of the "Eye in the Sky" project.
As the largest national scientific research institution in the Commonwealth of Australia, CSIRO has achieved many innovative research results that have attracted worldwide attention in the fields of ocean, energy, biology, materials and astronomy.
CSIRO has always maintained a close cooperative relationship with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and other scientific research institutions.
"This is a lasting friendship, which includes trust in partners and a tradition of long-term cooperation," Marshall said.
In May this year, China's 500-meter-caliber spherical radio telescope, the "China Sky Eye," installed the first 19-beam L-band receiver in the world.
The 19-beam feed receiver, which is currently the most advanced in the world, was jointly developed by Chinese and Australian scientists.
Marshall said that the successful development of the receiver is based on the technical accumulation of CSIRO for many years. After commissioning, the FAST survey speed will be increased by five to six times, and at the same time, more scientific observation targets will be expanded.
"This is a part of CSIRO's contribution to FAST."
In addition to the above-mentioned cooperation, CSIRO has close cooperation with Chinese scientific research institutions in the construction of square kilometre array radio telescopes, research and development of new fuel technologies, energy conservation and emission reduction.
"In the past, scientific research often focused on the problems after hundreds of years, and more scientific research forces are needed to solve the problems in front of them."
Marshall believes that Australia and China are complementary in the field of scientific development, while both countries are facing a series of challenges in their development.
For example, extreme weather occurs frequently all over the world, drought and floods have led to the reduction of food production, and food shortage has seriously affected human development.
At the same time, problems such as population explosion, aging and chronic diseases are also serious challenges at present.
"The cooperation between Australia and China in recent years has mainly focused on solving these current problems."
Marshall said that the International Southern Hemisphere Marine Research Center, jointly established by CSIRO and the Qingdao National Laboratory of Marine Science and Technology, focuses on observing the El Niño and La Niña phenomena, studying the relationship between the two and extreme weather and establishing early warning facilities for extreme weather. The new grain varieties developed by CSIRO and the Chinese Academy of Sciences to overcome extreme weather can also alleviate the food shortage caused by extreme weather.
"In the current environment, scientific and technological innovation is difficult to complete on its own, requires extremely high costs, and there are many problems to be solved, so cooperation is particularly important today."
Marshall said that the closer the cooperation, the more likely it is to make breakthrough progress, which is also the significance of strengthening cooperation between Australia and China under the framework of the "Belt and Road."
"To strengthen bilateral cooperation, for us, it is mainly cooperation in science and technology."
Marshall said, for example, that CSIRO has recently developed a gold purification method that does not use cyanide. Because the traditional cyanide gold purification method is very harmful to the environment, many countries hope to find a gold purification method with little environmental pollution.
"We are very willing to introduce this technology into China, which is one of the achievements of our participation in the" Belt and Road "cooperation."

North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued imposition of sanctions is deepening the DPRK's distrust of the United States and that the DPRK cannot unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the United Nations General Assembly that the DPRK has adopted a "very friendly approach" in the past year, including stopping missile and nuclear tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and committing to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we have not seen any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"If we do not trust the United States, we will have no confidence in our national security. Under such circumstances, it is impossible for us to give up weapons unilaterally first."
Although Ri Yong Ho repeated the DPRK's complaint about the US opposition to "phased" denuclearization, his speech was of great significance because he did not completely reject unilateral denuclearization as the DPRK had done before.
Ri Yong Ho referred to the joint statement of Kim Jong Un and Trump on June 12, when Kim Jong Un agreed to work towards the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula," while Trump promised to protect the security of North Korea.
North Korea has been seeking to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says North Korea must give up its nuclear weapons first.
The United States also refused to relax its demand for international sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
"The United States insists on 'denuclearization first' and increases the pressure of sanctions to achieve its goal in a high-pressure manner, and even refuses to issue a 'declaration on the end of the war'," Li said.
"The idea that sanctions can make us kneel and beg for mercy is that people who do not know us are daydreaming.
But the problem is that such continued sanctions are deepening our mistrust, "he said.
Li Yung-ho did not mention the plan of the second special gold meeting mentioned by the President of the United States at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, he stressed the three meetings between Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in in the past five months and said: "If the other side of denuclearization is South Korea and not North Korea, then the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula will not become so deadlocked."
China announced that as of November 1, 2018, it will reduce import duties on 1,585 tax items.
Since the beginning of this year, China has taken the initiative to reduce import tariffs in succession.
On May 1 this year, the drug tax was reduced in an all-round way, and the import duties of all common drugs, including anti-cancer drugs, alkaloid drugs with anti-cancer effects and Chinese patent medicines with actual import were adjusted to zero for a total of 28 tax purposes.
At the same time, the value-added tax burden in the production and import of anti-cancer drugs has been greatly reduced.
On July 1, the tax on automobiles and spare parts for 218 tax purposes was reduced.
After the tax reduction, China's total vehicle tax rate has been lower than the average level of developing countries, which is in line with the reality of China's automobile industry.
This tax reduction will promote the restructuring of the industry and the optimal allocation of resources, accelerate the elimination of winners and losers, help improve the quality of products and services, and is expected to promote the adjustment of automobile prices to a certain extent, so that consumers can get more benefits.
On July 1, the tax was reduced on 1,449 daily consumer goods for tax purposes.
The reduction of tax on daily consumer goods is closely related to the people's need for a better life.
The tax reduction is not only large in number but also strong, with an average tax reduction of 56%.
The reduction of taxes on consumer goods for daily use will directly benefit the vast number of consumers and promote the competitiveness of domestic industries.
On November 1, a tax reduction will be implemented on 1,585 industrial products such as mechanical and electrical equipment, spare parts and raw materials.
A proper reduction of import tariffs on some domestic urgently needed industrial products can attract more foreign investment, help increase effective domestic supply and help industrial upgrading. At the same time, it will help enterprises to allocate resources worldwide, reduce production costs and reduce the pressure on the domestic environment.
According to the relevant person-in-charge of the office of the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council of China, the above four independent tax reductions, as well as the third step of tax reduction implemented on July 1 this year in accordance with the results of the negotiations on the expansion of the scope of the information technology agreement, will reduce China's total tariff level from 9.8% in the previous year to 7.5%.
The adjusted total tariff level is slightly higher than that of the EU, lower than that of most developing countries, and is at a medium to low level, basically matching China's status as a developing country and its stage of development.
The person-in-charge introduced that the total tariff level, as one of the important indicators of China's openness in the field of trade in goods, should adapt to the stage of China's economic development and reflect the characteristics of the times.
China's trade in goods is the largest in the world and already has the economic basis for further opening up, but the quality and benefits of trade development are still far from those of developed economies. Therefore, the overall level of tariffs should be appropriately reduced.
Tariffs are a means of protection for compliance, and the level of tariffs should be commensurate with industrial competitiveness. Benign competition should be encouraged, and excessive protection is not conducive to industrial development and quality improvement.
The adjustment of tariff rates should take into account the needs of production and consumption.
We will focus on reducing the commodity tax rate, which has a large domestic demand and is conducive to industrial transformation and upgrading, strive to increase the import of products with characteristic advantages where the needs of the people are relatively concentrated, continuously enhance the sense of acquisition of enterprises and the public, and meet the needs of upgrading the industrial structure and consumption structure.
The intensity of tax reduction should take into account the financial revenue and the affordability of industrial development.
In the selection of specific tax-reducing commodities and the range of tax reduction, it is necessary to coordinate the relationship between domestic and foreign markets, upstream and downstream, production and consumption, so as to maintain the steady and sound development momentum of China's economy.
The person-in-charge stressed that this year marks the 40th anniversary of reform and opening-up, and that China's initiative to reduce the overall level of import tariffs is a major measure in accordance with China's own needs to achieve high-quality development, which is conducive to the overall utilization of international and foreign resources, promoting the quality improvement of the domestic supply system and meeting the needs of the people's consumption upgrading.
This action and initiative shows that China will unswervingly follow the mutually beneficial and win-win opening-up strategy, firmly support economic globalization, firmly uphold the principle of free trade and the multilateral trading system with the WTO as the core, continue to draw development momentum from opening up to the world and make China's development better benefit the world.
The President of Serbia and Russia will meet tomorrow to discuss the situation in Kosovo
Nantong News Agency quoted the Serbian President's Office as saying that in view of the fact that the Kosovo Special Forces occupied the passage of the water storage lake of the Gazivoda Hydropower Station in the north of Kosovo, which is controlled by the Belgrade side, Serbian President Vučić ordered the country's armed forces to enter the highest state of readiness.
On September 29, Serbian Defense Minister Vulin declared that the Serbian army had entered a state of full combat readiness.
Vulin stressed that as long as the order issued by Vučić remains valid, Serbia will continue to monitor the current situation in Kosovo and the Serbian Army will respond regardless of the direction of the situation.
According to the Russian news agency Tass, on September 29, Vučić said in an interview that he had briefed the US, Russia, Europe and other parties on the current situation and would go to Moscow on October 2 to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin and seek Putin's support on the Kosovo issue.
When asked whether Serbia needs Russia's military support like Syria, Vučić gave a negative answer: "I do not want a major military conflict on our territory."
Vučić also said that the entry of the Serbian Army into full combat readiness is only to form a deterrent to prevent the occurrence of conflict, but it is also a clear warning that any violence in Kosovo will never be tolerated.
The reason why the Serbian Army has raised its combat readiness is related to the two major moves of the Kosovo side.
According to the Serbian side, in recent days, Albanians have been aggressively arresting Serbs who have lived there for generations in the northern part of Kosovo, and these arrested Serbs have not violated any law.
According to Vučić, since March 26 this year, when the head of the Serbian Government Office for Kosovo and Metohija, Marko Jurić, was beaten and detained by the Kosovo Albanian Army, ethnic Albanians have continuously escalated the situation in the region and carried out inhuman arrest and expulsion of Serbs.
In addition, more than 100 people, including the ROSU special forces, armed police and snipers of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Kosovo, which recently announced itself, occupied positions near the water storage lake of the Gazivoda Hydropower Station, entered the ecological and sports centre near the dike in the northern part of the Kosovo region and blocked all nearby roads, which were originally controlled by the Serbian side.
Vučić pointed out that this military venture of Kosovo was instigated by Western countries and that the move of the Kosovo Army did not inform the Serbian side in advance, in violation of the first paragraph of Chapter IX of the Brussels Agreement, as well as the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 and the military-technical agreement between Seko.
Vučić has called out to NATO Secretary-General Stoltenberg and criticized the hypocritical rhetoric of Western countries on the Kosovo issue.
The root cause of the current conflict is still the centuries-old historical enmity between the Serbian and Albanian communities in Kosovo.
With regard to the attribution of Kosovo, the Serbs and Albanians have their own versions.
Serbia regards Kosovo as the birthplace of the nation and the cradle of culture, because Serbia established its strongest state here in the 12th century, and ethnic Albanians only moved in large numbers after the invasion of the Ottoman Empire and the defeat of the Serbian army in the north.
For their part, the Albanians insist that the Illyrians, a primitive tribe that lived in Kosovo in the 4th-5th century BC, are the ancestors of the Albanians, and therefore Kosovo has been an Albanian territory since ancient times.
The subjective political division has resulted in fierce conflicts between different nationalities, religions and cultures, resulting in fierce antagonism between Serbs and Albanians in the Kosovo region.
In 1912, the Kosovo Albanians first declared the independence of Albania.
After the First World War, a large number of Albanians living in the Balkans moved to Turkey, and the proportion of Serbs increased relatively. In the view of the Serbs, the practice of "just taking back their own land" was regarded by the Albanians as the plunder of "Greater Serbia," and the contradictions between the two communities intensified.
Kosovo has become a "powder keg" in the Balkans.
In 1999, the armed conflict between the Albanian separatists in the Kosovo Liberation Army and the Serbian army and police led to the bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia composed of Serbia and Montenegro by NATO troops and the outbreak of the war in Kosovo.
On February 17, 2008, Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia.
Since then, although it has been reported that Serbia will normalize relations with Kosovo and sign a global and legally binding agreement, due to historical ethnic feuds and geopolitical constraints, the agreement, which is subject to the United States, Europe and Russia and other forces, has not been signed.
Just one month ago, Vučić made it clear for the first time that he advocated the separation of Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo and once again made public the contradictions between the two communities.
Power communication still interrupted Indonesia's strong earthquake and tsunami relief difficulties
According to the figures released by the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency in the early hours of March 30, the strong earthquake and tsunami that occurred in Dungara County, Central Sulawesi Province, on August 28, has killed 420 people.
According to Wilem Rampangilei, head of the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, the figure is only the preliminary statistics of the city of Palu, the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, about 80 km from the epicenter of the earthquake. Because of the lack of large-scale search and rescue machinery, many people-intensive buildings in the city, such as hotels, shopping malls and warehouses, damaged by the collapse of the earthquake, have not yet been searched.
On September 29, 2018, local time, a bridge damaged by the earthquake and tsunami collapsed and broke into several sections in Ba Road, Indonesia.
Due to the serious damage to power and communication facilities, Dungara County, the epicenter of the earthquake, and the adjacent Xigi area are still unreachable "isolated islands," and it is impossible to count the number of victims.
The media reported that Indonesian Vice President Kara said that the death toll may be in the thousands.
Power interruption, communication interruption, road blocking and damage to the airport... The rescue work after the strong earthquake and tsunami is very difficult.
Due to the power outage, some hospitals and rescue settlements in the city of Palu need to rely on fuel to generate electricity.
The roads in and out of the city were blocked by landslides, and large transport vehicles, including oil tankers, were unable to enter, making the fuel supply very tight.
Indonesian Social Minister Agus said that due to road damage, the emergency relief materials such as tents, mattresses, blankets, clothes, food and household goods packages transferred by the Ministry from South Sulawesi and Gorontalo provinces adjacent to the earthquake area have not yet arrived in the disaster area.
The disaster relief materials transferred from the capital Jakarta are being transported to the disaster area by air force transport aircraft.
In view of the damage to the command tower and runway of Palu airport in the earthquake, in order to ensure safety and ensure rescue, all commercial flights have been suspended for the take-off and landing of military aircraft carrying relief materials and personnel only.
Wiranto, the Indonesian Minister of Political, Legal and Security Affairs, who directed the rescue in the earthquake area, requested that the power supply and airport commercial flight services be restored as soon as possible so as to ensure the operation of hospitals and other relief agencies, so that more rescue workers, volunteers and aid materials can reach the disaster area.
On August 28, a series of strong earthquakes occurred in Dungara County, Central Sulawesi Province, Indonesia. Among them, a strong 7.7-magnitude earthquake at 17: 02 local time triggered a tsunami, causing major disasters in Palu City, Dungara County and Xiji area.
China News Agency, Beijing, October 1 (Xinhua) -- In recent days, Beijing has continued to open the most beautiful blue sky model, attracting thousands of people in the capital to show their happiness on social platforms, saying that "under the blue sky and white clouds, the 'drunk' beautiful skyline is the best business card in Beijing."
Since August, Beijing has welcomed the "bluest sky."
In the capital, people can be seen at any time and anywhere, either holding a smartphone or holding a SLR camera to take photos.
On social platforms such as Weibo and Weixin Friends Circle, the Forbidden City, Tiananmen, Bird's Nest and Hutong can be seen everywhere in the netizen lens... All kinds of buildings show different beauty against the blue sky.
Some netizens said that such a "scenic blockbuster" is the best urban propaganda film in Beijing; others quipped that if such a blue sky is painted on the screen for a long time, people with cervical spondylosis can be cured; and more netizens hope that "this blue can go through winter and spring and summer, so that the sky curtain of the capital is blue in all seasons."
Why do people in the capital especially love to bask in the blue sky?
Only because people who lived in the city in the past suffered from haze and haze, they especially longed for the blue sky. After the "Blue Sky Defense Campaign" was launched in Beijing and the air quality was continuously improved, the haze became less and the blue sky increased.
On the National Day, the weather in Beijing was fine.
At 8 a.m., the vast majority of the city's 35 air quality monitoring stations showed "first-class excellent" green.
The "Blue Sky" theme photography competition initiated by the people on the social platform is still going on.
Why is the sky so blue in Beijing recently?
According to the relevant officials of the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau, in August this year, the average concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in Beijing was 35 micrograms per cubic meter, the best record for the same period in the past five years.
The real-time concentration of PM2.5 in September is more frequent in single digits.
A major factor in the emergence of the "bluest sky" lies in the overall favorable meteorological conditions in the recent period. More importantly, Beijing has consistently carried out air pollution control, vigorously promoted the clean air action plan in the past five years, and continuously released environmental benefits, thus reducing the total amount of pollutants discharged in the region, all of which have laid the foundation for the continuous improvement of air quality.
Beijing officially issued and implemented the Beijing Clean Air Action Plan 2013-2017 in 2013.
According to the plan, the government has continuously guided non-capital functions to unravel, promoted clean energy substitution and pollution reduction, and eliminated a total of 4,923 coal-fired boilers.
As a result, Beijing has also become the first major city in mainland China to realize full-network natural gas.
The data show that between 2013 and 2017, the average annual concentration of PM2.5 in Beijing decreased by 35.6%; the number of days to meet the air quality standards increased by 50 days; the number of first-class excellent days increased by 25 days; and the number of days of heavy pollution decreased by 35 days, and the incidence of heavy pollution decreased significantly.
While the air quality continues to improve, Beijing officials, on the basis of a new round of PM2.5 source analysis, issued the "Three-year Action Plan for Beijing to Win the Blue Sky Defense War" in September this year, focusing on the current control stage and pollution characteristics, focusing on the key prevention and control areas such as diesel trucks, dust raising and volatile organic matter control, optimizing and adjusting the transport structure, industrial structure, energy structure and land use structure, strengthening regional joint prevention and control, focusing on strengthening the fine urban management, promoting green development in an all-round way, and striving to make the "bluest sky" resident in the capital city, so that it will no longer be "rare and expensive," so that it will return to the background of people's photo album rather than the main character.
During this year's National Day Golden Week, the Municipal Tourism Commission, industry and commerce, city administration, public security and other relevant departments will strengthen the law enforcement inspection of the "one-day tour" market, focusing on the "six black" chaos of tourism. Once the illegal violators are verified, they will be given a heavier and more severe punishment in accordance with the law.
Yesterday morning, the municipal government held a special meeting to crack down on illegal "one-day tours" and made arrangements for a special operation to further crack down on illegal "one-day tours."
At the meeting, it was revealed that focusing on the "six black" chaos in which the interests of black ticket holders, black guides, black clubs, black cars, black shops and black networks are intertwined, the city has launched a special operation to crack down on illegal "one-day tours" since July 28.
Since the launch of the special operation, the city has received 39 complaints of "one-day tours," a decrease of 63% year-on-year. Since the beginning of this year, the city has accepted 270 complaints of "one-day tours," a decrease of 62% year-on-year.
In the past two months, the city has seized 248 "black cars," investigated and dealt with 158 violations of tourist passenger transport business, closed 29 shopping "black shops" and performing arts venues, investigated and dealt with 13 "black clubs" and 27 "black guides," confiscated 26,000 illegal advertisements, dismantled 31 illegal "one-day tour" billboards and 3 public transport fake stop signs, investigated and dealt with 1,789 illegal travel-related acts, and filed 181 cases with various functional departments, resulting in a heavy fine of 4.48 million yuan and the detention of 111 travel-related illegal personnel.
After rectification, the illegal "one-day tour" disorder has been basically checked, and the market order of "one-day tour" has shown a steady and positive trend.
According to the report, in recent years, the city has continuously increased its efforts to rectify illegal "one-day tours."
In 2016 and 2017, the Municipal Tourism Commission accepted 1612 and 897 complaints of "one-day tours," which decreased by 79% and 44% year-on-year, respectively. However, the illegal "one-day tours" still repeatedly hit and often rebounded, and formed a "six-black" chaos in which the interests of black ticket holders, black guides, black clubs, black cars, black shops and black networks are intertwined.
In particular, illegal street hikers are "black ticket holders," illegal websites that publish false travel information are "black networks," travel agencies engaged in illegal "one-day tours" or organizations or individuals without travel agency operating qualifications are "black clubs," and tourist guides employed by "black clubs" without tourist guide cards or illegal practice are "black guides," which use vehicles without tourist passenger qualification or vehicles with tourist passenger qualification that provide passenger service for illegal "one-day tours," and eventually they bring tourists into designated tourist shops.
In this special operation, the city has continuously increased its fixed inspection and mobile inspection of illegal "one-day tours." In response to the high incidence of illegal "one-day tours" and the high impact of tourist routes, the relevant departments send an unannounced visit team to board and accompany the group on a daily basis, and after finding evidence of illegal violations, they will be strictly investigated and dealt with in accordance with the law.
Among them, "black car" and "black shop" have become the two key points in the special operation.
According to the report, without the black car, the illegal "one-day tour" cannot be made, and the black car is not only easy to be found, remembered and investigated, but also a fixed asset with high individual value.
The relevant departments use road traffic monitoring probes to increase the supervision of tourist buses on key "one-day tour" routes, and can find and deal with "black cars" in a timely manner with technological and intelligent means such as technical and physical prevention.
Tourism shopping "black shops" have also become the focus of strict crackdown because of their small number and sit-down operation.
In order to strengthen the efforts to deter and crack down on illegal "one-day tours," all functional departments shall, in accordance with the law, impose heavier and more severe penalties on those who are found to have violated laws and regulations in the special operations.
In August this year, the city also held a seminar on legal issues related to the strict crackdown on illegal "one-day tours," which discussed the means and measures of combining administrative punishment with criminal conviction.
The Municipal Tourism Commission said that in the future, more regular travel agencies will be encouraged to carry out "one-day tours" in Beijing and increase the supply of regular "one-day tours," so as to further squeeze the living space of illegal "one-day tours," and the specific plans are still under study.
In addition, the Municipal Tourism Commission has continuously improved the electronic itinerary information system of tourist groups to ensure that each team is included in the supervision of the electronic itinerary platform.
From a tourism symbol to a digital economy symbol, what has Wuzhen experienced in these years
As the permanent meeting site of the World Internet Congress, much attention has been paid to how Wuzhen can take on the dividends of the Summit.
Since the first World Internet Congress, the changes in Wuzhen have been witnessed in the past five years.
In 2014, there were only 12 enterprises related to the digital economy and the Internet in the town, and by the third quarter of this year, there had been more than 500.
This is a microcosm of the development of digital economy in Wuzhen.
The convening of the Internet Congress has enabled local enterprises to accept the inspiration of the digital economy and digital wave at zero distance. The desire of enterprises to transform and upgrade is very strong, and traditional manufacturing enterprises have increased their investment and research and development in machine replacement and intelligent management.
Jiang Wei, the party secretary of Wuzhen Town, said that Wuzhen will build a new economic empowerment center in the future.
The development of digital economy cannot be separated from the support of infrastructure.
This year, Wuzhen launched the 5G pilot work on the basis of realizing the full coverage of 4G communication network and free WiFi.
At the same time, Tongxiang City, where Wuzhen is located, as the first county-level city in the country to build a special channel for international Internet data, has also become a hot land for the development of the Internet industry.
Since the first World Internet Congress, a total of 565 digital economy projects have been introduced in Tongxiang, with a total planned investment of 37.725 billion yuan. The total output value of the core manufacturing industry of the digital economy was 8.73 billion yuan in the first three quarters of this year, and the added value increased by 13% year-on-year.
"Before Wuzhen was a tourist symbol, then there were more drama and cultural symbols. Because of the Internet Congress, it has now become the symbol of the Internet and digital economy."
According to Sheng Yung Jun, secretary of the Tongxiang Municipal Committee, the dividends of the World Internet Congress have accumulated over time, so it is more necessary to build a platform to undertake the superimposed introduction of talents, projects and technologies from all sides.
Shen Yi, a native of Tongxiang, worked abroad for 20 years and returned to his hometown to start a business because of his association with the Internet Congress.
On December 2 last year, he entered the 4th Internet Light Expo with a high-capacity anti-tampering digital technology solution, which was favored by many customers.
Shen Yi chose to start a business in Wuzhen not only because of his hometown complex. "In Wuzhen, it is easier to recruit people than I thought, and our application also landed quickly. There is our application in Wuzhen intelligent parking project."
A Wuzhen Avenue presents the spillover effect of the Internet Congress.
This road, which runs through the north and south of Tongxiang, is not only a series of tourist attractions, but also an industrial road.
Relying on it, the Ke-Chuang agglomeration area of Wuzhen Avenue came into being.
The reporter learned that in the future, Wuzhen Avenue will become the main position for the industrial development of Tongxiang, taking the lead in applying a large number of achievements such as intelligent medical care, intelligent old-age care and intelligent government affairs, and gathering industries accounting for 80% of the city's GDP and a large number of high-level talents.
A tsunami triggered by a strong earthquake in Indonesia has killed at least 410 people
According to the Director of the Public Information Bureau of the Jakarta Police of Indonesia on the evening of 29, 410 people have been killed in the earthquake in Central Sulawesi province, 97 of whom have been identified.
Another 29 people were missing and 540 were injured.
Palu airport is still closed.
With active treatment, the survival rate of premature infants aged 29 weeks and above in China has reached 98%, which has reached the level of developed countries.
Shanghai, September 30 (Chen Jing Luoyanqian), the National Children's Medical Center and the Pediatric Hospital affiliated to Fudan University revealed that it introduced Canada's advanced methods in the leading "China NICU project to improve the quality of prognosis of hospitalized premature infants."
The results of the project show that after active treatment, the survival rate of premature infants aged 29 weeks and above in China has reached 98%, which has reached the level of developed countries, but there is still much room for improvement in the survival rate of premature infants and premature infants with minimal gestational age without complications.
For the past 20 years, the Chinese government has been paying attention to the treatment of newborns.
At present, the infant mortality rate in Shanghai has dropped to 3.71 per thousand, which is significantly lower than the national average and has reached the advanced level of developed countries.
The "China NICU Inpatient Premature Infant Prognosis Quality Improvement Project" has greatly improved the quality of life of premature infants through four years of unremitting efforts.
Professor Cao Yun, director of the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of the Pediatric Hospital affiliated to Fudan University, told reporters that while improving the survival rate of premature infants, paying attention to reducing the survival quality of premature infants, reducing the incidence of complications, improving the prognosis of neurodevelopment and improving the overall outcome of children is of great significance to improving the overall quality of life and population of premature infants. It is an important issue of concern to the pediatrics and neonatology circles at home and abroad, and is also the key issue of this project.
Through four years of unremitting efforts, the "China NICU Project for Improving the Prognostic Quality of Inpatient Premature Infants" has included tens of thousands of premature infants with a gestational age of 33 weeks and below, resulting in a one-third reduction in the mortality rate of domestic infants with small gestational age and low birth weight. At the same time, the incidence of serious complications of premature infants has decreased significantly, greatly improving the quality of life of premature infants.
Through the establishment of a national cooperative network for quality improvement of newborns and the introduction of the concept of collaborative quality improvement, the project radiated 25 cooperative hospitals throughout China, and established a complete, systematic and effective cooperative quality improvement method for improving the prognosis of premature infants and improving the treatment level of newborns, which is suitable for the national conditions.
The Pediatric Hospital affiliated to Fudan University is working with the national neonatal department to formulate guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections based on the accumulated experience of the project, so as to provide reference and guidance for the standardized diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections in China.
It is understood that in the "China Premature Infant Prognosis Quality Improvement Project," pediatric hospitals have introduced the EPIQ method into 25 large-scale NICUs in 19 provinces across the country, and are committed to solving the problem of premature infant infection plaguing China's neonatal care units.
After more than 10 years of continuous improvement, the non-complication survival rate of premature infants in Canada has increased by about one third, and Canada has now become one of the countries with the best prognosis of premature babies in the world.
The EPIQ method has been applied to all NICUs in Canada and has been adopted by six countries.
The pediatric hospital revealed that the results of the study showed that after two years of EPIQ intervention, the infection of premature infants decreased by 35%, while the use of antibiotics decreased by 20%.
In the future, the pediatric hospital affiliated to Fudan University will continue to promote and implement this method throughout the country, with a view to reducing the incidence of all complications of premature infants in an all-round way and improving the quality of treatment for newborns throughout the country.
At present, it is an indisputable fact that there are differences and inequalities in the level of treatment in various regions of China.
According to Professor Cao Yun, as an important construction unit of the National Children's Medical Center, the pediatric hospital will play a leading role in radiation. The study covers a number of western provinces, including Xinjiang, Guizhou, Gansu and Shaanxi, with a view to gradually promoting the homogeneity and standardization of neonatal treatment throughout the country.
It is understood that the Pediatric Hospital affiliated to Fudan University is working with the national neonatal department to formulate guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections based on the accumulated experience of the project, so as to provide reference and guidance for the standardized diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections in China.
It was revealed that in 2019, the China Neonatal Collaboration Network, which is located at the Pediatric Hospital affiliated to Fudan University, will work with 63 hospitals across the country to carry out the next stage of national quality improvement, with a view to promoting the uniform development of the treatment level of newborns in China.
Wu Jinglei, director of the Shanghai Municipal Health and Family Planning Commission, said that Shanghai can become a central city in the center of Asia, not only in research, but also in the construction of the whole service system. The service quality and service achievements should have a place in Asia, thus truly reflecting China's medical level.
Xin Zhiping: Build the "Hero Monument" in the heart - written on the fifth anniversary of the martyr.
On September 30, on the eve of the Republic's 69-year-old Chinese birthday, we ushered in the fifth anniversary of martyrs, and Xi Jinping and other party and state leaders came to Tiananmen Square to attend the ceremony of laying flower baskets to the people's heroes.
At this moment, no matter where you are, please pay tribute to Yingliang.
The anniversary is a re-visit and a wake-up call.
Turning over the thick history, behind the name of every martyr is a living life.
They also have fiery youth, sincere love and concerned family members.
However, because they firmly believe that "the doctrine we believe in is the truth of the universe," they are willing to sacrifice everything in order to "relieve the suffering of the next generation."
"One day I live, I will shout one day for China."
Through time and space, the British heroes set up a spiritual signpost to guide the way forward.
"Where to come from and where to go" "What kind of person to be" and read Yingliang, it is not difficult to get an answer.
To commemorate Yingliang, the most important thing is to build a "hero monument" in the heart.
According to incomplete statistics, since the years of the Revolutionary War, some 20 million martyrs have died bravely for national independence, the liberation of the people and the prosperity and strength of the country.
For various reasons, many martyrs did not even leave their names.
Countless heroes have watered their ideals with blood, practiced their faith with life, remembered their names and passed on their spirit, which is to guard the root and soul of the nation.
This "Monument to Heroes" is not allowed to be defaced or destroyed.
For some time, there has been an undercurrent of historical nihilism and pan-entertainment.
All kinds of practices that distort history and degrade the British and strong, challenge the just conscience, derail the value judgment, and arouse the public indignation and vigilance of the whole society.
The heroic should not be desecrated, and the hero should not be forgotten.
The act of touching the bottom line cannot be allowed to go unchecked. We must dare to shine the sword and defend the heroic dignity with the rule of law and justice.
On May 1 this year, the Law on the Protection of Heroes and Martyrs came into force.
From the perspective of judicial practice, the judgments of some cases are very popular. They not only effectively maintain the glorious image of the British and strong in accordance with the law, but also release the positive energy of advocating heroes and respecting the ancestors.
A nation with pursuits cannot be without heroes, and a country with ideals cannot be without pioneers.
It has become a universal social consensus to remember the martyrs and call for heroes.
At present, there are millions of memorial facilities throughout the country, and more than 100 million people visit the Martyrs' Mausoleum every year.
The human heart is the most solid foundation.
Let the worship of heroes, the defense of heroes, the study of heroes and the care of heroes become a trend, so that the heroic spirit can be integrated into the national blood, and a "monument to heroes" will stand tall between heaven and earth and in the depths of the people's hearts.
Brussels, September 28 (Reuters) - After Italy flouted the demands of the European Union and surprised the market with a large budget deficit plan, the European Union adopted a non-confrontational stance against Italy on Friday, but if Italy insists on too bold a goal, the European Union may take a more aggressive stance.
Italy's Eurosceptic government aims to have a budget deficit equivalent to 2.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) in the next three years, which shows that there has been no debt reduction despite the demand for deficit reduction.
"We have no interest in the crisis between the Executive Committee and Italy," Moskovisi, the Economic Affairs Executive Committee of the EU Executive Committee, said Friday, adding that he took a cautious response as the EU's proposals and sanctions may have little impact on Italy.
EU officials and diplomats still hope that market forces will persuade Italy to adjust its budget plan before it is formally submitted to the EU Executive Committee in mid-October.
After the government announced its plan, the euro fell to its lowest level in nearly two weeks on Friday, while Italian bond yields hit their highest level in three weeks.
If the deficit target remains unchanged before the October deadline, the EU Executive Committee may veto Italy's draft budget, which is something that the Executive Committee has never done to any country.
At a meeting in the Latvian capital Riga later on Friday, the Vice-Chairman of the EU Executive Committee, Dobrovsky, said that Italy's current fiscal plan "seems to be inconsistent with the Stability and Growth Pact," referring to the EU's financial regulations.
But he did not say how this would trigger a reaction from the EU.
Tenderers may submit their applications to participate in the public tender before October 26 this year.
Previously, the Russian Ministry of Agriculture regarded China as one of the priority markets for the export of Russian agricultural products.
The Russian Agricultural Supervision Bureau announced in May that Russia's grain exports to China exceeded 1 million tons for the first time in this agricultural year, setting a new record.
The bureau predicts that China may be among the top 10 Russian grain importers.
Sapporo, China News Agency, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Following the 3-0 victory over Cuba in the first game, the Chinese women's volleyball team again beat Turkey 3-0 on September 30, reaping two consecutive wins in the group stage of the 2018 World Championships.
However, compared with the first battle, the Chinese women's volleyball team is more difficult and dangerous.
There are 24 teams participating in the 2018 Women's Volleyball World Championships, and the Chinese women's volleyball team is in Group B with Italy, Turkey, Bulgaria, Canada and Cuba.
Judging from the world ranking and overall strength of the teams in Group B, the Turkish team and the Italian team are the main rivals of the Chinese team.
After the start of the match on the same day, the Chinese team entered the state relatively quickly, took the lead at the beginning of the game, maintained its advantage all the way, put a lot of pressure on the opponent in serving and blocking, and won the first game more smoothly at 25: 18.
The Turkish team that entered the second game served very fiercely and took a 6-2 lead at the beginning of the game. After requesting a suspension, the Chinese team adjusted its formation and gradually tied the score to 7, then blocked the score several times and hit a 7-0 scoring tide. At the end of the game, the Turkish team once chased the score to 15: 19. After the Chinese team got the set point at 24: 20, the tenacious Turkish team chased two points. After the Chinese team again requested a suspension, it won the second game with Zhu Ting's running attack score at 25: 23.
In the third game, the situation was very sticky. The score of the two sides rose alternately, and at one point it was tied at 19.
At the critical moment, the Turkish team made a mistake. After taking the lead at 21: 19, the Chinese team won the match point at 24: 21 with Zhu Ting's strong smash and Zhang Changning's attack. Then the Turkish team chased the score to 23: 24. After the Chinese team requested a suspension, Zhang Changning scored an attack and the Chinese team clinched the victory at 25: 23.
Lang Ping, head coach of the Chinese women's volleyball team, admitted after the game that the whole game was not easy.
"We are well prepared, the blocking is good, and the Turkish team is more comprehensive in technology. We must reduce our mistakes and strive to win by scoring on our own initiative."
In the face of her former familiar teammates, Zhu Ting, who played for the Turkish Wakiver Bank team, was subjected to many restrictions in the first game of the match on the same day. Then she took the initiative to change and still played a strong attack.
"We are familiar with each other and it is normal to be watched by our opponents, but the Chinese team played to the utmost and played well in blocking and attacking in the case of a bad pass."
Next, the Chinese women's volleyball team will hold a one-day truce for physical and technical training. On October 2, it will face Canada, the third opponent in the group competition.
On September 30 (Cui Zhiping Wang Peng), the Hengshui High-tech Zone in Hebei held a ceremony for the concentrated start of key projects in the second half of 2018.

Nearly 1,000 state-owned scenic spots have reduced their gate ticket prices by more than half by more than 20%
[Abstract] As of September 28, various places have put in place or sent letters to announce to the public the free opening or price reduction measures of 981 scenic spots (74 free opening and 907 price reduction), and the price reduction has been implemented in Shilin, Dali Three Towers and Yulong Snow Mountain in Yunnan, Li River in Guangxi, Wuyi Mountain in Fujian, Zhangjiajie in Hunan, Terracotta Warriors and Horses in Shaanxi, Sanqing Mountain in Jiangxi and Kanas in Xinjiang.
In order to implement the decision-making and deployment of the Central Economic Work Conference and the Report on the Work of the Government, the National Development and Reform Commission issued the "Guiding Opinions on Improving the Mechanism for the Formation of Gate Ticket Prices in State-owned Scenic Areas to Reduce the Gate Ticket Prices of Key State-owned Scenic Areas" (hereinafter referred to as the Guiding Opinions) on June 28.
In accordance with the requirements of deployment, all localities have actively carried out work and have successively reduced the ticket prices of a number of key state-owned scenic spots.
As of September 28, various localities have put in place or sent letters to announce to the public the free opening or price reduction measures for 981 scenic spots (74 free and 907 reduced), including 159 scenic spots of Class 5A and 534 scenic spots of Class 4A, making a total of 693, accounting for 70.6%.
Of the 907 scenic spots with reduced prices, 491 fell by more than 20%, accounting for 54.3%, and 214 fell by more than 30%, accounting for 23.6%.
Yunnan, Shandong, Guangxi and Shaanxi provinces have a large number of reduced-price scenic spots, among which the number of reduced-price scenic spots in Yunnan is over 100, with an overall decrease of more than 30%.
The government of eight provinces (districts and cities), including Anhui and Chongqing, set the price of 5A-level scenic spots, all of which realized price reduction.
The Shilin, Dali Three Towers and Yulong Snow Mountain in Yunnan, the Li River in Guilin, Guangxi, Wuyi Mountain in Fujian, Zhangjiajie in Hunan, the Terracotta Warriors and Horses in Shaanxi, Sanqing Mountain in Jiangxi and Kanas in Xinjiang, which have received high social attention, have all implemented price reduction.
The gradual return of ticket prices of key state-owned scenic spots to a reasonable range is conducive to accelerating the transformation and upgrading of tourism from ticket economy to industrial economy, small-scale tourism to mass tourism and scenic spot tourism to tourism in the whole region, and is conducive to forming a virtuous circle of optimization of tourism supply structure and steady expansion of tourism consumption demand, so as to promote the sustained and healthy development of scenic spots and tourism.
At the same time, the National Development and Reform Commission stressed that all localities should strengthen the standardization of the price order of scenic spots, guide scenic spots to upgrade their services and ensure that the price reduction does not reduce the quality.
In addition, the National Development and Reform Commission has carried out special supervision on such issues as the recent media reports that the price of entrance tickets in individual scenic spots has been reduced too little and that the reduction is not real, requiring all localities to deal with them seriously, respond to social concerns in a timely manner and effectively implement the price reduction in place.
The Trade Promotion Bureau will carry out the short, medium and long-term optimization work in an orderly manner
The Macao Trade and Investment Promotion Bureau has submitted a short, medium and long-term optimization report on "major investment migration" and "skilled migration." At present, in addition to stepping up the promotion and implementation of all the work in the report, it has been continuously listening to the views of the community and continuously optimizing the contents of the report and related work.
The TDC will introduce the relevant optimization work to all sectors of the community as soon as possible.
Among them, five are short-term measures to be implemented within this year; five are medium-term measures to be implemented in 2019; and one is a long-term measure.
In addition, the TDC has also conducted a comprehensive review of its internal management system in accordance with the instructions of the Secretary for Economic and Financial Affairs, Mr Leung Wit.
The five short-term measures to be implemented in this year include:
1. To carry out the review work. Priority will be given to the review of cases that are about to expire for seven years, cases mentioned in the ICAC report and new renewal cases. If cases are found to contain irregularities or signs of violations, they will be referred to the relevant judicial authorities for follow-up action on their own initiative;
2. On-site inspection of projects involving "major investment migrants." By late September, more than 20 investment projects had been inspected;
3. To conduct a comprehensive review of the current assessment system. In the assessment of applications for "major investment migrants," six principles for the analysis of investment projects have been re-established. In the assessment of applications for "skilled migrants," the relevant examination and approval mechanism will be improved by clarifying the elements conducive to the development of Macao and the conditions for the priority admission of talents. At the same time, a list of "five industries and 10 jobs" for the annual priority introduction of talents has been drawn up to meet the policy direction of the SAR Government and attract talents in a more targeted manner;
4. To gradually increase the transparency of information, including the plan to gradually publish the approval criteria, evaluation criteria and proportion from the fourth quarter of this year, and to further refine and make public the examination and approval data;
5. In terms of improving the work of the confirmation mechanism, it has been required to check the work in Australia before confirmation; major investments must be checked on the spot and submit financial statements.
The five medium-term measures to be implemented in 2019 include:
1. To establish a mechanism for hearing the views of the Talent Development Committee and the Economic Development Committee on a regular basis. Among them, a working meeting was held with the Economic Development Committee in September to discuss the establishment of the mechanism.
2. To require the applicant to submit annual financial statements made by an independent third party in order to continuously review the operation of the investment project;
3. To further standardize and computerize the process of case application and approval in order to reduce human error;
4. To conduct a comprehensive review of the current staffing, in line with the implementation of a number of optimization measures;
5. To step up the research work on the revision of the "Temporary Residence System for Investors, Managers and Technicians with Special Qualifications."
As for long-term measures, we will step up the study on the revision of the law. It is expected that the drafting of relevant laws and regulations will be carried out in the first half of 2019, with a view to completing it as soon as possible, further clarifying the examination and approval criteria, review mechanism and confirmation mechanism for temporary residence permits, and increasing the investigation function of the TDC to more accurately examine and supervise applications for temporary residence permits.
The experts of the on-site observation and discussion and exchange activities of the national film-free cotton walked into the experimental field and listened to the presentation by the representative of the Yu Shuxun academician team of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.
Saya, Xinjiang, September 30 (Geng Dandan Wang Xiaojun) is located in the experimental base of film-free cotton cultivation in Saya County, Xinjiang. The film-free cotton is growing very well. Compared with the film-covered cotton next to it, it is "no less beautiful," and a cluster of snow-white cotton is competing to "open" and is covered with branches.
From September 27 to 28, the national on-site observation and discussion and exchange activities of film-free cotton were held in Shaya County, Xinjiang.
The reporter learned at the observation meeting that the film-free cotton technology system, with "Chinese cotton 619" and its supporting cultivation measures as the main body, has initially achieved the goal of film-free planting in cotton fields, reduced the pollution of the residual film of Xinjiang cotton fields to the ecological environment and raw cotton, and made significant progress in the research and demonstration of film-free cotton comprehensive technology.
Academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, famous cotton genetic breeder and chief scientist of the cotton system of the national modern agricultural industry technology system, academician Yu Shuxun, introduced the growth of film-free cotton to Zhou Guomo, Secretary of the Party Committee of Zhejiang Agricultural and Forestry University.
"The comprehensive technology of film-free cotton developed by us can fully realize the cultivation of cotton without film, and can completely solve the problem of residual film pollution and realize green cotton planting."
Introduced by Yu Shuxun, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.
Xinjiang is the most important cotton-producing area in China. According to the statistics of the National Bureau of Statistics, the cotton planting area in Xinjiang in 2017 is 35 million mu, accounting for 61% of the country's cotton area.
Since the introduction of the film into China in 1982, the film covering area of various crops in Xinjiang has reached more than 50 million mu, and the annual use of the film is about 300,000 tons.
Among them, the film cover rate of cotton reached 100%, and the film cover of cotton field accounted for about 60% of the amount of film used in Xinjiang.
The production of film-free cotton can be measured, and the yield of cotton can achieve a yield of 320 kg to 350 kg per mu.
With the continuous increase of the amount of film input in Xinjiang, the recovery rate of residual film is low, the amount of residual film in the soil is gradually increasing, and the residual film causes a series of problems, such as the destruction of soil structure, which seriously affects the sustainable development of agriculture.
The residual film not only causes serious pollution to the soil, but also has a great impact on the quality of cotton fiber.
At present, more than one-third of the cotton fields in Xinjiang have realized mechanized harvesting.
In 2017, the area of machine-picked cotton in Xinjiang is about 14 million mu.
In the process of machine-picked cotton harvest, a large amount of ground-surface and cotton-plant shredded film is received. The shredded film doped in raw cotton is difficult to be removed in the process of raw cotton processing and cannot be completely removed in the subsequent textile processing, which seriously affects the quality of textile products.
On September 28, the national on-site observation, discussion and exchange of film-free cotton was held in Shaya County, Xinjiang.
In order to focus on solving the membrane pollution of cotton fields, simplify the cotton planting technology and improve the benefits of cotton fields, Yu Shuxun led his team to implement the "Chinese cotton 619" film-free cotton technology cultivation over a period of eight years, so as to "add wings" to the green development of agriculture in Xinjiang.
Yu Shuxun introduced that through innovative breeding ideas, a new line of land cotton, "Chinese cotton 619," with special early maturity, salt and alkali resistance, low temperature resistance and high yield, was developed.
"Under the condition of film-free cultivation in the southern region of Xinjiang, 'China Cotton 619' has realized a series of supporting measures, such as the matching of film-free seeding machinery, the improvement of seeding depth, the shallow burial of drip belt under film-free conditions, the screening of suitable seeding density and reasonable chemical control."
At present, a film-free cotton demonstration base has been set up in Aksu, Kurl and Alar, with a yield of 4,800 kg per hectare.
The cultivation of cotton without film has achieved high yield, cost-saving, environmental protection and improved comprehensive benefits.
Zhang Donghai, an agronomist at the Agricultural Science Institute of the Third Division of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, said that through the research and demonstration of film-free cotton cultivation technology in the past six years, the yield of film-free cotton seed cotton can completely achieve a yield of 320 kg to 350 kg per mu, and may even be higher.
"There is a great prospect for the popularization of film-free cotton cultivation technology."
Zhang Donghai believes that at present, the film-free cotton cultivation technology can completely solve the problem of soil residual film pollution, but there is still a certain gap between the economic benefits and the film cultivation at present.
"The support of the purchase price of cotton will be beneficial to the promotion in the future."
Yu Shuxun said that in the next step, he and his team will continue to carry out in-depth research and widespread application of film-free cotton, make the industry of film-free cotton bigger and stronger, and thoroughly solve the problem of soil pollution caused by film.
Guangdong Sea, Land and Air Actively Responding to the National Day Golden Week Transport - China New Network
On September 29, the seventh day of the official opening of the Hong Kong section of the high-speed railway and the first weekend after its opening, there was a large crowd at the West Kowloon Station.
As the National Day Golden Week (October 1-7) holiday is approaching, over the past few days, journalists have learned from relevant departments that Guangdong railway, aviation, water transport and highway transport departments have actively planned to increase capacity input and put in place various safeguard measures to make every effort to ensure the safe and orderly transportation of passengers within the territory during the Golden Week.

Guangzhou Baiyun Airport may become the busiest airport in the Mainland during the National Day Golden Week this year. It is expected to pick up more than 1.4 million passengers and take off and land more than 9,200 flights.
With more and more international routes, the airport expects that the significant growth of international passengers will be a prominent feature of this year's Golden Week holiday compared with the past.
It is understood that Singapore, Bangkok, Phuket, Jakarta, Colombo, Maldives and Manila are all popular cities for this year's National Day holiday. Kathmandu, Kuala Lumpur and Bali also continue to be popular tourist destinations, and some flights are "hard to get one vote."
Some airlines have especially increased their operating flights, such as: Shenzhen Airlines added one Guangzhou-Hanoi flight every day; Iran Mahan Airlines added one Guangzhou-Tehran flight every Saturday; and Vietnam Viet Jet Airlines added one Guangzhou-Hanoi flight every Tuesday and Thursday.
In order to do a good job of holiday protection, Baiyun Airport has increased the protection of key posts such as "seat allocation," "baggage protection," "check-in service," "passenger security check," and made preparations for the disposal of large-scale flight delays.
According to China Southern Airlines, the routes to Australia, New Zealand, North America and Japan and South Korea during the National Day Golden Week this year are very hot, while flights to Hainan, Chengdu, Luzhou, Jiuhuashan, Anshan and Huangshan and other mainland Chinese tourist destinations are also relatively tight.
China Southern Airlines plans to add 50 flights during the Golden Week, including 10 flights on the route between Guangzhou and Chiang Mai.
According to the Guangdong Maritime Bureau, the safety risks of key vessels such as water-based tourist boats, Qiongzhou Strait passenger ferries, Pearl River Estuary high-speed passenger ships and ferry ferries were strictly investigated before the festival to ensure the stability of the water traffic security situation during the long holiday period.
During the Golden Week, the traffic volume of Guangdong Province is expected to be firmly at the top of China.
The Guangdong Provincial Transportation Group recently issued travel guidelines for the holiday expressway. The traffic flow of the expressway is expected to increase by about 12%.
The General Administration of Market Supervision recently issued the "Notice on Strengthening the Supervision of Market Prices during the National Day of the Mid-Autumn Festival in 2018," which requires that the supervision of prices in the field of housing rental and real estate should be strengthened, and that price violations such as rent price collusion, hoarding of rental housing sources, fabricating and hyping false information to bid up rents, charging fees indiscriminately by means of bundling services, publishing misleading price information and unclear pricing should be strictly rectified.
The notice makes it clear that it is necessary to strengthen price monitoring and early warning and pay close attention to market price dynamics.
All localities should pay close attention to the daily necessities such as grain, oil, meat, poultry, eggs, vegetable milk and salt with large consumption, as well as the market and price changes of the special commodities consumed by local residents during the holidays, and strengthen price monitoring and analysis and early warning.
Once the tendency and incipient problems of market fluctuations are found, timely measures are taken to effectively resolve them.
It is necessary to strengthen the supervision and inspection of the wholesale and retail links of daily necessities, increase the frequency and supervision of places closely related to the daily consumption of the people, such as the Shang Chao and the farmers' market, and urge business operators to abide by the law and operate in good faith.
The circular points out that it is necessary to strengthen inspection in key areas to create a good holiday consumption environment; strengthen the supervision of gate ticket prices in state-owned scenic spots; and focus on investigating and dealing with illegal violations such as the failure of state-owned scenic spots to implement the price level or floating range set by the government, the unauthorized addition of fee items, the disguised increase of gate ticket prices through the illegal establishment of "garden garden" tickets, high pricing and large discounts, bundling sales, failure to specify price according to regulations, non-implementation of preferential measures, extra-price increases and compulsory collection of fees.
The circular requires that the supervision of the prices of daily necessities, especially agricultural products, should be strengthened.
Affected by seasonal changes, natural disasters and sudden outbreaks, recently, the prices of agricultural products such as vegetables and pork, which are essential for life, have fluctuated in some areas.
All localities should, in the light of the actual local conditions, earnestly strengthen the market price supervision of agricultural and sideline products, cooperate with relevant departments to do a good job in stabilizing production and market supply, and organize forces to carry out key market inspections and random spot checks.
We will increase the frequency of inspection of pork and other commodities whose supply is tight and prices are rising rapidly, and seriously investigate and deal with illegal acts such as hoarding, bidding up prices and colluding to raise prices.
The notice points out that price supervision in the field of housing leasing and real estate should be strengthened.
The Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day coincide with the peak season of housing rental and commercial housing sales. All localities should pay close attention to the price behavior of real estate enterprises, intermediary companies and housing rental-related enterprises. We will strictly rectify price violations such as collusion in rent prices, hoarding rental housing sources, fabricating and hyping false information to bid up rents, charging fees indiscriminately in the form of bundling services, publishing misleading price information and unclear pricing. We will intensify the inspection of the clearly marked prices of hot-selling properties and real estate agents, investigate and deal with acts that harm the interests of consumers and disrupt market order, such as the failure to implement "one set of standards" in accordance with the regulations, purify the real estate market environment and create an open and transparent price order in the real estate market.
The circular mentioned that all localities should earnestly do a good job in the price supervision of other links of the tourism industry, focus on standardizing the price order of catering, accommodation, shopping, sightseeing, entertainment and parking, guide operators to do a good job in the publicity of clearly marked prices and fees, and seriously investigate and deal with all kinds of price violations.
The circular states that it is necessary to strengthen the inspection of transport prices such as roads, railways, civil aviation and water transport, and seriously investigate and deal with illegal acts such as illegal price increases, extra-price charges and failure to clearly mark prices in accordance with the regulations.
We will implement the "green channel" for the transportation of fresh agricultural products and the policy of waiving the tolls of small passenger cars on major holidays.
It is necessary to innovate regulatory means and working methods, strengthen the publicity of price laws and regulations for online and offline commodity retail enterprises and e-commerce platforms, urge business operators to improve price promotion schemes, and investigate and deal with illegal acts such as fictitious original prices, misleading price indications and non-compliance with price commitments in accordance with the law.

The reporter learned from the Ministry of Finance on the 30th day that the four departments of the Ministry of Finance, the State Administration of Taxation, the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Commerce jointly issued a notice recently. In order to further encourage overseas investors to invest in China, the scope of application of the policy of withholding income tax for domestic direct investment is extended from foreign investment incentive projects to all non-prohibited foreign investment projects and fields.
This policy will be implemented from January 1, 2018.
The circular makes it clear that direct investment by overseas investors with profit-sharing includes equity investment activities such as capital increase, new construction and equity acquisition by overseas investors with profit-sharing, but does not include the addition, transfer and acquisition of shares of listed companies other than qualified strategic investment.
If an overseas investor may, in accordance with the relevant provisions, enjoy the policy of withholding income tax for the time being but does not actually enjoy it, he may apply for retroactive enjoyment of the policy within three years from the date of actual payment of the relevant tax and return the tax paid.
Moreover, after foreign investors enjoy the prescribed treatment of temporary non-collection of advance income tax policy, if the reorganization of the invested enterprises meets the conditions of special reorganization and actually carries out tax treatment in accordance with the special reorganization, they may continue to enjoy the treatment of temporary non-collection of advance income tax policy.
In order to ensure that the profits earned by overseas investors are actually used for direct investment, the notice stipulates that if the profits used by overseas investors for direct investment are paid in the form of cash, the relevant funds are transferred directly from the account of the profit distribution enterprise to the account of the invested enterprise or the equity transferor, and may not be turned over in other accounts at home and abroad before direct investment. If the profits used by overseas investors for direct investment are paid in the form of physical objects, negotiable securities and other non-cash forms, the ownership of the relevant assets is transferred directly from the profit distribution enterprise or the equity transferor may not be held by other enterprises or individuals on their behalf or temporarily before direct investment.
The circular also requires the tax authorities to strengthen follow-up management in accordance with the law.
If an overseas investor has enjoyed the policy of not collecting advance income tax for the time being and fails to meet the prescribed conditions after subsequent management verification by the tax department, it is deemed that the overseas investor has not declared and paid enterprise income tax in accordance with the relevant provisions, except that it is the responsibility of the profit distribution enterprise, and the liability for delayed tax payment will be investigated in accordance with the law. The period of delayed tax payment shall be calculated from the date of payment of the relevant profits.

Former Foreign Aid Allegations of Playing Fake Ball North Control Response "Must Have" - CNN.com
Yesterday afternoon, the Beijing Holding Football Club (hereinafter referred to as the North Control) made an official response to the news that the former foreign aid of the team, Anichebe, accused the team of allegedly kicking a fake ball. The North Control side issued a statement saying that there was absolutely no case of kicking a fake ball on the part of the club, which was entirely a lie fabricated by Anichebe himself in the course of arbitration in order to cover up his flagrant violation of the contract agreement and for his personal improper economic purposes.
At the same time, North Control said it would reserve the right to pursue the responsibility of the relevant parties by all means.
According to the Daily Mail, Nigerian player Anichebe alleged to FIFA that the Beijing North Control Team, which he played last year, was suspected of playing fake ball, including the Beijing Derby in the 21st round of the 2017 season.
At that time, it was the key stage of the Beijingers and the Chong Chao. In that game, the North Control finally lost 0-2 to the Beijingers and Anichebi made his debut.
In response to the Nigerian player's statement, the North Control Club made an official response yesterday.
According to the statement, after the club's previous internal investigation, there was no case of playing fake ball in the games in which the team participated.
Anichebe joined Beijing North Control in June 2017. In December of the same year, Anichebe refused to return to the team for winter training without good reason, and still refused to return to the team despite repeated reminders from the club.
At present, the dispute between the two sides has been submitted to FIFA and arbitration is under way.
The statement also mentioned that the high-profile "fake ball allegation" is actually a lie fabricated by Anichebe in the course of arbitration in order to cover up his flagrant violation of the contract agreement and for his personal improper economic purposes.
Its sole purpose of slandering the club and slandering Chinese football is to obtain illegitimate economic benefits.
Even more, the club does not accept any organization or any individual to make groundless accusations, slander, slander and slander against the club for the sake of their economic interests and personal enmity.
Therefore, the North Control said that it would reserve the right to pursue the responsibility of the relevant parties by all means.

Chinese journalists were taken away by the police at the annual meeting of the British Conservative Party. China demands an apology
According to the website of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom, a spokesman of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom answered questions on Monday about a Chinese journalist who was taken away by the police during the annual meeting of the British Conservative Party.
The spokesman pointed out that we asked the Conservative Human Rights Committee to stop interfering in China's internal affairs and stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs, and asked the conference organizers to apologize to Chinese journalists.
A reporter asked: On September 30, during the annual meeting of the British Conservative Party, the party's Human Rights Committee held a side meeting on the Hong Kong issue and invited the Hong Kong opposition to speak at the meeting.
During the side meeting, a Chinese journalist was taken away by the police.
Do you have any comment?
In response, the spokesman said that in the 21 years since Hong Kong's return to the motherland, the practice of "one country, two systems" has achieved great success and Hong Kong's development achievements are universally recognized.
Hong Kong is China's Hong Kong and Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs.
The Conservative Human Rights Committee used the party's annual conference to hold a side meeting to open the eyes of anti-China separatist forces. China expressed serious concern and strong dissatisfaction.
We firmly oppose any interference in Hong Kong affairs by any person or organization in any way.
Any attempt and act advocating "Hong Kong independence" is futile.
The spokesman said that the UK has always touted freedom of expression, but when Chinese journalists asked questions to express their views at the side meeting, they were obstructed and even physically violated, which is totally unacceptable.
We ask the Conservative Human Rights Committee to stop interfering in China's internal affairs, stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs and ask the conference organizers to apologize to Chinese journalists.

The railway department reminded the vast number of passengers and friends that during the festive period, passengers who have successfully booked through the Internet and telephone but have not yet collected their tickets should collect their tickets in advance as far as possible. When travelling, please bring their tickets and valid identity documents consistent with the ticket information, and reserve sufficient time to collect tickets, security check, check tickets and transfer so as not to delay their journey.
In a speech to the US Foreign Relations Committee on Friday, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that at present, China-US relations have once again reached a crossroads. If the two sides can look at each other in a positive and inclusive manner, expand and deepen positive cooperation and properly manage differences and contradictions, they can open up better prospects.
"China-US relations are our common asset and we need to take care of them together."
He expressed the hope that people of insight from all walks of life of the two countries will take concrete actions to maintain the healthy and stable development of China-US relations and jointly push forward China-US relations in the right direction.
Wang Yi also stressed once again that China will surely follow a different development path from that of the traditional big countries.
This road with Chinese characteristics determines that China will not and cannot repeat the mistakes of national strength and hegemony, and that China will neither become the United States, challenge the United States, nor replace the United States.
In his speech entitled "Opportunity or Challenge, Partner or Opposition," Wang Yi said that the deep-seated crux of the current problem lies in the fact that some American friends believe that China will also be a strong and powerful country and will even challenge and replace the leading position of the United States in the world.
"This is clearly a major strategic miscalculation."
But this kind of self-imagined suspicion is spreading, amplifying the existing contradictions, giving rise to new doubts, and making it more difficult and encountering more resistance to solve specific problems between China and the United States, he said.
Wang Yi pointed out that China is following a path of peaceful development.
The Chinese have never had a gene for external expansion.
We believe that all countries can live together in harmony and exchange and learn from each other.
Whether in the past, now or in the future, China will neither copy the foreign model nor ask other countries to copy China's practices.
Earlier, when Wang Yi met with former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in New York, he said that China-US cooperation will win-win and confrontation will inevitably lose.
China has always been committed to the development of long-term, healthy and stable China-US relations and the realization of non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation.
China's State New Office held a press conference on Tuesday to introduce and interpret the white paper "Facts on Sino-US Economic and Trade Frictions and China's Position."
Fu Ziying, Vice Minister of Commerce of China, said at the conference that China is willing to make efforts to promote the development of bilateral trade in a more balanced direction, and hopes that the US side will also show a positive attitude.
On October 1, according to foreign media, the Indonesian island of Sulawesi was hit by a strong earthquake and tsunami on September 28, causing serious damage to several cities along the coast. The latest news shows that the number of people killed has increased to 1,200.
It is reported that the town of Donggala, near the epicenter of the earthquake, was hit by two rounds of tsunami. As the "golden 72 hours" of rescue passed, the authorities believe that the number of people killed will continue to rise.
Rescuers carry an earthquake survivor rescued from under the rubble of a restaurant in Palu, Central Sulawesi Province, Indonesia, September 30, 2018.
Officials of the disaster relief department said that the huge waves brought by the tsunami were as high as 6 meters, and the scope of the impact of the earthquake and tsunami exceeded people's original estimates.
It is reported that at the time of the earthquake and tsunami, hundreds of people were celebrating the festival on the beach in Palu, and many people were swept away by huge waves and lost their lives.
Officials said that the tsunami came ashore at a speed of 800 kilometers per hour, and many buildings and infrastructure were destroyed.
He said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed, and the mudslide caused by the tsunami cut off a major highway in Palu.
A bridge across a coastal river collapsed in Sulawesi.
On September 30, local time, Indonesian President Joko visited the city of Central Sulawesi Palu, where the earthquake occurred.
Indonesian President Joko visited the disaster area on September 30 and said that he had sent troops to assist in search and rescue and called on the victims to be patient.
Joko pointed out that the rescue operation was very difficult because of the shortage of heavy machinery and manpower.
He learned that there was a lack of water, food, fuel and other materials in many parts of the disaster area, and that many merchants had closed down after the earthquake and had sent aircraft to drop materials.
He appealed to the victims to be patient and stay in their original position waiting for rescue.
Search and rescue workers in the city of Palu said they heard a call for help from a collapsed hotel in the city, but they were helpless because there was no heavy machine to remove the rubble, and some people needed to save people with their bare hands.
Indonesian Vice President Kara said that the cut-off of power and communications in some areas led to the lack of information, and the death toll caused by the earthquake and tsunami could eventually rise to thousands.
Shenyang, November 5 (reporter Xu Zhiqiang Correspondent Yan Yina) The reporter learned today from the meeting of the Liaoning Provincial Court to basically solve the implementation difficulties, that during the six-month "Storm" campaign, the Liaoning Provincial Court severely cracked down on the refusal to carry out the act, transferred a total of 241 people who refused to carry out the crime, and maintained the high-pressure situation of cracking down on the refusal to carry out the law and crime.
It is understood that, according to the unified deployment of the Liaoning High Court, from the beginning of April to the end of September, the Liaoning court launched a six-month campaign to basically solve the implementation of the difficult "storm," gathering superior forces and launching an all-round general attack on the basic solution of the implementation difficulties.
At the same time, the provincial courts have organized and carried out the "five batch" activities of fining a batch, detaining a batch, restricting consumption, punishing a batch for breach of trust and transferring a batch of refusing to commit crimes in accordance with the law.
At the beginning of the activity, there were more than 132,000 outstanding execution cases in the provincial courts. At the end of July, the case was cleared to the bottom.
During the activities, the provincial courts fined the executed persons a total of 12.0607 million yuan, detained 4,146 people, restricted consumption of 162,844 people, punished 55,128 people for breach of trust and transferred 241 people for refusing to commit crimes.

"Where can I take a taxi?
We want to go to Golden Bauhinia Square to see the National Day flag-raising ceremony!
When Mr. and Mrs. Song, who deliberately flew from Ningxia to Shenzhen and transferred to Shenzhen for the first bus on the National Day of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong High-Speed Railway, were interviewed by a reporter from the China News Agency at the West Kowloon Station in Hong Kong on the morning of October 1, they made enquiries to the reporter.
On the morning of October 1, to celebrate the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region held a grand flag-raising ceremony at Golden Bauhinia Square.
According to the statistics of the immigration control points, as at September 30, the number of passengers entering Hong Kong via the High Speed Rail West Kowloon Station had exceeded 300,000.
On the occasion of the 69th anniversary of the motherland, the West Kowloon Border Inspection Station expects that there will be a peak of visitors to Hong Kong on October 1 and 2.
The reporter saw at the arrival hall at around 7 a.m. on Monday that many mainland tourists took advantage of the National Day Golden Week to take high-speed rail and visit Hong Kong.
Mrs. Song, who is light-footed, told reporters that the National Day holiday is a rare long holiday in a year. It has always been her wish to come to Hong Kong Golden Bauhinia Square to see the raising of the flag. She felt particularly happy and excited to achieve this wish on the National Day.
However, at present, the flights to and from Hong Kong in Ningxia are inconvenient. Fortunately, the Hong Kong section of the high-speed railway is open to traffic. After inquiring about the train schedule, Mr. Song found that the first bus can arrive at 7: 3 a.m. and connect the city transport to Golden Bauhinia Square. The time is just good.
He sighed with the reporter: "The high-speed railway is really too convenient, fast and accurate!"
The daily 70 one-hour short-distance trains to and from Guangzhou South, Shenzhen North and Futian and West Kowloon have greatly facilitated the entry of residents from the Tai Wan area of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao to Hong Kong.
After his arrival in Hong Kong, Mr. Liu, who lives in Shenzhen, is preparing to go to the Central Peak to meet his Hong Kong friends.
Mr. Liu said, "The Mainland and Hong Kong are on holiday on National Day. We intend to challenge ourselves to see if we can walk the 50-kilometer Hong Kong Island Trail!"
He explained that if it were not for the opening of the high-speed railway, convenient communication and sufficient time, they would not dare to try such a long-distance mountain travel.
Mrs. Yang from Dongguan came to Hong Kong to participate in the piano competition with her 10-year-old son on the high-speed railway. She proudly told the reporter that her son had studied the piano for three years and that it was meaningful to spend the National Day in this way.
Before coming to Hong Kong, she had been taking a bus, but it was time-consuming and energy-consuming. She was worried about affecting her son's state. This time, she came by high-speed railway through Shenzhen. The customs clearance was convenient and the time used was halved. She was even more impressed by the trip of the Hong Kong section. She said to the reporter, "It seems that I took the subway, especially fast, and I arrived before I could take a photo!"
On September 23, at 6: 44, the G5711 "Harmony" high-speed train set off from the Shenzhen North Station and sped along the way. A few minutes later, the train entered the Hong Kong section of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong high-speed railway, which is the first officially operated high-speed train to be welcomed by the Hong Kong section.
The Hong Kong section of the high-speed railway, which is integrated into the country's 25,000 km high-speed rail network and reaches 38 long-distance stations throughout the country, also welcomes Mainland visitors from different provinces in the north and south of the country.
Mr. Gao, who came to visit his family from Changsha on a small long vacation, told reporters that before, the high-speed railway could only travel to the north of Shenzhen, take the subway to cross Hong Kong and then travel around the city. The transfer was troublesome and time-consuming. Now, he can sit directly in the Kowloon Center and eat the lunch made by his children when he gets home. He felt very happy.
He said that the convenience of the customs clearance procedure of "one place and two checks" is beyond imagination. "In less than 10 minutes, both gates have passed."
The West Kowloon Station, which is adjacent to the Airport Express and connects land and air traffic, has also become the first choice for many transit passengers.
Miss Wu from Fujian was going to spend the Golden Week with her friends from Hong Kong to the Philippines. When she left the gate on time in West Kowloon, she pushed her luggage and said to the reporter, "I was afraid that she would not be able to catch the plane. I didn't expect it to be so fast. There is more than enough time!"
According to the subsidiary arrangement of the trade agreement announced on Monday, the new US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement will retain the ability of US President Donald Trump to implement the threat of imposing a 25% tariff on imported cars, while at the same time making passenger cars, pickup trucks and auto parts imported from Canada and Mexico basically exempt from paying customs duties.
If Trump imposes a so-called "Chapter 232" tariff on cars for national security reasons, both Mexico and Canada will have a quota of 2.6 million passenger vehicles exported to the United States each year that are exempt from tax.
According to the subsidiary arrangement, the pickup trucks produced in the two countries will be fully exempted from customs duties.
If Trump imposes auto tariffs, Mexico will receive a tax exemption quota of US $108 billion per year for auto parts, and Canada will receive a quota of US $32.4 billion.
Both quotas are much higher than the current production levels of the two countries, providing room for the growth of their exports.
Washington / Mexico September 28 - Mexico said Friday that after several days of debate, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and Canada are making practical efforts to resolve their trade policy differences, raising expectations that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is expected to maintain the form of a three-way agreement.
Despite the lack of details, the above-mentioned obvious progress is enough to prompt the governments of Mexico and the United States to suddenly stop their plans to publish the text of the trade agreement between the two sides and give Canada more time to join the agreement.
Mexican President-designate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told reporters in Mexico that the U.S. government has put forward new counter-proposals to the Canadian government and said he will continue to press for all three countries to participate in NAFTA.
Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said that the submission of the text of the US-Mexico trade agreement to Mexican and US legislation was delayed because the Canadian and US governments tried to reach an agreement "very seriously."
"In the next 48 hours, we will know whether we will reach a text of the tripartite agreement or have to publish the text of the agreement between the two sides," Guajardo said.
Guajardo said that his counterparts in the United States and Canada "specifically requested" that the release of the text be delayed.
A spokesman for the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) did not comment on the text of the trade agreement between the United States and Mexico and the consultations between the United States and Canada.
Officials from the Office of the Prime Minister and the Office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Canada did not respond to requests for comment on the counter-proposal.
According to foreign media reports, two young lions play together in a conservation center on the outskirts of Pretoria, the capital of South Africa. It is hard to see anything unusual, but they are unique.
"This is the first lion cub ever born by artificial insemination - the first pair in the world," announced the University of Pretoria.
On-campus scientists are working to study the reproductive system of female African lions.
Ganswint, director of the Mammal Research Institute of the University of Pretoria, said that the two cubs born on August 25, one female and one male, were quite healthy and normal.
His team finally reached the breakthrough after 18 months of intensive experiment.
"We collected sperm from a healthy male lion," Ganswint said during a media interview.
Next, the researchers carried out artificial insemination for the lioness when the hormone content in her body reached an appropriate level.
"Fortunately, it turned out to be a success," Mr Ganswint said.
He said that the researchers "made several attempts, but unexpectedly, it did not take much effort."
He said that the above-mentioned research breakthrough can be verified repeatedly, and scientists hope to use this technology to save endangered large cats.
According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, lions have become extinct in 26 countries in Africa, and the total number of surviving wild lions has dropped by 43% in the past 20 years, leaving only about 20,000.
The African lion is listed as a vulnerable animal by this organization.
"If we don't do something about this animal, they will face extinction," Ganswint said.
He said that the new technology did not need to allow lions to be raised, but simply injected sperm into a fertile lioness, just like the practice of captive elephants in North America and Europe.
The decline in South Korea's exports in September was the largest in more than two years, but analysts attributed the decline to fewer working days and said that global demand for South Korean goods remained strong despite the rising trade tensions between China and the United States.
Indeed, South Korea's average daily exports increased last month.
In addition, the initial data released earlier showed a double-digit increase in exports in the first weeks of September before the long holiday.
The year-on-year decline of South Korea's exports in September was the largest since July 2016, and the decline was larger than the 5.7% decline estimated by 11 analysts surveyed by Reuters.
The initial value released on Monday showed that the export value in September was US $50.6 billion, down from US $51.2 billion in August.
Although worried that the growing US-China trade dispute may lead to the suffering of other export-dependent Chinese neighbors, South Korea's exports to China increased by 7.8% in September, expanding for the 23rd consecutive month.
South Korea's exports to the United States declined by 11.8% due to the decline in the sale of petroleum products.
The overseas sales of Korean memory chips and petroleum products increased by 28.3% and 13.5% respectively, although the market is concerned that the so-called "super cycle" of chips may have peaked.
"However, the impact of trade conflicts will be difficult to avoid, as South Korea's exports depend on the US and Chinese markets to a considerable extent."
Imports fell by 2.1% to US $40.8 billion, which is also less than the 3.1% increase estimated by the Reuters survey.
The initial value of the trade surplus in September was $9.7 billion, up from $6.9 billion in August.
According to the Ministry of Industry, thanks to the United States and European Union countries, the global manufacturing industry will remain prosperous, which is a favorable factor for South Korea's exports.
"The increase in export prices caused by the rise in oil prices will also be beneficial to exports in the second half of this year," the statement noted.
"However, the continuation of the trade conflict between the United States and China, coupled with the increased market volatility after the US interest rate rise, is a negative pressure on exports."
The average export per working day rose to US $2.6 billion in September and US $2.1 billion in August.
South Korea's Mid-Autumn Festival falls on September 24-26 this year, so there are only 19.5 working days in September, four days less than the same period last year.
South Korea's exports grew by 4.7% from January to September compared with the same period last year.
According to the Nikkei / Markit Purchasing Managers' Index, South Korea's manufacturing activity picked up in September, but was supported by domestic orders, as orders from China and Japan fell, which threatened to cloud the outlook for other exports.
North Korean media criticized the United States for not easing sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
The DPRK's Rodong Sinmun published an op-ed article on September 30, criticizing the United States for not easing sanctions against the DPRK while seeking dialogue with the DPRK, calling it a "contradictory" practice.
The article said that US Secretary of State Pompeo said on Thursday that "in order to realize the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, the key is to implement the sanctions against the DPRK," stressing that the US position of continuing to implement the UN sanctions resolution remains unchanged.
In the Singapore DPRK-US Joint Statement, the two sides pledged to establish new DPRK-US relations commensurate with the aspirations of the Korean and American peoples for peace and prosperity.
It is undoubtedly contradictory for the United States to increase sanctions and pressure while calling for dialogue.
The article said that if we want to establish new DPRK-US relations, build a permanently consolidated peace system on the Korean Peninsula and realize the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, we should put the building of trust in the first place and solve it in stages one by one, starting with what can be done.
The article also said that the United States should understand that sanctions and repression will not work for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The article said that even the "North Devonsk" before the "Kazan" was praised by the US military.
The National Interest magazine quoted the US Navy as saying: "We will meet a strong potential adversary. It is enough to look at the North Devonsk submarine."
Fugo, the current commander-in-chief of the US Navy in Europe, also praised the North Devonsk submarine.
"This submarine is impressive. If you look at the development of the Russian navy and how to use its resources, you will know that its main efforts in research and development are first and foremost to strengthen the submarine fleet," he said.
But the National Interest magazine still believes that the United States maintains an advantage over Russia in this field.
"I believe that Western countries still have asymmetric advantages," Fugo said.
It was previously reported that the Russian Navy will install the Kazan submarine in 2019.
The multi-purpose submarines "Kazan," "Novosibirsk," "Krasnoyarsk" and "Arkhangelsk" are all modified "white wax tree-M," with a displacement of 13,800 tons, a depth of 520 meters, a staffing of 64 people and an underwater speed of 31 knots. They will carry mines, torpedoes and "caliber" and "onyx" cruise missiles.

The circular requires that the administrative departments of radio and television at all levels should deal with all kinds of illegal advertisements found in the supervision and inspection in strict accordance with the "Measures for Handling Violations by Radio and Television Broadcasting Agencies" of the General Administration.
If the violation is serious, it shall be dealt with seriously, such as giving admonitions and talks, issuing a notice of criticism, suspending the broadcast of advertisements and even suspending the broadcast of frequency channels, and expose them to the public according to the circumstances.
In recent years, the General Administration of Radio and Television has repeatedly stopped illegal advertisements.
This year, the State Administration of Radio and Television issued a notice to publicly stop advertisements with such serious violations as "0-bubble fruit milk," "Sava cocktail" and "Bonrette plant anti-breeding and dew," which have guiding bias and exaggerate propaganda and mislead the audience.
The General Administration of Radio and Television has formulated a number of regulations and circulars to regulate the advertising behavior of radio and television broadcasting.
The "Notice on Further Strengthening the Administration of TV Shopping Short Film Advertising on TV Channel" stipulates that all TV channels are not allowed to broadcast TV shopping short film advertisements during the period from 18: 00 to 24: 00 every day.
When TV shopping short film advertisements are broadcast at other times, the host shall not be used for publicity, the "hawking type" exaggerated dubbing, intonation and action shall not be used for publicity, and the "orthopaedic," "plastic," "permeable fat" and "fat-throwing" publicity or disguised publicity of breast enhancement and weight loss products shall not be used.

To standardize the form of health information advertising, it is not allowed to publish advertisements in the form of health information special programs.
The special programmes of health information shall focus on the introduction of scientific knowledge such as disease prevention, control and treatment, and shall not contain advertising contents such as medical treatment, drugs, medical devices and health food, and shall not be certified in the names of patients and doctors, pharmacists and experts.
"For the first time, we adjusted the format of the MAKS International Air and Space Salon. We suggested that China should be the main guest country. The Chinese counterparts agreed and accepted our invitation," Manturov said.
Not long ago, Chinese President Xi Jinping attended the Fourth Eastern Economic Forum at the invitation of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
This is the first time that he has attended the forum.
Ignore the threat of the United States!
The EU may conclude a crude oil purchase agreement with Iran
The US government has announced that it will resume a new round of sanctions against Iran in November, and even urged other countries to reduce their imports of Iranian oil.
However, America's allies do not seem to be listening.
According to the New York Times, on 29 September, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif revealed that Tehran is close to reaching an agreement with the European Union on the sale of crude oil, despite the threat of the United States to sanction any country doing business with Iran.
The core purpose of this agreement is to try to establish a new payment mechanism, which is to replace US dollar transactions by barter or local currency.
The purpose of this method is to hope to bypass the United States and prevent the United States from obstructing financial transfer.
At the same time, while the EU is committed to the promotion of the agreement, some French and British officials are also concerned that if the agreement is realized, it will be the most open confrontation between the EU and the United States, which opposes the withdrawal of the United States from the Iran nuclear agreement.
The US media said that during the one-hour interview, Zarif's words sounded more optimistic than in recent months.
Because the agreement has the ability to "divest" the traditional allies of the United States and effectively break the US attempt to reduce Iran's income.
"This will ensure that we sell oil and benefit from it," Zarif said, arguing that according to the agreement reached in 2015, countries have the legal right to trade with Iran.
The European Union's foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, also said recently that "no sovereign country or organization can accept other people to decide who they can trade with."
However, she also predicted that before the US government launched the next step of sanctions in November, it would be possible for US leaders to adopt a series of financial measures aimed at targeting banks, businessmen and countries that have business dealings with Tehran.
In May this year, the US government unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement on the grounds that the agreement was flawed, and said that the agreement could not permanently prohibit Iran from producing nuclear fuel.
The United States then threatened to ban companies that purchase Iranian oil and other commodities from doing business in the United States.
This threat led to the withdrawal of some companies from Tehran and the collapse of the Iranian currency.
Companies such as Airbus and French oil giant Total have cancelled billions of dollars of investment in Iraq.
British and French officials have said that the US government may "gain the upper hand."
Sure enough, according to a recent report in the Turkish media, the US sanctions do not seem to have had a great impact on Iran's oil exports.
Iranian Oil Minister Zanganeh has revealed that no country other than South Korea has stopped buying Iranian oil.
Both Zarif and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani believe that the purpose of a series of US actions is to "entice" Iran to violate the agreement.
Zarif also shrugged off a series of verbal attacks by the US side. When asked whether the US would overthrow the current Iranian government with increasing financial pressure, Zarif even laughed. "It is a strategy of regime change, which is the real purpose of the US side."
"Revisiting the Battery to Remember Fanghua": The Opening of the Cultural Tourism Market of the Hulishan Battery in Xiamen
In that year, old man Chen Feifei, the first announcer of Fujian Front Radio Station to broadcast Minnan Mandarin, came to the Battery to recall and tell the history of the Battery.
The famous tourist scenic spot and the Hulishan Battery Scenic Area in Xiamen, which is separated from Jinmen by water, was once the home of the "front-line broadcasting station" set up by the Chinese People's Liberation Army.
On the 30th day of the 60th anniversary of the establishment of the "Front-line Broadcasting Station," the scenic spot held a "Revisit to the Battery to Remember Fanghua," inviting several historical witnesses of the front-line broadcasting stations of that year to talk about the historical changes of the Battery and witness the development and changes of cross-Straits relations.
In that year, the historical witness of the front-line broadcasting station told the history of the Battery.
This is one of the second series of "Xiamen Hulishan Battery Cultural Tourism Market" created by the Hulishan Scenic Area.
Previously, the first event was successfully held here to create an exclusive cultural tourism brand activity that integrates cultural tourism IP, creative market and traditional folk culture experience.
On the same day, under the guidance of the Xiamen Tourism Commission, the second cultural tourism market of the "Ancient Battery ・ New Era" hosted by the Hulishan Battery Scenic Area of Xiamen officially opened. During the six-day event, the main theme of the "happy reunion" will be the Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day, so that the people who come to visit will experience the rich Minnan customs in the "eating" "tourism" and "buying" entertainment. "
"Hearing the sound of the sea" concert has become a major focus of the Battery cultural tourism market.
Wang Yong, director of the Hulishan Battery Management Office, said that the "Revisit Battery to Remember Fanghua" event held to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the opening of the front-line broadcasting station of the Hulishan Battery of the People's Liberation Army, invited several old broadcasters of the Battery to tell the history of the Battery and let people remember the past extraordinary years together.
In addition, the tourism market series also includes the choral concert activities on the 40th anniversary of the reform and opening-up, the selection of old photos and the public welfare exhibition of the large-scale single art installation of "Rabbit Little Princess" on both sides of the Taiwan Straits in 2018.
Among them, the "Hear the Sound of the Sea" concert, as a major focus of the Battery Cultural Tourism Market, is an exclusive cultural brand activity created by the scenic area. It invited the Fenghuanghua Women's Choir of Xiamen Youth Palace to lend its full support and sing a choral concert on the 40th anniversary of reform and opening-up at the ancient Battery accompanying the sea in Yishan, showing the collision and integration of the "ancient Battery" and the "new era."
The public welfare exhibition of the large-scale single art installation of "Rabbit Little Princess" on both sides of the Straits was launched in the Battery Scenic Area during the National Day, focusing on creating an "eyeball effect," attracting a large number of tourists and citizens to visit and take photos, forwarding friends' circles and shooting jitters, so as to add a "net red" factor to the city of Xiamen.
As for the "Xiamen 40-year-old you and me" - the old photo selection campaign, an exhibition of the winning works is set up in the scenic area to dig deeply into those happy and moving moments through a photo with temperature.
On September 30, the sixth meeting of the Standing Committee of the 13th National People's Congress of Fujian Province voted to adopt the Regulations on the Promotion of the Construction of Ecological Civilization in Fujian Province.
"Green Water Qingshan is Jinshan Yinshan" was written into the legislation of Fujian Province for the first time, running through the whole regulation and becoming an operational and enforceable regulation.
Fujian is the first national ecological civilization experimental area in China.
According to the head of the Legal Affairs Office of the Fujian Provincial People's Government, it is necessary and urgent to form a basic law on the construction of ecological civilization from the whole and the overall situation in order to solve the problem of regulating the construction of ecological civilization through scattered laws, regulations and policy documents alone, and also to provide a legal basis for the formulation and promulgation of relevant rules, normative documents and measures.
The Regulations fully reflect the characteristics of Fujian and convert mature experience practices in the practice of ecological civilization construction into legal forms for popularization and implementation: For example, the "Changting experience" formed in the work of water and soil conservation control in Fujian can be replicated and popularized. The Regulations summarize and upgrade the experience of water and soil conservation management in Fujian Province, and stipulate that local people's governments at or above the county level should strengthen the unified leadership of water and soil conservation work and delimit key soil erosion prevention and control areas on the basis of the results of soil erosion investigation. If the river-length system originated in Fujian Province, the regulations raise the river-length system and the lake-length system to the legislative level, stipulating that local people's governments at all levels should implement the river-length system and the lake-length system in an all-round way, and implement the main body, responsibility and funding of river and lake management.
The regulations provide for the implementation of a life-long investigation system for liability for ecological environmental damage.
If anyone violates the requirements of scientific development and causes serious damage to the ecological environment and resources, the major leading cadres and relevant persons-in-charge who bear the leadership responsibility shall be held accountable for life.
According to the report, the "Regulations on the Promotion of the Construction of Ecological Civilization in Fujian Province" will come into force on November 1 this year.

In order to further encourage foreign investors to invest in China, the Ministry of Finance and four other ministries jointly notified that, starting from January 1, 2018, the scope of application of the policy of withholding income tax for domestic direct investment will be extended from foreign investment incentive projects to all non-prohibited foreign investment projects and fields.
According to the relevant notice published on the website of the Ministry of Finance, the temporary non-collection of advance income tax by foreign investors must meet several conditions at the same time, including direct investment by foreign investors with profit-sharing, including equity investment acts such as capital increase, new construction and equity acquisition by foreign investors with profit-sharing, but excluding the addition, transfer and acquisition of shares of listed companies (except qualified strategic investment).
It also includes that the profits earned by overseas investors belong to the equity investment income such as dividends and dividends resulting from the actual distribution of the realized retained earnings to investors by resident enterprises in China.
If the profits used by foreign investors for direct investment are paid in the form of cash, the relevant funds are transferred directly from the account of the profit distribution enterprise to the account of the invested enterprise or the equity transferor, and may not be turned over in other accounts at home and abroad before direct investment. If the profits used by foreign investors for direct investment are paid in the form of physical objects, negotiable securities and other non-cash forms, the ownership of the relevant assets is transferred directly from the profit distribution enterprise to the invested enterprise or the equity transferor may not be held by other enterprises or individuals on their behalf or temporarily before direct investment.
According to the notice, foreign investors actually recover the direct investment enjoying the treatment of the policy of withholding income tax by means of equity transfer, repurchase and liquidation, and report the deferred tax to the tax department in accordance with the prescribed procedures within 7 days after the actual collection of the corresponding amount.
In order to encourage overseas investors to continue to invest and operate in China, four ministries, including the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Commerce, jointly issued a notice at the end of 2017. Starting from January 1, 2017, the profits distributed by overseas investors from resident enterprises in China will be directly invested in incentive investment projects. If they meet the prescribed conditions, the deferred tax policy will be implemented and the advance income tax will not be levied for the time being.
The executive meeting of the State Council of China decided last week to expand the scope of application of the temporary non-collection of advance income tax on foreign reinvestment from encouraging foreign capital projects to all non-prohibited projects and fields, so as to further strengthen the protection of intellectual property rights.
The reporter learned from the National Health and Health Committee that compared with a few decades ago, the incidence of malnutrition among children and adolescents in China has decreased, while the incidence of overweight and obesity has increased significantly.
In this regard, the experts pointed out that the most important idea to maintain a healthy weight is to "cure disease" and vigorously promote scientific fitness and reasonable diet.
According to the "Core Information and Interpretation of Chinese Youth Health Education (2018 Edition)" recently released by the National Health and Health Commission, the key to maintaining a healthy weight is reasonable diet and scientific exercise.
Overweight, obesity and blind weight loss are not conducive to health.
The health hidden danger behind the "little fat pier" should not be ignored.
Ding Gangqiang, director of the Nutrition and Health Institute of the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said that overweight obesity endangers the normal growth and development of adolescents, has a negative impact on their psychology, behavior, cognition and intelligence, and can even lead to high blood pressure, high blood sugar and high blood fat in children.
At the same time, overweight and obesity among adolescents is likely to continue into adulthood, which will increase the risk of chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes in adulthood.
Ding Gangqiang said that the nutrition and health status test of Chinese residents in 2010-2012 showed that the overweight rate of children and adolescents aged 6-17 in China was 9.6 per cent and the obesity rate was 6.4 per cent, which added up to 16 per cent.
At the same time, overweight obesity among children and adolescents shows that boys are higher than girls and urban areas are higher than rural areas, and the rate of overweight obesity has increased significantly in recent decades.
How do teenagers cope with overweight and obesity?
Zhang Li, deputy director of the Scientific Fitness and Health Promotion Research Center of the State General Administration of Sports, pointed out that at present, the main causes of adolescent obesity are excessive calorie intake and insufficient physical activity.
For this simple obesity, we should pay attention to scientific exercise and reasonable diet control.
Zhang Li pointed out that the most important idea to maintain a healthy weight is to "cure diseases." A very important part of this is to carry out all-round popular science education for schools, parents and students, popularize the dangers of overweight and obesity and raise the awareness of prevention among young people.
Adolescents should have regular medical check-ups, monitor growth and development indicators such as height and weight, find out early and scientifically judge whether overweight and obesity problems occur, so as to take timely intervention measures.
For young people who are already overweight and obese, Ding Gangqiang suggested that, in addition to actively and scientifically arranging meals and exercise, young people are in a special physiological stage. They should avoid using starvation or semi-starvation therapy to control and reduce their weight, and should not blindly take weight-loss drugs.
Reuters September 28 - Facebook (FB.O) said Friday that hackers stole the digital landing code, giving them access to nearly 50 million user accounts, which is unprecedented and the most serious security breach in its history.
Facebook, which has more than 2.2 billion monthly users, said it had not yet determined whether the attackers abused any accounts or stole personal information.
The company also did not find the location of the hackers and was not sure whether the hackers targeted specific victims.
Its preliminary analysis shows that this is a large-scale attack.
In a media conference call, Chief Executive Zuckerberg called the incident "really serious."
A spokesman for the company said that his account and that of Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer, were also affected.
Facebook shares fell 2.6% on Friday, dragging down the main stock indexes on Wall Street.
U.S. lawmakers said Friday that the attack could increase calls for data privacy legislation.
"This is yet another sad evidence that Congress needs to take action to protect the privacy and security of social media users," Democratic Senator Mark Warner said in a statement.
Rohit Chopra, a member of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), said on Twitter, 'I hope to get an answer to the Reuters report on the security breach.
Changsha, China New Network September 30 (Zheng Yu Liang Tian Can) September 30 is the fifth anniversary of martyrs in China.
On such a special day, the families of Hunan veterans of the Anti-Japanese War, representatives of the members of the Civil Revolution Party and representatives of the Hunan Veterans' Home and other people from all walks of life came to the "Tang People's Longevity Garden of the Anti-Japanese War Theme Garden" in Changsha City to participate in the collective burial ceremony of Hunan veterans of the Anti-Japanese War on the 2018 Martyrs' Day and send off 10 veterans of the Anti-Japanese War and the partners of four veterans of the Anti-Japanese War.
"The veterans of the Anti-Japanese War are witnesses of China's Anti-Japanese War and are true, vivid and vivid teaching materials of patriotism."
Liu Xiao, former vice-chairman of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said that the patriotic spirit of the veterans of the Anti-Japanese War, who were brave and fearless and gave up their lives to forget themselves, is a valuable spiritual wealth for the contemporary Chinese people.
In his speech, Zhu Jianjun, vice-chairman of the Changsha Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and chairman of the Changsha Municipal Committee of the Civil Revolution, pointed out that in recent years, the "Care for Veterans of the Anti-Japanese War" project has become an excellent brand in the social service work of the Changsha Civil Revolution by providing care services to veterans of the Anti-Japanese War in the form of living allowance, free old-age pension and free burial.
He believes that only by engraving history in his heart can the spirit of the Anti-Japanese War be passed on.
At 11 a.m., in the solemn and heavy sound of music, the people who came to the event stood in silence.
The members of the Tang People's Etiquette Team, dressed in gowns and carrying flowers, took a neat step to see off the partners of 10 anti-war veterans and 4 anti-war veterans in a neat queue.
The people who took part in the activities offered flowers and worshiped for the veterans of the Anti-Japanese War. There were also many children in the crowd who, together with their parents, paid tribute to the heroes of the Anti-Japanese War.
The "Tang People's Longevity Garden ・ Anti-Japanese War Theme Garden" is the first national mausoleum with the theme of the Anti-Japanese War, which was jointly created by the Changsha Municipal Committee of the Civil Revolution and Hunan Tang People's Longevity Garden Co., Ltd., and was completed in 2014.
The first phase of the mausoleum project covers an area of more than 2,000 square meters and is composed of "Hero Immortal Monument," "Victory Square," "Anti-Japanese War Hero Mausoleum" and other parts.
The "Anti-Japanese War Heroes Mausoleum" provides the cemetery behind the Hunan anti-Japanese war heroes free of charge and is praised as "the last military camp of the anti-Japanese war veterans."
Every year before and after the Qingming and National Day, the mausoleum will hold a large-scale public sacrifice and burial ceremony.
Since 2015, seven mass burial ceremonies for anti-war veterans have been held here, and 102 anti-war veterans and their partners have been sleeping here.
The newly revised "Regulations on Navigational Dispatching of the Three Gorges-Gezhouba Water Conservancy Hub" (hereinafter referred to as the "Dispatching Rules") began to be implemented on October 1, and the Three Gorges ship lifter was officially unified with the ship lock after two years of trial navigation.
On the first day of the implementation of the new regulations, the navigation order of the Three Gorges-Gezhouba waters was good.
The Yangtze River Three Gorges Navigation Administration issued the first security inspection plan at 21: 00 on September 30, and conducted security inspection on 160 ships. A total of 124 ships passed the security inspection.
At 14: 00 on October 1, the navigation department arranged the first crossing plan after the implementation of the new regulations.
After the implementation of the new regulations, the security inspection plan will be issued once a day at 9: 00 and 21: 00, and the dam crossing plan will be issued once a day at 14: 00 and 20: 00, so that ships can flexibly arrange the dam crossing plan.
The Dispatch Regulations have added the principle of "classified control" for ship over-dam scheduling. According to the functional positioning of the ship lock and the ship lifter, the priority order of the ship over-dam is clearly defined, and the short-term passenger ship over-lock is adjusted to the same priority level as the demonstration ship and the good faith ship.
This is also the second anniversary of the trial operation of the ship lifter, which is officially unified with the ship lock.
For the first time, the Chuanjiang River and the Three Gorges Reservoir Area large, long and wide demonstration ships and new energy-powered ships also rank among the priority grades.
At the same time, the Dispatch Regulations adjusted the "navigable dispatch management waters" from the previous 180 km near-dam waters to 541.8 km from the Yunyang Yangtze River Bridge to the Shitou Yangtze River Bridge, and divided into "core waters, near-dam waters, control waters and dispatch waters."
This will help the ship side to choose suitable waters to be locked and reduce the backlog of ships to be locked in the dam area.
According to the current characteristics of ships crossing dams and waiting for locks, the Dispatch Regulations also put forward good faith restraint measures such as cancellation declaration of vessels violating the regulations and 24-hour delay in crossing dams.
After the water storage of the Three Gorges, the navigation conditions in the reservoir area have been improved, which has promoted the rapid development of shipping on the Yangtze River.
The data show that the annual cargo throughput of the Three Gorges Lock and Gezhouba Lock increased from 34.3 million tons in 2004 to 138 million tons and 140 million tons in 2017, respectively.
In the past two years, the Three Gorges ship lift has passed 5,767 ships, 162,200 passengers and 1,712,800 tons of cargo.
Chen Dongyuan, deputy director of the Three Gorges Navigation Administration, said that the Dispatch Regulations play a positive role in promoting the honest management of the sluice crossing, maintaining the navigation order of the two dam hubs, easing the pressure of ships waiting for the sluice in the dam area and enhancing the navigation ability.

With the signature and approval of Premier Li Keqiang, the State Council has recently issued the "Decision on Further Reduction of the Catalogue of Production License Administration of Industrial Products and Simplification of the Examination and Approval Procedures."
The Decision proposes to further reduce the catalogue for the administration of production licenses for industrial products, cancel the administration of production licenses for 14 categories of industrial products, and delegate the authority for the administration of production licenses for four categories of industrial products to the quality and technical supervision departments of the people's governments at the provincial level.
After this reform, the products under the administration of production licenses for industrial products will be reduced from 38 types of pressure last year to 24 categories at present.
The Decision makes it clear that a simplified examination and approval procedure will be implemented for the products in the catalogue.
The first is to change the pre-issue product inspection organized by the license-issuing organ to the product inspection qualification report issued by the qualified inspection and testing institution submitted by the enterprise at the time of application.
Second, in addition to hazardous chemicals, the products licensed by the quality and technical supervision department (market supervision and administration department) of the people's government at the provincial level are subject to post-placement on-site examination. After submitting the application and product inspection qualification report and making a commitment to ensure product quality and safety, the enterprise can obtain a production license after passing the formal examination, and then accept on-site examination within a specified time.
Third, if an enterprise produces and operates different types of products in the catalogue, it shall, in accordance with the principle of "one enterprise, one certificate," examine and issue a license certificate when applying for a new license or applying for a new license.
The Decision requires that all regions and relevant departments should firmly promote the catalogue of pressure reduction and simplify the examination and approval procedures.
We will increase the work of enterprise commitment publicity and post-position on-site examination, strengthen the means of credit supervision and restraint, implement the enterprise's main responsibility for quality, and revoke the production license for those who make false promises and do not meet the requirements.
For products that have been removed from the administration of production licenses for industrial products, it is necessary to earnestly strengthen the supervision after the event. Products involving public health and safety, environmental protection and other products can be turned into compulsory certification, make a positive list and make it known to the public, unify the certification standards, reasonably reduce and certify the testing items. In principle, the cost of compulsory certification shall be borne by the finance at all levels according to the system.
We will take support measures to encourage enterprises to carry out voluntary certification, promote the establishment of brands and expand the market.
It is necessary to benchmark international advanced standards and promote the improvement of the quality of industrial products.
We will give full play to the role of third-party social organizations to ensure the quality and safety of industrial products.
For products that retain the management of production licenses for industrial products, the standard system should be improved, the advantages of industry supervision should be brought into play, the responsibility of "who approves and who supervises" should be strengthened, the risks of product quality and safety should be assessed dynamically, and the catalogues should be reduced, the examination and approval authority delegated or turned into certification management in due course.
In September, China's comprehensive PMI increased the manufacturing PMI from the previous month to the previous month.
The data released by the National Bureau of Statistics of China on the 30th day showed that in September, China's comprehensive PMI output index was 54.1%, which was higher than the previous month and the annual average of 0.3 and 0.1 percentage points, indicating that the production and business activities of Chinese enterprises remained stable on the whole.
In the same month, the manufacturing production index and the non-manufacturing business activity index, which make up the comprehensive PMI output index, were 53.0% and 54.9%, respectively, down one litre from the previous month.
Among them, China's manufacturing PMI was 50.8%, down 0.5 percentage points from the previous quarter.
Zhao Qinghe said that there are five main characteristics of the manufacturing PMI this month:
First, the fundamentals of the manufacturing industry are generally stable.
Among the 21 industries surveyed, the PMI of 14 industries is located in the expansion range, among which the manufacturing PMI of medicine, special equipment and electrical and mechanical equipment are all located at a higher operating level of more than 53.5%, with a faster growth rate.
The second is the small fluctuation of supply and demand.
The production index and the new order index were 53.0% and 52.0%, respectively, down 0.3 and 0.2 percentage points from the previous month. Supply and demand continued to maintain a good state, but the expansion slowed slightly.
The new export order index and the import index were 48.0% and 48.5%, respectively, lower than the 1.4 and 0.6 percentage points of the previous month.
Fourth, the cost of purchasing raw materials for enterprises has increased.
The purchase price index of major raw materials was 59.8%, an increase of 1.1 percentage points over the previous month, and the ex-factory price index was 54.3%, the same as the previous month, all of which were the highs of the year.
Fifth, the operation of large enterprises is sound, and the operation of small enterprises continues to improve.
The PMI of large enterprises is 52.1%, the same as that of the previous month. Since the beginning of this year, the index has always been in the expansion range of 52.0% and above, and the production index and the new order index have both improved this month, which is the main driving force for the manufacturing industry to maintain expansion. The PMI of medium-sized enterprises is 48.7%, lower than the 1.7 percentage points of the previous month and located in the contraction range. The PMI of small enterprises is 50.4%, higher than the 0.4 percentage points of the previous month, rising for two consecutive months.
In the same month, China's non-manufacturing business activity index was 54.9%, up 0.7 percentage points from the previous month, and picked up for the second consecutive month.
According to Zhao Qinghe, the non-manufacturing industry as a whole continues to maintain a steady and positive momentum of development.
The index of business activities in road transport, securities, real estate and other industries continues to be below the critical point, and the total volume of business has decreased.
Nagoya, Nov 5 (Reuters) - The President of the Bank of Japan, Haruhiko Kuroda, said Monday that the central bank is aware that the long-term implementation of ultra-loose monetary policy may squeeze the profit margins of financial institutions and may undermine the stability of the country's banking system.
However, he said that in view of low inflation and uncertainty in overseas economies, the Bank of Japan needs to maintain its large-scale stimulus plan while paying close attention to the advantages and disadvantages of its policies.
"The Bank of Japan fully acknowledges that under the continued monetary easing, the strength of financial institutions will be increasingly affected," Kuroda said in a speech to business leaders in Nagoya.
He said that if financial institutions are more active in taking risks to compensate for the narrowing of profit margins caused by low interest rates over the years, the banking system is likely to be volatile in the event of a serious negative shock.
"Although these risks are not large at present, the central bank will closely monitor the development of the situation and encourage financial institutions to take necessary measures," he said.
The minutes of the meeting of the Bank of Japan released earlier on Monday showed that at the September interest rate meeting, the Policy Committee of the Bank of Japan discussed the rising cost of long-term easing policy.
According to the minutes of the meeting, one member said that if the economy continues to expand, "the Bank of Japan will have more room for flexibility in policy in the future."
According to the minutes of the meeting, another member said that in view of the limitations of the duration of the policy, the Committee should discuss how long the Bank of Japan can maintain the stimulus policy.
Kuroda said that the Bank of Japan will assess the financial risks caused by the easing policy. At the same time, it needs to consider the uncertainty surrounding Japan's economic outlook, which may affect global demand due to Sino-US trade friction and rising protectionism.
"The impact of such problems on the Japanese economy is limited for the time being," Kuroda said.
"But how the problem persists, the impact on the Japanese economy may become larger," he added.
"It is necessary to continue a strong monetary easing policy while considering the positive and negative effects in a balanced way," Kuroda said.
Although the disadvantages of the aggressive stimulus plan have increased, such as long-term low interest rates eroding the profits of financial institutions, low inflation has forced the Bank of Japan to maintain the plan.
The Bank of Japan maintained its monetary policy last month; in the face of the risks posed by the end of the global trade war, Kuroda ruled out the possibility of raising interest rates in the near future.
On June 1, 2018, Cardiff, United States, the corporate logo on the Tesla electric vehicle.
According to a settlement agreement, Tesla Motors of the United States and its Chief Executive Musk have agreed to pay a fine of US $20 million each to the financial regulatory agency. Musk will also resign as chairman of the company but still serve as CEO.
The settlement agreement will put an end to two months of turmoil for Tesla.
The settlement agreement on securities fraud charges disclosed by the Securities and Exchange Commission on Saturday will give investors a sigh of relief.
Investors had feared that the protracted legal battle would only further hit the electric car company, which is still losing money.
On Thursday, the SEC sued Musk for fraud, saying that his tweet on August 7 misled investors.
According to the tweet, he is considering privatizing Tesla at $420 per share and has obtained financing.
According to the SEC, these tweets have no basis in fact, and the market turbulence caused by them has hurt investors.
Investors and corporate governance experts said the agreement could strengthen Tesla, which has been hit hard by Musk's recent behavior.
Steven Heim, head of asset management at Boston Common, said that the settlement agreement should lead to more supervision of Musk and did not take "devastating" measures to drive him out of Tesla.
The asset management company holds shares in Panasonic, Tesla's battery manufacturer.
According to the proposed agreement, Tesla must appoint an independent chairman, two independent directors and a board of directors to establish control over Musk's external communication.
"It is in the best interests of our market and our investors, including Tesla shareholders, that this matter be resolved quickly in accordance with the agreed terms," SEC Chairman Clayton said in a statement.
Thursday's charges resulted in the loss of about $7 billion from Tesla's market value, which stood at $45.2 billion on Friday, lower than GM's $47.5 billion.
In the settlement agreement, the SEC withdrew its request to remove Musk from the position of head of the company.
Many investors said that the penalty would be disastrous.
"I think this is the best possible outcome for all concerned," said Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial Partners, who gave Tesla a "neutral" rating and called the SEC penalty a "light punishment" for Musk.
"It is important for Tesla that he remains CEO."
Neither Musk nor Tesla admitted or denied the SEC's allegations in the settlement agreement and did not immediately return a request for comment.
The settlement agreement still needs to be approved by the court.
Beijing Morning News (reporter Wang Ping) The Beijing Morning News reporter has learned from the Beijing Construction Industry Group that the Beijing Expo Performing Arts Plaza project, one of the core buildings of the Beijing Expo Park in 2019, will adopt a multi-color ETFE jigsaw membrane structure for the first time. The 5,440 square metre membrane structure will present six colors: Dark red, dark green, orange, blue, red and green, and take on the shape of "butterfly wings" under the tension of the cable steel strand.
According to Liu Changbao, project director of the Beijing Construction Industry Wujian Group, the construction area of the Performing Arts Plaza project is 4,500 square meters and the total amount of steel used for installation is 1,182 tons. The steel structure roof is supported by 26 cantilevered steel trusses with umbrella arrangement, which presents the shape of "butterfly wings" under the tension of the cable steel strand.
"Overlooking the Performing Arts Square from the air, the colorful roofs are like butterflies passing through flowers and dancing erratically, and the bright colors will not fade with the passage of time and the wind, frost, rain and snow."
Previously, the monochrome ETFE membrane structure has been widely used in projects such as Bird's Nest and Water Cube, but the multi-color mosaic ETFE membrane structure is the first in the country.
The reporter learned that because there are very few suppliers with multi-color membrane structure production capacity in the world, every inch of membrane structure material is very "precious."
Liu Changbao said that in order to avoid problems such as overlapping and "fighting" in the position of the cable head, the "double-fork ear" cable head structure will also be innovated to ensure that the "fighting" cable head bundle is in the correct position through a special fixed plug-in.
At present, the construction of the Beijing Expo Park in 2019 is under way.
Among them, the international pavilion project has completed the hoisting construction of all "flower umbrellas."
According to the plan, the project will be ready for exhibition by the end of October.

Chinese President Xi Jinping said Monday that China's opening door will not be closed, but will only open more and more, and the pace of promoting a higher level of opening will not stop.
The expansion of imports is not a stop-gap measure, but a long-term consideration for the future. It is expected that China's imports of goods and services will exceed US $30 trillion and US $10 trillion respectively in the next 15 years.
In his keynote speech at the first China International Import Expo, Xi Jinping said that China will further reduce tariffs, accelerate the development of new industries such as cross-border electric commerce, continuously relax market access, promote the opening of the service sector, and relax the restrictions on the ratio of foreign capital stocks in areas such as education and medical care, where there is a large gap in the domestic market.

"China's economy is a sea, not a small pond.
There are times when the wind is calm and there are times of wild wind and rain, "Xi said." Wild wind and rain can overturn small ponds, but not the sea.
After countless times of wild wind and rain, the sea is still there!
After more than 5,000 years of hardship, China is still there!
Looking to the future, China will always be here!
He pointed out that economic globalization has encountered ups and downs, multilateralism and the free trade system have been hit, there are still many unstable and uncertain factors, and risks and challenges have intensified. Open cooperation is an important driving force for enhancing international economic and trade cooperation, and countries should adhere to openness and integration, expand the space for mutually beneficial development and strengthen macroeconomic coordination.
He stressed again that China's opening door will not be closed, but will only open more and more, and the pace of promoting a higher level of opening will not stop.
China will stimulate the import potential, follow the trend of domestic consumption upgrading, take more active and effective measures to promote the increase of residents' income and cultivate middle and high-end consumption growth points.
China will respect international business practices and give equal treatment to all types of enterprises registered in China.
China will protect the legitimate rights and interests of foreign-capital enterprises, resolutely punish the infringement of the legitimate rights and interests of foreign investors, especially the infringement of intellectual property rights, improve the quality and efficiency of intellectual property examination, introduce a punitive compensation system and significantly raise the illegal costs.
Referring to China's economic prospects, Xi said that according to the main indicators of economic growth, employment, prices, balance of payments, corporate profits, fiscal revenue and labour productivity, China's economic operation is in a reasonable range, which has laid an important foundation for the realization of the target task for the whole year.
Compared with other major economies, China's economic growth is still among the highest in the world.
"The fundamentals of the healthy and stable development of China's economy have not changed, the conditions of production factors supporting high-quality development have not changed, and the overall momentum of long-term stability for the better has not changed."
XI said that everyone can be optimistic about the prospect of China's economic development.
According to Xi, China's macro-control capacity has been continuously strengthened and has many favorable conditions for maintaining the long-term, healthy and stable development of the economy. At present, China's economic development has also encountered outstanding contradictions and problems, and measures are being taken to actively solve them, and the results have been and are being shown.
"We believe that as long as we maintain strategic determination, deepen reform and opening-up in an all-round way and make great efforts to resolve outstanding contradictions and problems, China's economy will surely be able to accelerate its transition to a high-quality development track," Xi said.

The death toll from the strong earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 420, and there were no reports of casualties among Chinese citizens
The death toll from the strong earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia's Central Sulawesi province has risen to 420, according to the figures released by Wilem Rampangilei, head of the country's disaster relief agency, quoted by the official Antara news agency at midnight local time.
According to the official, this is only the statistics of the city of Palu, the capital of Central Sulawesi Province. It does not include the Dungara County and the nearby Sigi area, where the epicenter of the earthquake is located, because the communication between the two areas is still interrupted and the number of people killed has not been reported.
Because many roads in the city of Palu have been severely damaged, it is difficult for heavy machinery to enter, and the search and rescue work has encountered great difficulties.
In order to guarantee the rescue, all commercial flights were suspended after the reopening of Palu Airport, which began to be closed on the evening of 28 August, and the flight from Jakarta to Palu, which had been completed by journalists that evening, was cancelled.
After the earthquake and tsunami, the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia learned and verified the situation of Chinese citizens in the disaster area through various channels.
So far, there have been no reports of casualties among Chinese citizens.

General Secretary Xi Jinping delivered a very important speech at the symposium on private enterprises to inject firm confidence in the direction of the private economy to a broader stage.
General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed that "let entrepreneurs unload their ideological baggage and move forward lightly" has aroused strong resonance among the vast number of entrepreneurs and innovative entrepreneurs.
The market vitality comes from people, especially from entrepreneurs, and from the entrepreneurial spirit.
In the course of 40 years of reform and opening-up, there are thousands of stories of entrepreneurs' entrepreneurship and innovation. The growth and growth of the group of entrepreneurs has continuously promoted the breaking of the waves of China's economy.
For some time, some people in the society have made some statements denying and doubting the private economy.
The so-called "private economy departure theory" "new public-private partnership theory" and other erroneous statements have aroused the doubts and concerns of some entrepreneurs.
Recently, some private enterprises have encountered many difficulties and problems in their operation and development.
For example, the changes in the international economic environment have had an impact on some export enterprises; the rapid adjustment of the demand structure has brought about the pressure of transformation and upgrading; some policies are not coordinated with each other, and the policy effects are superimposed on each other, or the working methods are simple, resulting in some policies with good intentions having the opposite effect, and so on.
Various factors are intertwined, the private economy is experiencing difficulties, some private enterprises are facing difficulties in their operation, and entrepreneurs show a lot of anxiety.
Against this background, it is of particularly profound practical significance to correct the misunderstanding of understanding, unload the ideological burden of entrepreneurs, let enterprises focus on development and the government focus on promoting development, which is related to market confidence and development expectations.
This symposium again stressed the important assertion that "the three have not changed": "The status and role of the non-public sector of the economy in China's economic and social development has not changed!"
From the in-depth promotion of decentralization and the establishment of the power list system to the creation of a legal environment that protects the legitimate rights and interests of entrepreneurs, the creation of a market environment of fair competition and the shaping of an atmosphere in which the whole society respects entrepreneurs, in recent years, the Party Central Committee has paid unprecedented attention to entrepreneurs and the strength of institutional guarantee.
The symposium also made clear the policy measures to strongly support the development and growth of private enterprises in six areas, and launched a series of practical actions dedicated to the "light forward" of private enterprises.
All these give great encouragement to the group of entrepreneurs and give more expectations to all sectors of society.
When the fog is lifted, the policy has been set, and the key lies in its implementation.
It is necessary to continuously create a better development environment for the private economy, help private enterprises solve the difficulties in their development and help them realize the transformation and upgrading of China's economy. It is necessary to make entrepreneurs feel fair in market competition, feel safe in their legitimate business operations, feel respect in social life and stimulate innovative vitality and creative potential.
As China's economy enters the process of moving towards high-quality development, it needs more entrepreneurs to express their aspirations, and also provides more space and stage for entrepreneurs to exert their creativity.
We have reason to believe that with the further deepening of reform and the removal of obstacles, the private economy will usher in better development prospects and opportunities and move to a broader stage.
All 46 kinds of supervision certificates in Inner Mongolia's import and export links have been verified on the Internet - China New Network
According to the news of Huhhot Customs on November 5 (reporter Li Aiping), with the exception of special circumstances such as the need for confidentiality, all 46 supervision certificates of local import and export links have been verified on the Internet.
Inner Mongolia enterprises can use paperless method to declare relevant documents to the customs, thus avoiding the problems of on-site running, paper application and repeated submission in the past.
It is understood that the document preparation time refers to the preparation time of all kinds of documents required for the import and export link before the declaration and is a major factor affecting the overall customs clearance time. In order to reduce the customs clearance time and reduce the customs clearance cost, the documents must be reduced.
Previously, there were 86 kinds of regulatory documents that needed to be checked and verified by the customs in the import and export links, involving 19 departments.
It is reported that this time, in accordance with the principle of "cancellation that can be cancelled, merger that can be merged and exit port verification that can be withdrawn from port inspection," and relying on the international trade "single window" platform, the customs and 16 other license-issuing organs have systematically docked and interconnected data, thus realizing more data running and fewer enterprises running errands.
The customs said that in the past, enterprises had to go back and forth to the on-site office hall of the relevant departments to submit paper applications, which had a long process and could not track the audit status in real time.
Now enterprise users can directly log on to the "Single Window" portal and apply online.
After the examination and approval, the license-issuing department transmitted the certificate electronic data to the customs, and realized automatic comparison and intelligent verification with the customs declaration data at the customs clearance link. The examination results were uniformly fed back to the enterprises through the "single window," thus realizing the full process of monitoring the declaration, examination, customs clearance and feedback of documents online.
The export of Hanshen chicken soup to China has soared 20-fold in 4 years or is related to the increase of empty nest youth - CNN.com
Analysis of the 20-fold increase in the export of Hanshen chicken soup to China in four years: Related to the increase of empty nest youth
The Yonhap news agency reported on Friday that the export value of Korean ginseng chicken soup to China exceeded US $100,000 last year, a jump of about 20 times compared with 2013 four years ago.
The analysis shows that this increase is related to the increase of empty nest youth in China, which leads to the hot sale of convenient food, as well as the increase of young people's attention to nutritious food.
The data was released by the Korea Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Circulation Commune (aT) on Friday.
Last year, the export value of Korean ginseng chicken soup to China reached US $1,003.39 million and its weight reached 218.59 million kg, a sharp increase of 2094% and 3668.8% respectively over 2013.
The analysis shows that the increase in sales of Korean ginseng chicken soup in China is related to the increase of empty nest youth leading to the hot sale of convenient food, as well as the increase of young people's attention to nutritious food.
As of this year, China's one-person household has passed the 200 million mark and is expected to increase to 30% of the total population in 2020. Local food enterprises have also launched various convenience foods aimed at the "one-person family."
In addition, the analysis also indicated that avian influenza is the biggest factor preventing ginseng chicken soup from taking root in the Chinese mainland market.
According to aT, there was an outbreak of avian influenza in South Korea from November 2016 to April last year, and the relevant authorities imposed a total ban on the export of ginseng chicken soup to China, resulting in a sharp decrease in the export value.
In 2016, the export value of ginseng chicken soup to China reached US $840,000. Due to avian influenza, the export value plummeted to US $100,000 last year.

Typhoon "Tam Mei" began to turn at noon on the 29th day and moved along the northeast direction, gradually moving away from Fujian Province. At 8: 00 on the 30th day, the center of the typhoon was located on the ocean surface about 140 km from the south-east direction of Kagoshima, Japan.
As a result, the Fujian Provincial Meteorological Observatory lifted the "Marine Wind Warning Class III" at 8: 00 on March 30.
Previously, in order to guard against Typhoon "Tam Mei," as of 11: 00 on 28 August, Fujian had evacuated 268 fishing boats and transferred 2,282 old and weak women and children from the fishing platoon.
The Sino-Vietnamese border estuary port held a national flag-raising ceremony to celebrate the National Day
"I can't think of such a majestic and spectacular flag-raising ceremony in the border area, which is more shocking than watching the flag-raising in the mainland."
On the morning of January 1, Mr. Zhang, who came from Sichuan to visit the Yunnan estuary port on the China-Vietnam border, together with more than 500 troops, resident people and Chinese and foreign tourists, watched the flag-raising ceremony at the national gate to celebrate the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
The estuary port is the largest port in the Yunnan section of the Sino-Vietnamese border. It is located in Hekou County, Honghe Prefecture, Yunnan Province. It is located across the river from the old Vietnamese market and belongs to a national type of port.
With the continuous deepening of the national "Belt and Road" construction, as one of the most convenient channels for China to connect Southeast Asia, the entry and exit flow of estuary ports has increased steadily.
At 7: 30 a.m. that day, the sun just showed a corner, and the restricted area of the estuary port gathered local people and Chinese and foreign tourists who came to watch the flag-raising ceremony early.
At 7: 45, the flag-raising ceremony began on time, and the members of the honor guard of the state gate at the estuary border checkpoint were in high spirits and escorted the national flag to the flag-raising platform with vigorous steps.
After the commander gave the command to raise the flag, the flag-raiser strove to draw an arc with his arm. The bright five-star red flag stretched out its face like an "eagle spreading its wings," and rose slowly with the stirring and majestic melody of the national anthem.
"Holding the National Day flag-raising ceremony at every time node of great significance, such as New Year's Day, Spring Festival and National Day, not only shows the image of China, but also inspires the patriotic feelings of the people of all ethnic groups in the border areas."
So said the officers and soldiers of the honor guard who took part in the flag-raising ceremony.
It is reported that the Guomen honor guard in charge of the flag-raising ceremony at the estuary port is composed of more than 40 officers and soldiers from various posts at the estuary border checkpoint, ranging from a three-person flag-raising team to a large-scale honor guard. The team has experienced a history of more than 60 years and has carried out more than 70 ceremonial tasks of state-level foreign affairs activities since its establishment.
The newly revised Individual Income Tax Law has adjusted the judgment standard for Chinese individual income tax resident taxpayers from one year to 183 days.
The relevant officials of the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation said on Wednesday that in order to maintain policy stability, the next step in the implementation of the new personal income tax law will consider continuing to make preferential arrangements for people from abroad, including those from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
The person-in-charge said that the current regulations for the implementation of the Individual Income Tax Law have special preferential provisions on the issue of tax payment by people from abroad. Individuals who have no residence in China but have resided for more than one year but less than five years may pay individual income tax only on the part paid by units or individuals within China for their income derived from sources outside China.
The part paid abroad does not need to pay individual income tax within the territory of China.
The Ministry of Finance, the State Administration of Taxation, the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Commerce also issued a notice to expand the scope of application of the policy of withholding income tax on foreign investors' direct investment by distributing profits.
For the profits distributed by foreign investors from resident enterprises in China, the scope of application of the policy of withholding income tax for domestic direct investment shall be extended from foreign investment incentive projects to all non-prohibited foreign investment projects and fields.
During the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, all parties released some positive information on the Korean Peninsula issue.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in relayed the DPRK's "irreversible" determination to abandon nuclear weapons and said that US President Donald Trump and North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un may meet before the end of this year.
The State Department later said that Secretary of State Pompeo will visit the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in October to promote the implementation of the commitments of the Singapore meeting between the leaders of the United States and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
Since the beginning of this year, the two Koreas have broken the ice to open the road of dialogue, and the leaders of the two Koreas and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the United States have met. The general trend of de-escalation of the situation on the peninsula has continued, and the principle of dialogue to resolve the Korean Peninsula issue has been upheld.
First of all, the fact that "the essence of the peninsula issue is a security issue" has not changed. The key to achieving peace on the peninsula is to properly and balance the legitimate security concerns of all parties, rather than simply putting pressure on the other side and emphasizing their own demands.
Secondly, in the dialogue to realize the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, the parties concerned still disagree on the steps and ways to realize the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Due to the long-term lack of political trust between the DPRK and the United States, the game thinking of "who comes first and who comes later" remains strong.
At the recent open meeting of the Security Council on the Korean Peninsula held at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, the different voices of all parties around the issue of sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea once again highlighted that these two points "have not changed" on the Korean Peninsula issue.
U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo insisted that the sanctions against the DPRK will not be lifted until the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is fully realized.
On the other hand, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov stressed the principle of "responding to actions with actions," noting that "the weakening trend of sanctions should be the same as the steps taken by the DPRK on the road of gradual nuclear abandonment."
There is no doubt that the parties concerned should continue to implement the Security Council resolutions related to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in a comprehensive, complete and accurate manner, but pressure is not the end. The implementation of sanctions and the promotion of a political settlement are both requirements of the Security Council resolutions.
As stated by Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, in view of the current positive developments in inter-Korean and DPRK-US relations, China believes that it is necessary for the Security Council to consider the timely activation of reversible provisions, so as to encourage the DPRK and other parties concerned to take greater steps towards denuclearization.
In retrospect, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and every progress in the peace process require all parties to show sufficient political courage.
At present, in the face of the increasing expectations of the international community to promote a political solution to the Korean Peninsula issue, the parties concerned should, in particular, show political courage and make political decisions, implement commitments and resolve difficult problems, continue to take steps towards each other, advance the denuclearization process and establish a peace mechanism on the peninsula in parallel, and jointly create a permanent peace on the peninsula.
The People's Government of Ji County, Linfen City, Shanxi Province, reported on Monday that during the National Day, the Huanghehukou Waterfall scenic area located in the county will maintain a relatively high water level and does not meet the conditions for opening up.
In order to ensure safety, the scenic area was temporarily closed during the National Day.
Huanghe Hukou Waterfall is the second largest waterfall in China and the largest yellow waterfall in the world.
With the Yellow River running to this point, the stone walls on both sides of the river stand precipitously and the mouth of the river is narrow as a spout, forming the spirit of "one pot of the Yellow River for thousands of miles."
According to the reporter, June-October is the flood season of the Yellow River every year. From July 12, 2018, due to the high water level of the Yellow River, the Hukou scenic area of the Yellow River in Shanxi began to be closed, so the Hukou scenic area has been closed for nearly a month.
Ni Yufeng, chief engineer of the Hukou Scenic Area Management Committee, told the media that this is the longest extension of the high water level of the Yellow River in the past 20 years. "It has not been relevant for so long before, and the closing time of our flood season in 2017 is four days, and this year is nearly one month."
It is understood that in order to welcome the "11th" Golden Week, the Huanghe Hukou Waterfall Scenic Area in Shanxi Province has also increased personnel arrangements and vehicle maintenance in advance, and even the employment of temporary staff has been put in place.
According to the "Notice on Doing a Good Job in Flood Control of the Yellow River during the National Day" issued by the "Office of the Yellow River Flood Control and Drought Control General Command," Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan and Shandong provinces are required to do a good job in flood control of the Yellow River during the National Day.
At present, the main river flow of the Yellow River is large. The upstream river flow is maintained at 2,000-3,000 cubic meters per second, the middle river flow is maintained at 2,500-3,500 cubic meters per second, and the downstream river flow is maintained at 3,000 cubic meters per second.
Health centres and health stations provide influenza vaccination services especially during the National Day holiday
The Health Bureau ordered 150,000 doses of four-price influenza vaccine for 2018-2019 this year. At this stage, priority is given to high-risk people for free vaccination. To facilitate residents to receive influenza vaccine during holidays, health centres and health stations under the Health Bureau provide vaccination services from 9 a.m. to 1 noon during the National Day holiday (October 1 and 2).
In addition to the above-mentioned convenience measures, the health centres and health stations under the Health Bureau have extended the influenza vaccination service from Monday to Friday to 8 p.m. since the launch of the programme. As at 4 p.m. on September 30, 4,158 people had been vaccinated, compared with 3,714 in the same period last year.
The free vaccination targets include the following Macao residents: Persons from 6 months to under 18 years of age, persons aged 50 and above, pregnant women, all patients with chronic diseases, including obese persons (i.e. those with a body mass index of 30 or above), as well as staff of institutions, nurseries, kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, all health workers and Macao residents working in gambling and entertainment venues.
At the same time, if the Health Bureau considers it necessary to vaccinate other personnel, including the public sector, the Health Bureau will take the initiative to contact the relevant organizations to obtain the list and arrange the vaccination by the health centre.
To facilitate inoculators and reduce the waiting time for inoculation, the Health Bureau will send medical staff to secondary schools, primary schools, kindergartens and nurseries in Macao from October to December this year to conduct group influenza vaccination for young children, small and medium-sized students, teachers and staff. In addition, the Health Bureau will arrange staff to conduct group inoculation in elderly and disabled homes, public sector or other institutions with a large number of people, etc.
Students and young children who are unable to participate in the group inoculation can be inoculated at the inoculation station or health centre of Earl Yan General Hospital with Macao Resident Identity Card, Health Bureau User Card, Influenza Vaccination Card (if any), student card, staff card or vocational certificate from December 3, 2018.
The Health Bureau reminded residents that during the period from September 2017 to August 2018, people who have been vaccinated against influenza from 2017 to 2018 will still need to receive a new season of influenza vaccine from September 2018. As the influenza antigen content of the influenza vaccine in the northern hemisphere for 2018-2019 has been updated, it is aimed at the seasonal influenza in the northern hemisphere for the winter of 2018-2019 and the summer of 2019.
The peak period of influenza in Macao usually occurs in January to March of each year, later than in temperate regions (such as northern China and Japan). The Health Bureau calls on the elderly, children, pregnant women, obese people and chronically ill people, who are at high risk of complications after contracting influenza, and those who often come into contact with high-risk people, to be vaccinated as early as possible.

On the evening of September 29, the reporter learned from the Propaganda Department of the Qingbaijiang District Committee of Chengdu City that on the evening of September 29, Beijing time, a group of Central European banliers (Chengdu) loaded with car connectors, binoculars, liquid crystal display screens and other goods were replaced and transferred through the Schemianufka port in Poland, and finally arrived in Nuremberg, Germany.
This is the first time that the Chinese and European banliers have opened the Polish Schemianufka port line, marking the successful opening of another European transport line after Mara and Jop.
The China-EU train started from the Qingbaijiang City Box Station in Chengdu on September 14. It left through the Alashan Pass and entered Europe through the Schemianufka port in Poland. It finally reached Nuremberg, Germany, for a total of about 16 days.
For the first time, China and Europe have carried out the replacement operation of the wide rail and the standard rail.
The opening of this port has effectively solved the long-term operation and long-term problems caused by the current congestion at the Mara Port, and raised the time limit of the liner transport. It has also provided a new solution to the congestion problem at the Mara Port, further enhanced the carrying capacity and transport efficiency of the hinterland of western China to the European Mediterranean market, and laid a solid foundation for the development of the European market by the China-EU Banlei.
More than 400 people have been confirmed dead after a 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday, many of whom were swept away by the tsunami waves caused by the earthquake.
The authorities expect that the total number of deaths on Sunday will increase significantly as new data are reported in remote areas.
It is reported that dozens of people are still trapped under the rubble of a hotel and a shopping center in the city of Baru.
Large waves of up to six meters (20 feet) caused by the earthquake hit the city of Baru.
So far, only the death toll from Baru, the death toll in Dungra, north of Baru, has been reported very slowly, and the authorities are preparing for a worse situation.
Dongra has a resident population of 300,000, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Indonesian Vice President Kara said the total death toll could rise to thousands.
When the huge waves hit the coast at dusk on Friday, hundreds of people gathered on the beach to celebrate the festival. Many people were swept away by the huge waves and everything was destroyed wherever they went.
Tokyo (Reuters) - The quarterly report of the short-term survey released by the Bank of Japan on Monday showed that the confidence of large Japanese manufacturers hit its lowest level in more than a year in the September quarter, as the rising cost of raw materials and a series of natural disasters affected production, making enterprises feel the pressure.
This survey hardly shows that the escalating global trade friction has hit the confidence of large manufacturers.
However, the risk of a full-scale trade war has hit the business prospects of enterprises and may threaten their capital expenditure.
Active capital expenditure is a bright spot in the Japanese economy.
The survey calls into question the view of the Bank of Japan that sound economic expansion will help accelerate the inflation rate to reach the 2% target, although there are signs that companies are gradually passing on costs to customers.
"Under the situation of concern caused by the global trade war, the confidence of manufacturers tends to stagnate due to the slowdown of exports and weak factory production," said Nan Wuzhi, chief researcher of the Jinzhong Institute of Agriculture and Forestry.
"Confidence is still high. And as corporate profits are improving and prices are rising, I do not believe that confidence will continue to decline."
The short-term survey shows that the large-scale manufacturing industry sentiment judgment index fell to positive 19 in September from positive 21 three months ago, which is the third consecutive quarter of deterioration.
The median estimate of the market is positive 22.
In September, the large-scale non-manufacturing sentiment judgment index fell to positive 22 from positive 24 in the June survey, the first deterioration in eight quarters.
The Reuters survey was positive 22.
The survey showed that the average of the large-scale manufacturing and non-manufacturing industry sentiment judgment index remained stable in December.
Investors did not care about the decline of the short-term business sentiment judgment index, and the Nikkei .N225 rose to a 27-year high on Monday, as the continued depreciation of the yen helped improve the export profit prospects of Japanese enterprises.
Capital expenditure is sound.
Despite the decline in business confidence, the latest short-term outlook highlights the soundness of the enterprise capital expenditure plan, which benefits from the renewal of production capacity and increased investment in robotics and automation to cope with the labor shortage caused by the aging population.
The central bank's short-term survey shows that large enterprises plan to increase their capital expenditure by 13.4% in the current fiscal year ending March 2019.
In the previous short-term survey, it was 13.6%.
Nan Wuzhi said that the capital expenditure plan of all enterprises increased by 8.5% in the current fiscal year, which is close to the pace of Japan's bubble economy era.
"Given that small enterprises have raised their profit estimates from now on, there is still room for further growth in capital expenditure, but this largely depends on the impact of the trade war on business confidence," he said.
The short-term survey shows that the ability of enterprises to pass on costs has increased, and the output price index of large enterprises is positive 7, which is a 10-year high. This is an encouraging sign and reflects the progress made in Japan's efforts to combat deflation.
The index measuring the employment situation of large enterprises hit minus 23, the tightest level since 1992, highlighting the tightening of the employment market.
Benefiting from strong corporate spending, Japan's economy rebounded in the second quarter from the contraction in January-March this year.
However, the escalation of trade friction in the summer and the disruption of the supply chain by natural disasters have clouded the prospects of Japan's export-dependent economy.
In dollar terms, the growth rate of service imports and exports is 16.4%.
The press release on the website of the Ministry of Commerce quoted the head of the Department of Trade and Industry as saying that the total import and export of emerging services exceeded 1 trillion yuan from January to August, and the growth rate was faster than the total.
Among them, the total import and export of emerging services reached 1,138.39 billion yuan, an increase of 20.9%, which was 10.4 percentage points higher than the overall growth rate of service imports and exports, and led to an increase of nearly 3 percentage points in the proportion of emerging services.
In terms of service exports, from January to August, service exports continued the rapid growth momentum since the beginning of this year, and the growth rate of exports was 5.7 percentage points higher than that of imports.
Among them, the top three areas of growth were telecommunications computer and information services, personal cultural and entertainment services and insurance services, with growth rates of 61.1%, 38.8% and 26.5% respectively.
The head of the Department of Trade and Industry also pointed out that the proportion of new service imports increased gradually from January to August.
From January to August, the import of emerging services grew rapidly, accounting for 23.6% of service imports, an increase of 1.6 percentage points over the same period last year.
Among them, the import of financial services, intellectual property royalties, telecommunications computers and information services all grew by more than 20%, accounting for 47.1%, 23.3% and 23.2% respectively.

Overseas tourists bless China: The motherland is strong and I am proud - CNN.com
With economic development and the strengthening of national strength, the word "China" has become more and more important in the international arena.
All this has been felt more deeply by overseas Chinese living abroad.
The reform and opening-up of the motherland is so successful that our overseas Chinese feel very happy, so this is very proud, and I hope that our motherland will become stronger and stronger.
Every time I return home, the changes in the country are very great, and more and more artists have come out to spread Chinese culture. I think this change is very big.
The reform and opening-up of our country is definitely a miracle of the world.
Compared with the past, it is a great honor for our association in Canada to say that it is Chinese.
We are very proud of our motherland's efforts over the years.
The strength of China is shared by overseas tourists, and many foreign friends have also expressed their admiration.
They also sent their own blessings to China and the Chinese people.
I think China is one of the most fascinating cultures and civilizations in the world, and I wish the friendship between China and the United Arab Emirates more long-term prosperity in the future.
Bless all the Chinese people, because you are great.
Living and working in China, you have helped me and hope that all is well with you.

As a matter of fact, China has developed very well in recent years, which also makes me happy.
I wish the Chinese people a happy National Day!
Oil prices or usher in the "three consecutive increases" National Day self-driving travel can be filled with oil in advance.
At 24: 00 on September 30, a new round of price adjustment window for refined oil will be opened simultaneously with the National Day holiday.
A number of institutions predict that the oil price will be raised significantly to achieve "three consecutive increases."
Car owners who plan to travel by self-driving can fill their cars with oil before the price increase.
According to the data measured by Longzhong Information, the corresponding increase of domestic refined oil is expected to be about 190 yuan per ton, and that of Zhuozhong Information is 220 yuan per ton.
In September, the oil price has been raised twice: On September 3, gasoline was raised by 180 yuan per ton and diesel by 170 yuan per ton; on September 17, gasoline was raised by 145 yuan per ton and diesel by 145 yuan per ton.
Domestic oil prices are linked to international oil prices. Since the current pricing cycle, international oil prices have risen in shock and Brent crude oil has continued to explore after breaking the US $80 mark.
At the close of September 28, U.S. WTI crude oil futures closed up $1.13 at $73.25 per barrel.
Brent crude oil futures closed up $1.0 at $82.72 per barrel.
"In view of the international situation, the United States sanctions against Iran and other tensions are superimposed, and the overall trend of oil prices is strong. Subsequently, the OPEC production reduction meeting explicitly refused to increase production and gave market confidence, and oil prices moved steadily upward."
Zang Wengang, an analyst of ZhuoChuang information product oil, said.
On the retail side, the current gasoline prices of No. 92 and No. 95 at the PetroChina and Sinopec gas stations in Beijing are 7.66 yuan per litre and 8.15 yuan per litre, respectively.
According to Li Yan, an information analyst at Longzhong, there has not been much change in the preferential promotion strategy of gas station retail. At present, the preferential margin of Sinopec and other main stations is more than 0.5-0.7 yuan per litre, while the preferential margin of private gas stations is more than 0.5-1.2 yuan per litre.
"The current round of retail prices will be 'three consecutive increases', equivalent to an increase of about 0.14-0.16 yuan, and private car owners are advised to fill up with oil before the arrival of the National Day holiday," Li Yan said.

Subsequently, the Social Affairs Bureau of the Hedong New District of Suining City set up an investigation team to enter the school to investigate and question the relevant personnel, collect evidence on the spot and transfer the teachers involved from their posts.
Yesterday, the official microblog of the Hedong New District Management Committee of Suining City issued a briefing, saying that after investigation, Luo XX, a teacher of Suizhou Foreign Language Primary School, physically punished students.
After research, the year-end assessment of Suizhou Foreign Language Primary School was "rejected by one vote," and the annual "merit evaluation" qualification was cancelled.
According to the circular, the administrative team of the Suizhou Foreign Language Primary School was given a collective exhortation talk, and the division leaders and class guides were dealt with in accordance with the relevant provisions; the teacher involved, Luo XX, was transferred from his post as a teacher and dealt with seriously in accordance with the relevant provisions; and the Suizhou Foreign Language Primary School was ordered to make an in-depth inspection and carry out activities for the construction of teachers' ethics and teachers' style, and take practical measures to prevent the recurrence of such incidents.

Opening of the 69th International Astronautical Congress in Germany - CNN.com
Xinhua News Agency, Bremen, Germany, October 1 (reporter Ren Ke Zhang Yirong) The 69th International Astronautical Congress kicked off on October 1 at the Bremen Convention and Exhibition Center in Germany, attended by more than 6,300 astronauts, representatives of space agencies and enterprises, experts, scholars and young students from all over the world.
In his speech at the opening ceremony, Jean-Yves Le Gaal, President of the International Astronautical Federation, said that the global space industry is no longer attended by only a few countries and institutions, and the number of participants this year has increased significantly over the previous one, indicating that more and more institutions and people are joining it.
He called on all countries to strengthen cooperation and innovation and jointly promote the development of the space industry.
While attending the exchange activities, Zhang Kejian, Vice Minister of Industry and Information Technology of China and Director of the National Space Administration, introduced China's space program and said that China will expand international cooperation in the space field and contribute to the space industry of mankind.
Representatives of the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation and other relevant institutions, as well as some private enterprises, attended the meeting and demonstrated the latest achievements of China's aerospace, including various types of launch vehicles, satellites and space science and technology application products.
The International Astronautical Congress has been held annually since 1950 and is the largest event of the world aviation community.
The five-day congress is jointly sponsored by the International Astronautical Federation, the International Academy of Astronautics, the Center for Applied Science and Technology and Microgravity Research of Bremen University and the International Institute of Space Law.
According to a press release issued by Reuters Beijing November 5 - China Foreign Trade Center on Sunday, the Canton Fair shows that China's foreign trade situation is still complex and severe, and 80.6% of enterprises expect the export situation for the whole year of 2018 to be better than that of the previous year or even.
However, considering the external environment in which the cost of domestic raw materials, labor and other comprehensive factors continues to rise and the impact of trade friction between China and the United States has increased, the exhibitors also believe that the export situation next year is not optimistic.
At the closing press conference of the 124th Canton Fair, Xu Bing, deputy secretary-general of the Canton Fair, press spokesman and deputy director of the China Foreign Trade Center, said that the number of overseas buyers and export transactions of the Canton Fair had decreased slightly year-on-year.
This year, 189,812 buyers came to the meeting, coming from 215 countries and regions, a decrease of 1.11% year-on-year.
Export transactions reached 206.494 billion yuan (equivalent to US $29.86 billion), a decrease of 1% year-on-year.
From the market point of view, the transactions of Japan, the 10 ASEAN countries, the BRIC countries and the Republic of Korea increased by 74.4%, 11.4%, 7.2% and 2.5% respectively, while the traditional markets of the United States, Australia, Canada and the European Union decreased by 30.3%, 8.9%, 7.3% and 0.8% respectively.
In terms of industry, means of transport, machinery and equipment, construction and decoration materials, electronic consumer goods and information products, and sanitary equipment increased by 24.8%, 21.1%, 20.0%, 15.1% and 7.6% respectively, while textile and clothing and household appliances decreased by 13.0% and 6.7% respectively.
Xu Bing said that as a barometer and weather vane of China's foreign trade, the participation of buyers and export transaction data of the current Canton Fair show that China's foreign trade development will still face many uncertain and unstable factors next year.
However, with the in-depth promotion of supply-side structural reform and the recent national and local policies and measures in the areas of "six stability," the new dynamic energy of China's foreign trade development is accelerating and new progress has been made in the diversification of the enterprise market, all of which are important foundations and powerful conditions for the development of foreign trade.
"Taking into account various factors, it is expected that China's foreign trade import and export will maintain steady growth and further improve its quality and benefits throughout the year," Xu Bing said.
The General Administration of Customs of China announced that US dollar-denominated exports increased by 14.5% year-on-year in September, while imports increased by 14.3% year-on-year. The trade surplus in September was US $31.69 billion, and the export growth rate and trade surplus in September were the highest since February this year.
Despite the escalating trade friction between China and the United States, China's export performance in September still greatly exceeded expectations. Strong foreign demand, enterprises scrambling for exports before the imposition of tariffs by the United States and the devaluation of the RMB exchange rate, or the main supporting factors also show the resilience of China's foreign trade to a certain extent. However, the impact of the Sino-US trade war on confidence and the impact on the industrial chain should not be underestimated. Analysts believe that the challenges of China's foreign trade may appear in the fourth quarter or next year.
According to a Reuters survey, U.S. fund managers proposed to increase their cash holdings in September and continue to maintain a cautious stance, as the United States and China began the latest round of mutual import tariffs and the dispute showed no signs of easing.
However, the 12 fund managers who participated in the survey suggested that the asset allocation in North America increased to the highest since June 2017, while the positions of the United Kingdom, the euro area and especially emerging markets declined.
The average share of global stock allocation is 56.6% and that of bonds is 35.5%, which is basically in line with last month's survey.
The most obvious change is that the cash ratio rose to 5.1%, the highest since December 2014.
A fund manager of a large fund company said, "Some economic data have brought confidence to the market, but the trade war is still the biggest concern, so it is better to be ready to enter when the market falls back."
But fund managers still preferred stocks, especially US stocks, in September, even though US stocks were considered to be high in price.
Today, in Shanghai, China's open landmark, the world's first large-scale national-level exhibition with the theme of import, the China International Import Expo, officially kicked off in the expectation of thousands of people.
An exhibition is like a "window" to enable the world to better understand a city and a country.
Through the "window" of the Fair, people see that they are moving towards a higher level of "open China." With the help of the "window" of the Fair, the world is welcome to win-win cooperation with China, which is "starting from reform and opening up again."
"For a country, opening up is like breaking a cocoon into a butterfly. Although it will experience a moment of pain, it will bring new life."
General Secretary Xi Jinping's summary of the road to opening up points out an important reason for "why China can."
Recalling the 40 years of reform and opening-up, China, which has dared to plunge into the vast ocean of the world market, has always faced all risks and challenges with an open attitude, continuously released its endogenous driving force and continuously improved its competitiveness, although it has encountered whirlpools and wind and waves.
It can be said that with its own solid achievements, China has vigorously interpreted the value and significance of opening up.
Standing at a new historical starting point, holding an import-themed exposition is a major decision made by the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core to promote a new round of high-level opening to the outside world. It is a major initiative by China to open its market to the world. It is a practical action by China to support economic globalization and trade liberalization. It demonstrates the strong and clear will that "the door of China's opening will not be closed, but will only open wider and wider."
The active registration of exhibitors from all countries and the "one difficult to find" booth are the biggest affirmation and best response to China's development of an open economy in a larger scope, wider field and deeper level.
More importantly, the current global economic and trade order has come to a crossroads.
Some countries have built a high wall of trade protectionism and returned to the old road of unilateralism, which has increased the international community's concern about the prospect of free trade and added a lot of uncertainty to the recovering world economy.
Against this background of the times, this grand event on the banks of the Huangpu River embodies China's defense of free trade and allows the world to see China's self-confidence and China's commitment to open its market and share the future.
It is quick to go alone, but far to go.
By opening its mind and embracing the world, China has not only vigorously promoted its own development, but also brought a surging "China opportunity" to all countries and regions of the world.
In recent years, China has advocated and promoted the joint construction of the "Belt and Road," initiated the establishment of the AIIB and set up the Silk Road Fund.... China has provided a series of international public goods, provided real export markets, development opportunities and jobs, and allowed enterprises of all countries to take the "express train" for China's development.
The Fair is also such a public product and a large platform for global economic and trade cooperation.
On this platform, more than 3,000 enterprises from more than 130 countries and regions have taken a new step in the Chinese market with their distinctive high-quality products and services.
In addition to national enterprises, the real beneficiaries are domestic consumers.
By setting up this "preferred and advanced" platform, it provides a multi-channel high-quality supply for consumption upgrading and meets the individualized, diversified and differentiated consumption needs of the people.
As China's open door opens wider and wider, goods flow freely and make the best use of everything, the step towards a better life will be more solid.
From a more macro perspective, the significance of entering the Fair has gone beyond the scope of economy and trade. Instead, it focuses on the future, conveys the concept of openness, inclusiveness, universal benefit, balance and win-win, and forms a consensus to jointly address today's challenges.
If the world is good, China can be good; if China is good, the world is better.
We expect that the Fair will bring excellence and perfection to the world, and we look forward to a higher level of "open China" and the world to work together to build a glorious future of the community of human destiny.
Foreign media: The United States and Canada reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The agreement includes that Canada will open its dairy market to the United States and that the United States will not impose tariffs on Canadian-made cars for the time being.
According to foreign media reports, a Canadian source revealed on the evening of September 30 local time that the United States and Canada have reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
It was revealed that the agreement includes that Canada will open its dairy market to the United States and that the United States will not impose tariffs on Canadian-made cars for the time being.
On August 27, the United States and Mexico announced that they had reached a preliminary agreement in principle on updating the North American Free Trade Agreement, but the United States and Canada failed to reach an agreement before the August 31 deadline set by the United States and extended the negotiation period to September 30.
Earlier, a spokesman for Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland said that Canada would only sign a favorable agreement. "The focus is on the substance, not the timetable. We will continue consultations and hope to reach an agreement that is in Canada's national interest."
More than 90% of Brazilian women voters said that the presidential candidates did not take into account the needs of women.
According to the South American Diaspora Network, the data recently released by the Brazilian National Institute of Geography (IBGE) shows that more than 90% of Brazilian women do not believe that the presidential candidates take into account the needs of women.
According to the report, at present, the number of women in Brazil has reached 107 million. If women from all over Brazil are brought together to form a country, the population of this country will be ranked 13th in the world, more than twice the population of Spain.
In Brazil, the number of women voters accounts for 52 per cent of the total number of voters and 48 per cent of men. Although the proportion of women among voters is very high, the proportion of women in the Brazilian Congress is only 10 per cent.
Among the 193 countries in the world, Brazilian women's participation in politics ranks only 154th, higher than that of the Arab countries.
After more than 20 years of struggle for rights, Brazilian women still have not succeeded in obtaining their due rights.
Natalia Mori, a Brazilian sociologist, pointed out that the reason for the existence of this phenomenon is the result of the combination of ancient patriarchal society, racism and capitalist values.
"Politics should be composed of citizens advocating civil rights, identity, access to public goods and multiple social groups to form the same society. But Brazilian politics belongs to the monopoly of a certain group and the majority of the population is not represented."
A previous study conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Locomotiva also pointed out that 94% of Brazilian women do not feel that elected politicians can represent their rights, 90% of Brazilian women do not agree with the decisions made by politicians and 93% of women do not agree with the current government's governance policies.
"We need to reverse the under-representation of women in Parliament. Brazil's political system is still affected by inequality. So far, there is still serious gender, class and racial discrimination in Brazil's political field," Natalia Mori said.
Despite the lack of women's rights, the majority of Brazilian women still believe in the power of democracy.
The survey shows that 76% of women think they can make a difference in democratic elections and 72% of women are interested in politics.
In addition, 55% of women believe that democratic politics is the best way to make women suffer less prejudice.
Astana, China (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan held a solemn flag-raising ceremony on October 1 to welcome the 69-year-old birthday of New China.
All the staff of the Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan, news agencies in Kazakhstan, financial institutions, Chinese enterprises, overseas Chinese, Confucius Institutes and representatives of foreign students took part in the activities.
On October 1, the Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan held a flag-raising ceremony to welcome the 69th birthday of New China.
After the flag-raising ceremony, the Chinese Ambassador to Kazakhstan, Zhang Xiao, said that on the occasion of the 69th birthday of the great motherland, we solemnly held the flag-raising ceremony in a foreign country, which was a profound patriotic education activity.
Although we have lived overseas for a long time, our hearts are always attached to the great motherland.
Zhang Xiaoxiao said that today, more than ever before, the Chinese nation is closer to the great goal of national rejuvenation and closer to the center of the world stage than ever before.
"Our mission, responsibilities and work are more glorious, arduous and onerous than ever before."
Zhang Xiaoxiao stressed that we should not forget the initial heart, keep in mind the mission, push China and Kazakhstan to build the "Belt and Road" in a stable and far-reaching way and go deeper and more realistic, draw a more beautiful "work-brush painting" for the joint construction of the "Belt and Road" and devote all our strength to the development and construction of the motherland and the friendly cooperation between China and Kazakhstan.
The T2 terminal of Guangxi Guilin Two Rivers International Airport was officially opened on March 30.
Zhao Leqin, secretary of the Guilin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, said that the opening of the new terminal can meet the annual passenger throughput demand of 12 million and build a new advantage of Guilin air traffic, which is of great significance to further improve the modern three-dimensional traffic pattern of Guangxi's river-sea linkage, sea-rail combined transport, water-land advance and air-port connection "four-in-one."
This year, Guilin is expected to receive more than 90 million visitors.
The expansion project of the T2 terminal and supporting facilities of the two rivers international airport in Guilin is a major public welfare project for the 60th anniversary of the founding of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, as well as a landmark project for the construction of the international tourist resort in Guilin.
Construction of the project began in December 2015, with a construction area of 100,000 square meters and a total investment of 3.258 billion yuan. After its completion and commissioning, the project can meet the needs of 12 million annual passenger throughput, 101,200 takeoffs and landings and 95,000 tons of cargo and mail throughput.
On the same day, more than 200 flights took off and landed at the T2 terminal of Guilin Two Rivers International Airport.
The modeling design of the new terminal is inspired by the mountains and waters of Guilin, and the distant view is like a "mountain and water laurel crown," and the near view is like the "dragon ridge terraced field" and the eaves of the residential buildings in northern Guilin, which intersect with the mountains and waters of Guilin.
According to the report, the new terminal of Guilin Airport can meet the peak flow of nearly 4,000 arrivals and departures per hour, applied intelligent baggage sorting system, security integration platform, face recognition and other "smart airport" technical means, and planned a commercial area covering a variety of business modes, including catering, department stores, tax exemption and leisure and entertainment.
Since most of the growth in Europe, Asia and emerging markets is not encouraging, the United States has increasingly become the main engine of global economic growth.
On September 23, 2018, a container freighter docked in the port, New Jersey, United States.
However, because the current growth of the United States benefits from the timing of the fiscal stimulus of tax reduction, the country's economy is also closely watched by the outside world.
"As the United States is returning to full employment, it is inevitable that the economy will decline."
He said that the only question is when it will happen, and in his view, it may only be sooner rather than later.
Although Barclays is optimistic about the economic outlook of the United States before the end of this year, the bank acknowledges that it is more difficult to make forecasts for a longer period of time.
"In the absence of more sustainable investment growth to boost the economic growth potential, the current growth stimulated by fiscal policy will not be sustainable," Barclays economists said in a research report.
"In the absence of investment growth, the risk of a hard landing of the economy in 2020 will rise," they said.
A series of enterprise surveys will roughly show that the major economies are in the economic cycle stage at the end of the third quarter.
The eurozone and US manufacturing surveys scheduled to be released next Monday will receive attention, and the service sector survey will be released on Wednesday.
But the focus of next week's data will inevitably be the US non-farm employment data to be released next Friday, which will provide clues as to whether the tight job market is driving a large increase in wages.
Its importance is not only important for the profitability of enterprises and the purchasing power of consumers, but also because the jump in wages or the rise of overall inflation may upset the officials of the United States Federal Reserve (Fed / FED).
"Pay will be of great concern because it is likely to rise sharply again from the previous month.
The increase in September from a year earlier may not exceed 3%, but we can fully expect a breakthrough next month, "ING economists wrote in a research report.
At a time when the holiday in China and other parts of Asia leads to a weak data surface in the region next week, the political situation in Europe may become a source of market volatility.
The Italian government has ignored its previous financial commitments to the EU, and the other EU member states will have to quickly determine whether to firmly oppose Italy's decision. Eritrea does not support the decision and wants to abide by EU rules.
As the Brexit negotiations enter a critical stage, the annual meeting of the British Conservative Party to be held in Birmingham may also spark.
At the same time, with the highly anticipated presidential election to be held in Brazil next weekend, the concerns surrounding emerging markets are unlikely to abate.
[Abstract] After its completion, the ship will be delivered to the East China Sea Branch of the State Oceanic Administration of China for use. Chen Zhi, Director of the Observation Division of the Marine Early Warning and Monitoring Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China, said that the commissioning of the ship will be of great significance to the development of China's offshore ocean observation system and the promotion of global ocean observation.
On September 29, China's first large-scale 3,000-ton buoy ship, "Xiangyang Hong 22," was launched at the China Wushu Group.
After its completion, the ship will break the current equipment bottleneck in China's support work such as the deployment, recovery and emergency repair of large buoys and submersible markers.
The "Xiangyang Red 22" wheel is mainly used for the regular inspection and maintenance, regular deployment and recovery of buoys / submersibles, as well as the emergency deployment, recovery and emergency repair of buoys / submersibles. At the same time, it has the ability to carry out comprehensive marine investigation tasks such as cross-sectional survey.
The new ship has a total length of 89 meters, a width of 18 meters, a depth of 7.2 meters and a carrying capacity of 10,000 nautical miles.
Wang Weiling, deputy general manager of Wuzhou Group, said: "Xiangyang Hong 22 is the first large-scale buoy operating ship in China and the only domestic working ship with the ability to lift 10-meter large-scale buoys, which will further enhance China's large-scale buoy support capacity."
It is understood that after its completion, the ship will be delivered to the East China Sea Branch of the State Oceanic Administration of China for use. Chen Zhi, Director of the Observation Division of the Marine Early Warning and Monitoring Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China, said that the commissioning of the ship will be of great significance to the development of China's offshore ocean observation system and the promotion of global ocean observation.
"At the same time, the ship has a large-scale buoy placement and maintenance operation, as well as a comprehensive marine investigation capability. It is the first comprehensive ship in China dedicated to the operation of medium- and far-sea buoys and comprehensive marine investigation.
With such a buoy operating vessel, we will have a powerful tool for ocean observation and ocean investigation in the future. "
Qingdao, China, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Affected by the sound of Typhoon "Tam Mei," the "Maze Run Cup" of the Qingdao Station of the 2018 International Extreme Sailing Series, which was scheduled to start on September 30, postponed the first race day to October 1 and held a pre-race meeting at the Qingdao Olympic Sailing Center before the race. The captains of 12 water-wing double-bodied sailing teams from six countries and regions made an appearance.
Affected by the sound of Typhoon "Tam Mei," the strong wind in the harbour pool continued and the maximum wind speed was even as high as 24 knots. The sailing signal was delayed for nearly 90 minutes from 1 p.m. on the 30th day. The wind speed still did not decrease. The chief referee of the event, Anne Mdrant, announced the cancellation of the first day of the competition and postponed the game to the afternoon of October 1.
"The strong wind from the shore continues, and the sea conditions are really too violent."
"Under such circumstances, no one knows when and what kind of wind gusts are blowing towards the racing boat," Mdrant explained.
Close to the city's playing field, in view of the current wind conditions, it is the wisest choice to cancel the competition, "he said.
All the crew members who are ready are still somewhat disappointed.
"The racing boat is ready to stop and we are in good shape."
"But I know that the rescheduling of the competition is the right choice, and I hope that today the wind energy is smaller and we can show our strength," admitted Max Richardson, the helmsman of the Qingdao team.
Omica Wilkinson, the "star of hope" known as the New Zealand team for the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games, said: "The loss of one day makes the game more interesting.
Because the weight of today's game will increase, and there are only two days left to play.
People are going to work extremely hard, "he said.
Despite the strong sea breeze, Pierre Yves Durand, the helmsman of the French ABM team, told his warm past with Qingdao, where the competition was held, at the pre-race meeting: Five years ago, the International Extreme Sailing Series suffered an accidental injury and muscle fracture. Thanks to the treatment of the local sports medical team, he was able to stand at the competition venue today, five years later.
It is reported that the International Extreme Sailing Series was founded in 2007 and is a World Sailing League event with the same name as Volvo, the America's Cup and the World Sailing Challenge Tour.
The "flying ghost" water wing double-body sail (Flying Phantom) will be used in the Qingdao Station competition.
The year 2018 is the eighth year that the event landed in Qingdao, the "sailing capital," and the Qingdao Station is also the closing battle of the series.
Despite the continued turmoil in the global financial market, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said Monday that the investment income of the Exchange Fund in the third quarter of this year decreased by 97% on an annual basis, but was better than the performance of the previous quarter. As a result of the Sino-US trade war, overseas stocks rose and foreign exchange losses narrowed significantly.
According to the latest data of the HKMA, the Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK $1.6 billion in July-September 2018, which is significantly lower than the HK $61.8 billion in the same period last year, but better than the revised HK $100 million in the second quarter of this year.
The President of the HKMA, Mr Chan Tak-lin, said in the Legislative Council that at the beginning of the Sino-US trade war, the stock index of Hong Kong and emerging markets ran counter to the US stock index. After the US stock market index peaked in late September and early October, the market sentiment began to reverse, as investors gradually realized that the trade war was also detrimental to the US itself.
"It is a good thing that there is a change in market sentiment. If the trade war has only one-sided impact, it will not help much to solve the problem."
But he also pointed out that "if the Sino-US trade war is not resolved, financial market volatility will continue to rise."
In the third quarter of this year, the stock investment loss of the Exchange Fund in Hong Kong narrowed by 8% to HK $4.7 billion compared with the previous quarter, while the overseas stock investment income increased by 172% to HK $12.8 billion. The foreign exchange loss of HK $16.2 billion and the bond income of HK $9.7 billion decreased by 24% and 31% respectively on a quarterly basis, mainly reflecting the general rise of the US dollar against major currencies during the quarter and the rise of the US interest rate to 3% in mid-September.
The Exchange Fund is mainly used to support the Hong Kong dollar.
Hong Kong has implemented the linked exchange rate system between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar since 1983.
Regarding the current financial situation in Hong Kong, Chen Delin said that the economic and asset market uncertainty has increased and the downside risks have increased, but Hong Kong's financial system is sound, it has also done a good job of defense and has sufficient earthquake resistance.
"Hong Kong has an abundant international investment position, with an external net asset value of US $1.4 trillion equivalent to four times GDP, which is 2.5 times higher than that of Singapore and 0.6 times that of Japan. It is more than enough to cope with the economic downward cycle or reversal."
Recently, the Hong Kong dollar interest rate has continued to fall and the spread between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar has widened. Chen Delin pointed out that the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar rose by more than 400 basis points on September 21. It is generally believed that the rise of the Hong Kong dollar interest rate is mainly related to the rise of the Hong Kong dollar interest rate. Since then, the Hong Kong dollar has hovered around the level of 7.80-7.84.
However, he believes that with the beginning of the interest rate hike cycle of Hong Kong banks and the normalization of the Hong Kong dollar interest rate, the situation of the Hong Kong dollar interest rate lower than the US dollar interest rate will change in the future.
"The trend of the Hong Kong dollar interest rate and the US dollar interest rate will be more consistent. We must be more careful in managing risks and be prepared to cope with market fluctuations."
Due to the abundance of Hong Kong dollar funds, the Hong Kong dollar interest rate fell further. The three-month interest rate fell by 0.9% to 2.08179% on Monday, and the difference between the three-month interest rate and the US dollar increased from 46 basis points to 51 basis points. The one-month interest rate reached a five-month low, and the difference between the one-month interest rate and the US dollar increased from 120 basis points to 127 basis points.
From May to mid-September, the spot exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar was close to 7.85 to the US dollar for most of the time.
During the period, due to factors such as the outflow of some funds from the Hong Kong dollar after the completion of interest-bearing activities and large-scale stock offering activities, the weak party exchange guarantee was triggered several times in May and August after it was first triggered in April.
In accordance with the linked exchange rate system, the HKMA buys Hong Kong dollars and sells US dollars at the level of 7.85 to maintain the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.
The HKMA bought a total of about HK $52.1 billion under the weak party exchange guarantee mechanism in May and August.
Is there any preferential treatment for people from abroad under the new tax law?
In response to questions on the 30th day, the relevant officials of the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation said that in order to maintain policy stability, the next step in the implementation of the new personal income tax law will consider continuing to make preferential arrangements for people from abroad, including those from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
A reporter asked that the newly revised Individual Income Tax Law adjusted the judgment standard for resident taxpayers of China's individual income tax from one year to 183 days.
Will there be any preferential arrangements for overseas people, including those from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, in the next step of the implementation of the Law?
In response, the person-in-charge said that the current regulations for the implementation of the Individual Income Tax Law have special preferential provisions on tax payment by people from abroad. Individuals who have no residence in China but have resided for more than one year but less than five years may pay individual income tax only on the part paid by units or individuals within China for their income derived from sources outside China.
The person-in-charge said that in order to maintain policy stability, the next step in the implementation of the new personal income tax law will consider continuing to make preferential arrangements for people from abroad, including those from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
There is no "threshold" of the Moon Center: Quality certification promotes the improvement of quality.
With the pull of the "two-child economy" and the prosperity of the mother-and-child market, from the north to the third and fourth-tier cities, various grades of monthly clubhouses have sprung up in various places.
At present, the very hot monthly clubhouse meets the consumption needs of the masses, with fees ranging from tens of thousands of yuan to hundreds of thousands of yuan, but at the same time, it is in an awkward situation. So far, this institution has no threshold and there is still a gap in supervision.
The State Administration of Market Supervision recently launched a series of national "Quality Month" activities in 2018, and journalists came to a five-star monthly sub-center in Tianjin to visit the certification experience of maternal and infant care services.
The general moon center provides services such as newborn care, nutritious meals and post-partum repair and shaping.
In this monthly child center, the reporter saw that nurses check the breastfeeding situation of newborns on a daily basis, and professional carers provide fine nursing services such as bathing and touching for newborns.
At the same time, in order to meet the needs of new mothers, from wound care at the beginning of the month to beauty care at the middle and later stages of the month, nursing projects such as traditional Chinese medicine treatment and beauty care are provided to help mothers recover their slender figure.
A new mother who lived in the house told the reporter that she had booked the monthly club eight months in advance.
The service items of the monthly clubhouse have a direct impact on the comfort level and physical recovery of pregnant women during the monthly period. Some small monthly clubhouses can only provide some simple monthly services. There are hidden dangers such as non-standard disinfection and hygiene, easy cross-infection and single unscientific diet.
The person in charge of this monthly sub-center said that they are the only one of all five-star monthly sub-centers in Tianjin that has obtained B-level service certification.
"Although some customers did not understand the meaning of B-level certification at first, it is important for the long-term development of enterprises to push back the strict and standardized process management of enterprises through certification to benefit customers," he said.
Pan Lifen, Deputy Director of the Certification and Supervision Department of the State Administration of Market Supervision, said that service certification is a new type of certification system based on customer perception and paying attention to the quality management of the organization and the satisfaction of service characteristics. It is an important part of the national quality infrastructure and plays a positive role in enhancing the proportion of quality service supply and enhancing China's international competitiveness in services.
China started in 2004, and after more than 10 years of development, the service certification project has gone through a process of gradual development from scratch. A number of influential service certifications have emerged, such as financial service certification, maternal and infant care service certification, commodity after-sales service certification, e-commerce service certification and health service certification.
According to the statistics of the State Administration of Market Supervision, at present, China has more than 130 service certification institutions, more than 2,000 service certification personnel and nearly 8,000 valid certification certificates.
Pan Lifen said that it is necessary to further guide and promote the development of service certification, gradually expand the coverage of service certification in the fields of health, education, sports, finance and electric commerce, and help promote the supply-side reform and quality improvement of the service industry.
Hong KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong property prices fell for two consecutive months after peaking. The President of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Mr Chan Tak-lin, said on Monday that it is time to observe whether the housing market has entered a downward cycle. If confirmed, we can consider easing the tightening policy of counter-cyclical measures in due course.
Mr Chan also pointed out that if property prices were to be adjusted back, the people who would bear the brunt of the impact would be those who bought property at the peak of the housing market. However, it is expected that there will be a sharp drop in property prices, such as during the Asian financial crisis in 1997, and the opportunity for the public to sell property at a substantial price cut is much lower.
When leading a number of senior officials of the HKMA at the Legislative Council briefing, Mr Chan said that if it was confirmed that the housing market had entered a downward cycle, the measures could be relaxed in due course.
"However, we have only seen the data for a few weeks. It is still too early to relax. We still need more time to see whether the housing market has entered a downward cycle."
Since October 2009, the HKMA has launched eight rounds of counter-cyclical measures to significantly tighten the mortgage of various properties, including reducing the number of mortgages and the need for mortgage applicants to pass rigorous stress tests, so as to enhance the bank's risk management and earthquake resistance.
As Hong Kong officially entered the interest rate hike cycle, the Hong Kong private residential property price index peaked and fell for the second consecutive month in August-September, and the monthly decline in September widened to 1.44%.
However, the cumulative increase in the first three quarters of this year still reached 10.2%.
According to the data of the HKMA, the financial situation of households measuring the earthquake resistance of Hong Kong to financial risks is still healthy. In the second quarter of this year, the proportion of self-occupied households without mortgage in Hong Kong reached 66%, which is higher than the average of 60% in 2009-11. The average number of newly granted mortgages and the contribution-to-income ratio of newly granted mortgages were 47% and 34% respectively, representing a marked improvement from 64% and 41% respectively in 2009-11.
However, Mr Chan said that the high earthquake resistance does not mean that the people who have already bought a property will not be harmed by the economic downturn, as property valuation will fall, and those who buy a building during the peak period will bear the brunt.
Although the HKMA has tightened bank lending to mortgage lenders, homeowners can also obtain a high number of mortgage loans through mortgage insurance or mortgage loans provided by developers.
Mr Chan said that at present, together with the mortgage loan provided to the developer, the mortgage amount of the borrower can reach 85-90%. If the property price falls by 10%, there will be negative assets (i.e. the market value of the property falls below the level of the total outstanding mortgage loan).
However, Ruan Guoheng, Vice President of the HKMA, pointed out that the authorities estimated that the total amount of high-volume mortgages provided by developers accounted for only 2-2.5% of the total amount of bank mortgages, and the proportion was still low.
At the peak of negative assets in Hong Kong in 2003, the number of negative assets exceeded 100,000, accounting for 22% of the housing supply.
As of the third quarter of this year, Hong Kong recorded zero negative assets for seven consecutive quarters.
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 1 (Liu Hongxia and Ma Rui) E-commerce retail export enterprises welcomed another wave of positive tax burden on October 1, involving value-added tax and consumption tax exemption.
The Ministry of Finance, the State Administration of Taxation, the Ministry of Commerce and the General Administration of Customs have jointly issued a letter to make it clear that the tax exemption policy of value-added tax and consumption tax will be implemented on a trial basis for the export of goods that have not obtained valid purchase certificates by electronic commerce export enterprises in the comprehensive test area of cross-border e-commerce, while meeting the following conditions.
First, e-commerce export enterprises are registered in the comprehensive test area, and the export date, name of goods, unit of measurement, quantity, unit price and amount are registered on the cross-border e-commerce online integrated service platform at the place of registration.
Second, the export goods go through the e-commerce export declaration formalities through the customs at the locality of the comprehensive test area.
Third, the export goods do not belong to the goods for which the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation explicitly cancel the export tax refund (exemption) in accordance with the decision of the State Council.
The notice makes it clear that the General Administration of Customs regularly transmits the electronic information of the declaration list of e-commerce export commodities to the State Administration of Taxation.
The tax authorities of the comprehensive test areas shall strengthen the tax exemption administration of export goods according to the electronic information of the export commodity declaration list cleared by the State Administration of Taxation.
The circular points out that the specific tax exemption management measures shall be formulated by the commercial finance and commercial departments of the provincial tax departments.
The offices of the leading group for the construction of various comprehensive test areas and the competent commercial departments should make overall efforts to promote communication and coordination among departments and the implementation of relevant policies, accelerate the establishment of an e-commerce export statistics and monitoring system, and promote the healthy and rapid development of cross-border e-commerce.
Ordos, CNN.com, November 5 (Zhang Linhu), due to a disagreement over the distribution of money, a man in Liaoning Province killed his lover and dumped his body, then absconded to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
On May 5, the reporter learned from the Public Security Bureau of Dongsheng District, Ordos City, Inner Mongolia that after a joint investigation by the police of the two places, the man was successfully arrested.
On June 26, 2018, a woman disappeared in Anshan City, Liaoning Province, and her family alerted the local police.
After investigation and investigation by the police, this is not a simple case of missing persons. The missing person Bai is very likely to be killed by his lover Wang, and the police immediately set up a special task force to conduct further investigation.
On October 30, the task force found that the criminal suspect Wang may be hiding in Dongsheng District of Ordos City. The Dongsheng police immediately organized a lean police force to fully cooperate with the Liaoning police in the investigation of the case.
After five days of investigation, the police finally found out Wang's whereabouts and combed his relations in detail.
On November 4, the police of the two places worked together to arrest the criminal suspect Wang Mou in a digging machine accessories shop in Dongsheng District.
According to Wang's account, he had a relationship with the victim Bai's lover. Because Bai's sister had a large sum of money temporarily deposited in Bai's name, the two decided to take the money as their own.
On June 22, 2018, Wang and Bai had a disagreement over the disposal of the funds, and Wang went on to kill Bai in the rented house, decompose the body and throw it away.
At present, the criminal suspect Wang Mou has been handed over to the police in Anshan, Liaoning Province.
On-line operation of the "Green Development in Action" theme train of "Five Great Development and Beautiful Anhui"
The second theme train of "Five Development and Beautiful Anhui" - "Green Development in Action" - was officially put into operation on May 5.
In order to fully display the brilliant achievements made in the construction of the "Five Great Development and Beautiful Anhui," Hefei City Rail Company and the Golden Azalea Media and Technology Company jointly designed and produced the "Five Great Development and Beautiful Anhui" series of theme trains.
Among them, the first train, the "Innovative Development in Action" theme train, was officially put into operation on the Hefei City Rail Transit Line 1 on October 1.
The theme train on the line chose the blue-green color to symbolize the landscape, reflecting the sense of vitality, vitality and purity.
The publicity content highlights the core concept of the "Five Great Development and Beautiful Anhui" and 18 representative cases of green development achievements in the province, including the construction and development results of key green development projects such as the Jianghuai Canal Project, the forest growth system, the protection and development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt and the 10 million mu forest growth project.
In addition, three thematic trains, "Coordinated Development in Action," "Open Development in Action" and "Shared Development in Action," will also be put on line in the near future.
On October 1, the first day of the "Golden Week" of the Mainland National Day and the last day of the Hong Kong National Day public holiday, many Mainland residents took advantage of the holiday to visit and shop outside the country. Many Hong Kong residents who came to Shenzhen returned to Hong Kong on the same day. There was an "explosion" of passenger flow at various ports in Shenzhen. The Luohu and Shenzhen Bay ports opened 22 new self-service channels to enhance the efficiency of port clearance and facilitate the efficient and speedy clearance of passengers.
According to the data provided by the Shenzhen Border Inspection Station, as of 16: 00 p.m. on the same day, the number of people entering and leaving the Shenzhen Port had reached more than 429,000, and the number of transport tools had reached more than 16,800 (vessels, racks and columns). All ports have been busy and kept a good entry and exit order.
It is understood that, under the influence of many positive factors, such as the increase in the number of countries providing exit visa-free policies for Chinese citizens, the number of tourists taking advantage of the National Day holiday to travel to Europe and Southeast Asia and other countries for holiday shopping has continued to increase.
On the morning of January 1, the exit direction of Luohu, Shenzhen Bay, Huanggang and Futian ports welcomed the peak of passenger (car) flow, among which the peak of passenger flow at Luohu Port lasted from 9: 00 a.m. to 11: 00 a.m. and the peak of passenger (car) flow at Shenzhen Bay Port from 6: 30 a.m. to 13: 00 noon.
According to the report, in order to cope with the peak flow of inbound and outbound passengers (cars), the Shenzhen Border Inspection Station, in accordance with the unified deployment of the State Immigration Administration, launched the service mode during the peak period of passenger (car) flow, arranged overtime police to support the line of duty, opened full inspection channels in advance, guided passengers and vehicles to wait for inspection in an orderly manner, and ensured that the queue of Chinese citizens for entry and exit customs clearance did not exceed 30 minutes, while taking into account the efficiency of foreigners; and strengthened the maintenance of order in densely populated areas to ensure the safety and order of customs clearance.
At the same time, the Shenzhen Border Inspection Station reminds inbound and outbound passengers that they should pay attention to the validity period of their documents, visas and endorsement before travelling, rationally arrange their itineraries, try to avoid the peak passenger flow period and choose a suitable time and port to travel.
Passengers travelling on the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong High-speed Railway to Hong Kong must hold valid entry and exit certificates and visa endorsement. The high-speed rail ticket is only a travel voucher and cannot be used as an entry and exit document. If they are unable to leave for Hong Kong due to discrepancies in the documentation procedures, they should follow the guidelines of the police on border inspection duty and wait at designated places for the staff of the MTR Corporation to lead them to go through the travel procedures for returning to the Mainland.
Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic and difficult disease involving multiple organs throughout the body. In the past, it was considered to be an "incurable disease."
Because its pathogenesis is unknown, diagnosis and treatment is difficult, and there is no effective treatment.
Recently, Liu Wanli, a researcher of the School of Life Sciences of Tsinghua University, and Li Zhanguo, director of the rheumatism immunization center of the People's Hospital of Beijing University, jointly discovered that there is a molecular variation of human immunoglobulin that increases the susceptibility of systemic lupus erythematosus, and that this variation is involved in the regulation of immune B cells.
In short, the two teams confirmed that an abnormal immune molecule in the human body is an important cause of systemic lupus erythematosus.
According to Sun Xiaolin of the Peking University People's Hospital, one of the authors of the article, the Li Zhanguo team collected nearly 2,000 large samples of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and conducted research. It was found that the patients with immunoglobulin variation produced pathogenic cells and a wide variety and number of autoantibodies, and the incidence and severity of inflammation such as nephritis, arthritis, serositis and vasculitis increased significantly.
Through a variety of research methods, such as immune cell tracer, animal test and sequencing, Liu Wanli's team found the immune signal pathway activated by this immune molecular variation and the pathogenic mechanism of promoting B cells to secrete a variety of autoantibodies.
The reporter learned that the two teams combined strongly, gave full play to their respective advantages and realized the close combination of basic research and clinical application.
Liu Wanli's team is committed to the study of B lymphocyte immune recognition and immune activation, while Li Zhanguo's team has been engaged in the clinical study of systemic lupus erythematosus for a long time.
"This study is one of the results of the cooperation between the two teams for many years. It is also the first time that the academic community has recognized that the abnormal immunoglobulin gene will induce systemic lupus erythematosus, which has laid a solid foundation for further academic research and clinical targeted treatment."
This is not to protect the short, but to act in accordance with the law.
The lawyer went to court with an axe?
At first glance, the news was really exciting, and it also blew up in the legal circle.
The Chinese Law of Quanzhou City, Fujian Province, subsequently fined the lawyers involved 500 yuan and suggested in writing that the Quanzhou City Bar Association should investigate and deal with the matter.
According to the Beijing News, the Quanzhou Law Association issued an official notice recently, saying that the actions of the two lawyers do not involve illegal violations and will not be punished according to law.
According to various reports, the treatment of the Quanzhou Law Association is not short-term protection or confrontation, but has been recognized by the Quanzhou Central Court.
An incident that could have caused tension within the legal community was finally properly resolved.
The reversal of the matter stems from a more complete truth restoration: The axe carried by the lawyer involved is of the same style and model as the murder weapon of the defendant, but it has not been bladed. It is only used as supporting evidence in the cross-examination of evidence, and there is no intimidating act or subjective intention to "endanger the security of the court."
To judge whether the conduct of the lawyers involved is illegal or illegal, there are four very important details to pay attention to: First, the local court held two previous sessions and only showed photos of the axe. From the point of view of defense, it is necessary to show the original object of the axe; second, the axe was purchased only one hour before the court session, not because the lawyers did not want to seek the consent of the judge, but objectively failed to contact the judge; third, the whole axe was not used excessively or improperly; and fourth, the lawyers involved publicly acknowledged their mistakes and expressed their apologies to the court at the first time.
On the basis of these circumstances, it can be seen that the lawyer involved in the case "appeared in court with an axe" has nothing to do with bad behavior, but only for the purpose of defense.
After clarifying the whole fact, the Quanzhou Law Association did not push the boat with the water, but resisted the pressure and made a decision not to punish.
And this decision can stand the test of fact and law.
As for bringing the axe as a control tool to the court without the permission of the court, it is really easy to cause upset and misunderstanding.
For the sake of safety and prudence, the previous fine punishment and judicial advice of Quanzhou Central Court are also justifiable.
In order to safeguard the dignity of lawyers and prevent individual courts from making difficulties for lawyers, the Supreme Law issued the "Rules on the Security Inspection of the Judicial Police of the People's Court" in 2014, establishing the principle that lawyers do not need to carry out personal security inspection when they appear in court.
Since the issuance of the rule, the vast number of lawyers have led by example, and there have been few incidents that endanger the security of the court due to security loopholes.
In a very few cases such as Quanzhou, as long as communication is conducted in the spirit of mutual respect and understanding, it is not difficult to eliminate misunderstandings.
As a self-regulatory organization of the lawyer profession, the Bar Association undertakes the dual mission of punishing lawlessness and safeguarding legality.
In the past, individual law association organizations have been criticized for their emphasis on discipline and loss of protection.
The decision of Quanzhou Law Association, both in terms of process and results, is commendable and sets an example for more law associations to perform their duties correctly.
From October 1, which tax benefits will affect our purse strings?
Shanghai, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The new personal income tax law will come into effect on January 1, 2019. In order to enable the broad masses of the people to enjoy the tax reduction dividend as early as possible, from October 1, the actual wage and salary income earned by taxpayers will be deducted at the threshold of 5,000 yuan per month, and the new tax rate schedule will be applied.
With the landing of the New Deal, what benefits will affect the people's purse strings?
Positive one: The tax reduction of income from wages and salaries is obvious
Taxpayers who receive wages and salaries after October 1 may deduct the basic deduction of 5,000 yuan per month and apply the new tax rate schedule. Most taxpayers have different degrees of tax reduction, especially for middle and low-income earners.
According to the tax reduction table of different income groups, the monthly income after deducting "three risks and one gold" is 8,000 yuan, 10,000 yuan, 20,000 yuan and 50,000 yuan, and the tax payable after tax reform is 90 yuan, 290 yuan, 1,590 yuan and 9,090 yuan, respectively. Compared with the monthly threshold of 3,500 yuan, the corresponding tax reduction rates are 73.9%, 61.1%, 49.0% and 18.8% respectively.
It is worth noting that, due to holidays, the new basic deduction and tax rate schedule can be applied to the wages that should have been paid in October by various units in accordance with the law at the end of September.
To this end, the withholding client software uniformly promoted by the tax department has provided the corresponding tax calculation function, but the corresponding tax still needs to be declared and paid within the statutory declaration period.
Positive 2: The range of low-tax brackets has been significantly increased
In addition to raising the threshold, a new tax rate schedule will apply from October 1.
The seven-step tax rate on income from wages and salaries is the same as before and has not changed, but there has been a marked change in the range of tax rates. The range of the three low tax rates of 3%, 10% and 20% has been significantly expanded, and the range of the 25% tax rate has been reduced, while the range of the higher tax rates of 30%, 35% and 45% has remained unchanged.
It is worth noting that the tax law has also adjusted the tax rates of all grades of income from production and operation, among which the lower limit of the top 35% tax rate has been raised from 100,000 yuan to 500,000 yuan.
This means that individual industrial and commercial households and sole proprietorship partnerships will all benefit from the tax reform.
"From the measurement of individual tax reduction for Shanghai taxpayers in the previous period, the majority of taxpayers will fully feel the dividends of the tax reform, especially the obvious tax reduction for low- and middle-income people."
Lan Min, head of the personal income tax department of the Shanghai Tax Bureau of the State Administration of Taxation, said.
Third, the tax payment service is more convenient and optimized
Since the promulgation of the new Individual Income Tax Law, the Shanghai tax department has carried out a series of comprehensive and wide-ranging tax publicity actions.
On the one hand, we will carry out "one-to-one, point-to-point" policy guidance to key tax sources and key enterprises.
The Pudong New District Tax Bureau has visited large enterprises such as Apple Trade (Shanghai) Co., Alipay (China) Network Technology Co., Ltd. and Hongxing Meikailong Home Group Co., Ltd., which have a large number of employees, a large amount of withholding work and a large amount of tax payment, and the tax department has taken the initiative to provide guidance and answer questions. The Xuhui District Tax Bureau visited large labor enterprises in the region, such as Zhongzhi Financial Consulting Co., and Zhongzhi Shanghai Economic and Technical Cooperation Co., to collect the concerns of enterprises in a timely manner, respond to their demands and solve their difficulties.
On the other hand, we will carry out an "all-directional, multi-dimensional and three-dimensional" tax policy push for the vast number of citizen taxpayers.
The Shanghai tax official website, Weixin public number, Weibo and other channels are used to push the policy hot spots in time to ensure that the policy publicity is in place.
At the same time, from September 28, the Shanghai tax micro-letter public number went online on the 12366 intelligent consultation platform to carry out the "target-oriented" intelligent integrated tax reform publicity service through the "artificial + intelligent" tax service consultation.
On the evening of November 5, Beijing time, the English Football Association Network officially announced that former England captain Wayne Rooney will return to the England national team for the warm-up match between England and the United States on November 15.
In August last year, Rooney announced his retirement from the England national team.
Rooney has previously made 119 appearances for England and scored 53 goals. He is the first goalscorer in the history of the team and ranks second in the history of the number of appearances.
According to the news released by the English Football Association's website, this match with the United States team is to raise money for Rooney's Children's Charitable Foundation, and Rooney himself is very excited: "It is a great pleasure to represent England at Wembley again, and thank Southgate and the English Football Association for inviting me to help my foundation.
Playing for England is the greatest glory of my career, the 120th and will be my last appearance for England, and it will be a special memory for me.
The annual Yangcheng Lake Crab Culture and Tourism Festival kicked off on the 30th day. According to Gu Wenhua, secretary of the Party Committee of the Palestinian town, "the township of Yangcheng Lake hairy crabs," the annual economic output value of the town is nearly 3.8 billion yuan, with a net income of more than 600 million yuan.
Yangcheng Lake hairy crabs, also known as golden claw crabs, have a reputation as "king of crabs" due to their non-mud-stained body, commonly known as clear water hairy crabs, green shell and white belly, and greasy meat.
It has become a common practice for people to diet crabs in the golden autumn of Dangui Piaoxiang.
The hairy crab is the most well-known image spokesman of Bacheng.
Peeling crab shells, sucking crab feet, picking crab meat and dipping crab materials, diners feel the beauty of being in the south of the Yangtze River.
Crab Nong Jinwei said that more diners will spend more time in Bacheng this year, watching egrets preying on the edge of the vast Yangcheng Lake, watching the sunset, experiencing the fun of catching crabs and enjoying the slow-paced water life.
Due to the widespread introduction of large-scale seedlings in Pakistani cities and towns, the number of hairy crabs coming out of the water this year is much larger than before.
Chang Jianhua, a crab farmer who has been dealing with hairy crabs for nearly 20 years, is planning to export the crab seedlings and breeding technology of Yangcheng Lake hairy crabs to Thailand, so as to allow water township cuisine to cross national boundaries and promote cultural exchanges with overseas cuisine.
"Kunqu Town" is a cultural sign of Bacheng.
At present, there are five crab markets and a food street in Bacheng, including Crab Boat Court, Fisherman Lighting, Spring and Autumn Water City, Linhu Crab City and Zhengyi Balun Crab Market. There are as many as 1,300 restaurants and restaurants around Yangcheng Lake hairy crabs.
According to Gu Wenhua, "One Crab" attracts nearly 3 million tourists from home and abroad every year, and has also formed a two-horizontal, two-vertical and lively old street of Bacheng.
Many tourism products, such as the Kunqu theme post office, the painting concept book bar, the Pink Baby theme image museum, the Kunqu theme folk residence, the embroidery hall and the Qipao Pavilion, have appeared in succession. A number of celebrity studios, such as the Kunqu scholar Yang Shousong, the flute master Chen Dongbao, the famous Kunqu Xiaosheng Yu Yulin, the bamboo carving master Ni Xiaozhou and the folk song heritage man Lu Zhenliang, have been stationed in the old street, which has become the cultural core area of the "Kunqu town."
It is reported that during the Crab Culture and Tourism Festival, the 4th Kunqu Town-Bacheng Chongyang Qu will also open again, and Qu friends from all over the world will gather to relive the Yushan Ya Ji pageantry.
A number of cultural venues, including the Bacheng Historical and Cultural Exhibition Center, the Kunqu Promenade, Aying Ya Yuan, Chongwen College and the Kunqu Opera Grand Theatre, will also be unveiled, presenting the cultural charm of Kunqu Yuan Township, the township of Chinese calligraphy and the Yumi Water Township of Jiangnan.
The conclusion of a three-way trade agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico will bring new opportunities to 500 million people.
According to foreign media reports, the joint statement of Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland and US Trade Representative Lightshizer, published on the Canadian government website, said that the United States, Canada and Mexico reached a three-way trade agreement, which will be known as the "USMCA" (US-Mexico-Canada Three-Country Agreement).
Earlier, Canada's CTV News TV quoted senior US sources as saying that Canada and the United States had resolved their differences and reached an agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
The Washington Post, citing two sources with knowledge of the situation, reported that the agreement reached between the United States and Canada on September 30 will retain the North American Free Trade Agreement as a three-way trade agreement, and the heads of the three countries will sign a new agreement within two months.
"Today, Canada, the United States and Mexico have agreed on a new trade agreement - the US-Mexico-Canada Three-Country Agreement (USMCA), which will provide high standards of trade agreements for our workers, farmers and companies. It will lead to freer markets, fairer transactions and more sustainable economic growth. The agreement will strengthen the middle class, create high-paying jobs and bring new opportunities to about 500 million people," the statement said.
It is reported that the current North American Free Trade Agreement was signed by the United States, Mexico and Canada in 1994.
After his inauguration as President, Trump announced that he planned to reconsider the agreement and sign a new agreement.
The three countries will start the negotiation process in 2017.
The results of the election of the governor of Okinawa, which was held in advance because of the illness and death of former governor Weng Changxiong, were announced in the early hours of local time on Monday, and Danny Yucheng, who opposed the relocation plan of the US military base in Japan, was successfully elected.
The election was counted on September 30, and the final results showed that Yucheng received 396.632 million votes, the largest number of votes in the history of the election of the governor of Okinawa County, and more than 80,000 more votes than his main rival, Zhi Zhenchun.
A total of four candidates participated in the election, with a voter turnout of 63.24%, a decrease of 0.89 percentage points over the 2014 Okinawa County Governor election.
Yucheng told the media on Monday that the election results showed that the county people did not want to let Governor Weng's efforts in his lifetime be in vain. He will inherit Governor Weng's legacy and continue to make efforts to the Japanese government and the US government on opposing the relocation plan of the US military base and the closure of the Futenma base.
The US military base in Putian, located in Yinowan City, Okinawa County, has been criticized for a long time. The Japanese and US governments previously agreed to relocate it to the Banyungu area of the famous city, but the people of Okinawa strongly opposed it and hoped to move the base out of Okinawa completely.
As for the relocation plan strongly opposed by the county people and the request to revoke the permit for land reclamation along the Banyungu coast, Yucheng said that he did not stand in opposition and division with the central government at the beginning, and hoped that the two sides could fully exchange views and show their intention to resolve the issue through consultation.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also told the media on Monday morning that he seriously accepted the result and would make efforts to revitalize Okinawa and reduce the burden of the base.
Japanese Chief Secretary Yoshihide Suga said at a press conference on Monday that the government's policy on the relocation of US military bases as soon as possible has not changed.
At the same time, he also expressed his intention to talk with Yucheng.
Yucheng will officially take up the post of governor of Okinawa on the 4th of this month.
Since the mid-2000s, with the growth of China's demand for oilseeds, Paul Thomas, a farmer from North Dakota in the United States, has grown more and more soybeans in his field.
This transformation reached its peak this year, when he planted 1,600 acres of soybeans in 5,000 acres, reaching a scale never seen before.
But Thomas and many farmers like him plan to switch to the staple crops of the former agricultural areas of the United States: Corn and wheat in 2019.
The soybean planting area of American farmers exceeded that of corn this year for the first time in 35 years.
The reason for the plan to switch to other food crops is that American farmers face difficulties in selling soybeans in the context of US President Donald Trump's trade war against China.
China usually buys about 60% of US export soybeans, but because of the trade war, it has almost zero purchase of US soybeans in recent months, causing the price of soybeans to fall to a ten-year low.
Thomas intends to grow more wheat next year and hopes to earn more by reducing his dependence on crops that depend on Chinese demand.
Thomas said that the soybean price "brought us a painful blow."
He said that without Chinese buying demand, the spot price of soybeans near his farm is US $7.10 per bushel, while the price necessary to cover the cost is US $8.50.
The soybean planting area of American farmers reached a record high this year, and the harvest is expected to reach a record high.
At such a vulnerable moment, they were hit by a trade war.
In response to Trump's imposition of tariffs on imports of Chinese goods, China imposed import tariffs on imports of US soybeans in July.
The United States Department of Agriculture will issue its first estimate of the planting area next year, which is expected to include consideration of the impact of tariffs.
It is expected that the estimate will confirm the expectation of non-governmental organizations that the sown area of soybean will be reduced.
According to a report seen by Reuters, Informa Economics predicted on October 19 that the area under maize cultivation will increase by 4% to 92.7 million acres (37.5 million hectares) and the area under soybean cultivation will decrease by 7% to 83 million acres in 2019.
Informa also expects that the area under wheat cultivation in the United States will increase by 4%.
The area of soybeans planted before the implementation of retaliatory tariffs rose to 89.6 million acres this year, about 15 million acres higher than 10 years ago.
Since 2008, the area under maize cultivation has increased by less than 5 million acres to 89.1 million acres. This year, the area under wheat cultivation is 47.8 million acres, which is close to the lowest level in 100 years.
Aron Carlson, president of the Illinois Corn Planting Association, has a total planting area of 3,600 acres. He spent nearly half of his planting area on soybeans this year, but plans to reduce it in the future.
He said that he may increase the area of corn cultivation by up to 20% on his farm in northern Illinois, which is the largest soybean growing state in the United States.
The yield of soybean per acre is lower than that of corn, but it also requires less chemical fertilizer, which makes the overall planting cost of soybean lower.
If the farmers transfer to the final value corn, it may raise the cost, but it will benefit some enterprises, including the fertilizer seller of Andersons Inc.
Andersons Chief Executive Pat Bowe told Reuters that he expected that the conversion of maize would be beneficial to the use of chemical fertilizer.
Bayer is also expected to benefit from the conversion of farmers to maize.
Sutirawa, director of the Langman Airport Authority in Bangkok, Thailand, held a conference on 29 September to apologize for the beating of a Chinese citizen at the airport and said that Thailand welcomes Chinese tourists and that the relevant departments will strengthen management, raise service awareness and avoid similar incidents.
According to the report, on July 27, the security guard of Langman Airport had a physical confrontation with a Chinese man who had been refused entry.
Sutirava said that the security guard involved had committed a serious breach of discipline and that the Airport Authority had suspended him and set up an investigation committee to investigate the matter in accordance with the procedure. If the matter is true, the security guard will be dismissed.
At present, the Thai Immigration Bureau has arranged for the man to return to China by plane.
Sutirava expressed regret for the incident, which damaged the image of Thailand, and said that the Thai side attached great importance to the matter and was willing to do its best to reduce the impact of the incident on the beaten tourists, and would send a letter of apology to the party concerned through the Chinese Embassy in Thailand.
He said that Langman Airport is willing to provide convenience for Chinese tourists to Thailand and, together with the Thai Immigration Bureau, set up special entry channels for Chinese tourists at Bangkok's five major international airports, including Suvarnabhumi, Langman, Chiang Mai, Phuket and Hay.
He said that in the next step, the Airport Authority will rectify the landing visa area, specify the landing visa fee and improve the service quality and communication ability of the staff.
After the Chinese Embassy in Thailand learned of the incident, it contacted the party concerned for the first time to find out what had happened.
At the same time, it made representations to the heads of the Thai Immigration Bureau, the Airport Authority and the Ministry of Tourism and Sports, requesting the Thai side to thoroughly investigate the incident and severely punish the perpetrators, and will continue to maintain close communication with the Thai side, properly handle the matter and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the parties concerned.
Xinhua International Time Review: Safeguarding multilateralism and the unity of China's knowledge and practice.
At a time when unilateralism is surging against the current, international rules and multilateral order are under attack.
To some extent, the confrontation between unilateralism and multilateralism has entered a critical period.
As a responsible major country, China has worked with the international community to safeguard multilateralism and push it forward with the concept of following the general trend and the road of harmony and solid and strong actions.
In the face of the new situation and new challenges, China has issued a loud voice on the development direction and path of multilateralism.
As State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in his speech at the general debate of the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, multilateralism in the new era should adhere to the goal of win-win cooperation, be based on rules and order, be based on fairness and justice and be guided by effective action.
At the same time, China calls for the establishment of a global development cooperation pattern with the United Nations as the core, North-South cooperation as the main channel and South-South cooperation as a complement, and calls on all parties to work together to build a community of human destiny.
China's thinking and voice reflect the mainstream voice of the international community.
As President Espinosa of the 73rd session of the General Assembly said, in the current situation, "more than ever, the United Nations needs to promote multilateralism and safeguard the rules-based international system."
IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said that the international community should continue to firmly safeguard the multilateral trading system, adhere to international trade rules and resolve differences through consultation.
In recent years, with the adjustment of the balance of global economic and political power, a number of emerging markets and groups of developing countries have emerged and played a greater role in the major international multilateral mechanisms, providing a new development impetus for multilateralism facing headwinds.
Taking this dimension into consideration, the concept of multilateralism advocated by China, such as building a large family instead of piecing together small circles and adhering to the concept of co-construction rather than winner-take-all, is in line with the trend of the times. It is an inevitable choice to meet global challenges and solve world problems, and represents the common aspirations of most countries in the world.
There are advanced ideas and more solid actions.
The "Belt and Road" initiative put forward by China has become the largest international cooperation platform.
The international and regional cooperation initiatives launched by China, such as the joint construction of the "Belt and Road," the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the "16 + 1 Cooperation," promote international and regional cooperation, improve and supplement the existing international system and order, bring innovative vitality to multilateral cooperation and contribute to promoting the development of the international order in a more just and rational direction.
As a defender of the international order and a practitioner of multilateralism, China's actions are becoming more and more powerful in the multilateral arena of the United Nations.
We will provide good offices to international hot spots, address climate change, participate in peacekeeping operations, vigorously reduce poverty and help other countries to implement the 2030 sustainable development agenda.
As UN Secretary-General António Guterres said, China has become an important pillar of multilateralism.
When the "trust deficit" facing the world intensifies, and when the trend of populism and polarization is on the rise, it is the most urgent time for the world to need multilateral cooperation.
At such a historical juncture, the international community needs to join hands, turn consensus into action, resolutely safeguard multilateralism and jointly promote the building of a community of human destiny.
The first national standard 4K demonstration district of Guangdong was unveiled in the Jian Zhen Garden District of Haizhu District of Guangzhou City on September 30. On the same day, the province-wide 4K business of Guangdong Radio and Television Network was officially launched, and the opening ceremony of the 4K ultra-high-definition channel of the Central Radio and Television Station in Guangdong Province was held simultaneously.
The event of the day was jointly hosted by Guangdong Cable Radio and Television Network Co., Ltd. and the leading group of the joint construction and sharing of social governance in the Datang area of Haizhu District.
According to the deployment of the provincial government of the Guangdong Provincial Committee, the Guangdong Radio and Television Network has actively implemented the new digital family 4K action plan. In December 2017, it released the first national digital home gateway terminal product to support IPv6 and the first national radio and television to support the concurrency of 4 Lu Zhen 4K - "U-point home server" (with a 4K box and voice remote control with AVS2 standard), accelerated the construction of a new digital home demonstration area marked by 4K ultra-high-definition video, next-generation Internet and wired wireless fusion network applications, and actively participated in the construction of the 4K television network application area in Guangdong Province.
In 2018, the Guangdong Radio and Television Network launched a series of radio and television initiatives for the benefit of the people, and launched the "Radio and Television 4K Service Month" to promote the "U-point home server" throughout the province.
On the day of the event, the province-wide 4K business of Guangdong Radio and Television Network was officially launched, and the first 4K smart TV safe home sharing platform project based on 4K application was officially unveiled and put on line. The platform was jointly created by Guangdong Cable and the Office of the Leading Group for Co-governance and Shared Social Governance in Datang District of Haizhu District. The platform project relies on the 4K ultra-clear U-point home server of Guangdong Radio and Television Network to realize a new generation of intelligent family services based on cable TV network and integrate the relevant government services for the benefit of the people. The aim is to provide the public with a TV sharing platform that integrates publicity, education, the benefit of the people, the benefit of the people and entertainment.
Chen XiaoRui, chief engineer of the Guangdong Provincial Press, Publication and Radio and Television Bureau, said at the event that the event is a useful cooperation for the radio and television network enterprises to actively serve the central work of the Party committee government and the government to actively use the "Internet +" to create a "digital government" to serve the people. It is hoped that through cooperation and promotion, the Guangdong Radio and Television Network can help build a model of common governance and sharing social governance pattern in Haizhu District, Guangzhou and even the whole province.
The ceremony showed and popularized the safe home sharing platform of 4K smart TV and the new digital home application with 4K TV as the core.
The first phase of the "4K Smart TV Safe Home Sharing Platform" will have four modules: "Guangzhou Neighbourhood," "New Guangzhou People's Home," "Wisdom Community" and "Wisdom Family" on the line, and focus on exploring the construction of smart neighborhoods.
It is reported that the Guangdong Radio and Television Network has now opened five sets of 4K live broadcast channels, and the 4K ultra-high definition channel of the Central Radio and Television Station will be broadcast exclusively in the province on the National Day.
The report reads as follows: September 30 is the 5th National Martyrs' Day.
At 10 a.m. on the same day, Xi Jinping and other party and state leaders, together with representatives from all walks of life in the capital, attended the ceremony of laying flower baskets to the people's heroes to remember the heroes and martyrs.
This is the first anniversary of martyrs after the implementation of the law on the protection of heroes and martyrs in China.
Five years ago, the establishment of the Martyrs' Day on the eve of the National Day showed the great journey of the Chinese nation from suffering to glory. We should always wake up: "Where we come from and where we go."
General Secretary Xi Jinping profoundly pointed out that "abandoning the tradition and throwing it away is tantamount to cutting off his own spiritual lifeline."
"If we do not forget history, we can open up the future."
In advocating heroes and commemorating martyrs, we should always remember the history, continue the heroic spirit and rally the strong positive energy of national rejuvenation.
The quick review pointed out that Yingliang is the backbone of the nation.
To honor and pay tribute to martyrs is to make Yingliang a noble, holy and powerful eternal memory at the bottom of our hearts.
According to incomplete statistics, about 20 million martyrs died bravely for national independence, the liberation of the people, the prosperity and strength of the country and the happiness of the people.
Every martyr who died for the country will be remembered, and every spirit of loyalty to the country will be looked up to.
The establishment of a National Day of Remembrance for them and the organization of various forms of commemorative activities are precisely for the purpose of paying tribute to them in the name of the country, deeply remembering their great achievements and learning to carry on their valuable spirit of loving the motherland, being loyal to the people, selfless dedication and daring to sacrifice.
The Party committees and governments at all levels have improved the pension and preferential treatment system and continuously raised the level of pension and treatment, and the Party and the state have practiced the respect for heroes with practical actions.
Every year, countless people visit the Martyrs' Mausoleum, so that we can experience the deep feeling of the people's memory and feel the rejuvenation momentum rising in the national blood.
Advocating heroes, defending heroes, learning heroes and caring for heroes have become popular in the whole society.
At the end of the quick review, it is pointed out that today, when socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era, we can comfort the heroes who are sleeping underground: A strong China is rising in the East, and the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is becoming a reality in our hands.
Let us forge ahead with the strength of the heroic spirit and strive for the great goal!

The Fifth "Disability Voice Month" Comes to Pay Attention to the Sex Education of Disabled Youth - China New Network
In recent years, the topic of sex education for young people in China has been widely discussed, but the challenge of sex education for young people with disabilities is still difficult.
Recently, a seminar on the challenges and practical strategies of comprehensive sexuality education for persons with disabilities was held in Beijing.
How to provide sex education for disabled children and young people has become an important topic of this seminar.
The "Report on Sex-related Knowledge, Attitudes and Behavior of Disabled Children and Youth in China" released at the meeting showed that the proportion of disabled children subjected to sexual harassment and sexual assault was higher than that of healthy children.
For disabled children and adolescents, more attention is also paid to "sexual protection" in society.
The purpose of this seminar is to explore the promotion of comprehensive sex education for disabled children and young people in China from the aspects of family support, school education and institutional services, and to provide support to disabled children and young people at the source so that they, like others, have the right to enjoy love at home.
Experts believe that, for a long time, the Chinese public's understanding of the disabled groups has remained at a level that is not deep enough.
Under the influence of traditional concepts and other factors, China's comprehensive sex education for disabled people, especially disabled children and adolescents, is not deep enough.
However, in recent years, with the support of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and public welfare personnel, the practice and realization path of sexual and reproductive health education for the full-cycle and all-round development of disabled people in China has made encouraging progress.
The Report shows that although children and young people with visual, hearing, intellectual and physical disabilities will have more difficulties than the general population in acquiring sexual knowledge and understanding of intimate relations, they have generally developed into convenience and enrichment.
The "Seminar on Challenges and Practical Strategies of Comprehensive Sex Education for Persons with Disabilities," sponsored by the Shanghai People's Public Welfare Foundation and supported by the UNESCO Representative Office in China, the International Disability Alliance (France) Representative Office in Beijing and the United Nations Population Fund Representative Office in China, aims to jointly explore the practice and realization path of sexual and reproductive health education for all-round development of persons with disabilities in the context of the overall strategy of healthy China, and promote the understanding of the international policy of comprehensive sex education and the right to health of children and youth with disabilities by policy makers, educators, researchers, social service organizations and parents' representatives in the field of special education and integration. To conduct extensive exchanges on the sex education practices, strategies, challenges and resources of disabled children and young people in China, discuss and draw up a blueprint on how to carry out comprehensive sex education for disabled children and young people in the future, and form a support network.
Beijing, September 30 (Reuters) - The Central Bank of China released data on the scheduled net short-term outflow of foreign currency assets on Sunday, showing that the short position of the central bank in foreign currency against local currency forward contracts and futures contracts was zero for 12 consecutive months up to the end of August this year, and there was still no long position in that month.
According to the previous data of the central bank, as of the end of August last year, the central bank held a total of US $6.044 billion in short positions in foreign currency-to-local currency forward contracts and futures contracts, unchanged for the fourth consecutive month. The size of short positions denominated in SDR (Special Drawing Rights) was 4.276 billion SDRs.
Since then, the central bank's foreign exchange forward short position has been zero.
The central bank first published the data at the end of March 2016; the data showed that at the end of February 2016, the central bank's foreign currency-to-local currency forward contracts and futures contracts had a long position of US $2,438 million and a short position of US $28.9 billion.
The September data released at the end of October of the same year showed a net short increase of US $16.401 billion to US $45.301 billion for the first time.
The central bank has previously said that the forward and futures short positions of foreign currencies against local currencies mainly reflect the foreign exchange forward operations carried out by the central bank with commercial banks to meet the hedging needs of enterprises' foreign currency liabilities, and will continue to provide long-term risk-averse products in accordance with the principle of real demand. The forward operations of the central bank will have little impact on the size of future foreign exchange reserves.
On the evening of September 20 this year, on the K158 train, Qiao, a junior in Zhengzhou, went to Hebi by bus.
An old man on the train bought a no-seat ticket, but took her seat: "Shoot it."
After a two-hour drive, the conductor advised him that one hour was still invalid.
In the end, a male passenger in the same car could not bear to drag the master up.
From the point of view of public opinion, although most of the final results are that the bully is condemned by the public, punished by the public security department and even included in the integrity blacklist, the public still feels that it does not "relieve hatred": Why can't the bully be punished on the spot?
Why can't they stop their immoral or even illegal behavior on the spot, but can they be punished afterwards?
As for the unreasonable behavior of the "overlord," how can a male passenger pull him up?
The main reason is that only long-distance trains are equipped with passenger police, and short-distance trains are generally not; even if there are passenger police, the passenger police are more concerned about the possible rogue response of the bully and do not take compulsory removal measures.
The repeated bullying incidents have made people realize that the bully must be forcibly removed or even punished on the spot in order to act as a deterrent.
This requires that our train police should dare to take strong measures in a timely manner, and trains without police should be equipped with police as soon as possible in order to prevent and crack down on illegal acts in a timely manner.
On October 1, the first day of the National Day holiday, vehicles soared in the direction of Songpan, Maoxian County, via the Qiang Autonomous County of Beichuan, Sichuan Province.
At around 13: 00, the Beichuan traffic police received a call for help, saying that his family had been involved in a traffic accident in Songpan. Due to the limited medical conditions in the area, they urgently needed to be sent to Mianyang for treatment.
Coinciding with the implementation of one-way traffic control on the Tangjiashan Yan Sehu Huanhu Road in Beichuan, I would like to ask the traffic police to release 120 emergency vehicles.
After receiving the call for help, the police on duty quickly reported the situation to the brigade. After the captain, Huang Xuemin, had a brief understanding of the situation, he immediately arranged for the police on duty at the control point to contact the caller and requested that all efforts be made to do a good job of escort.
"At that time, there were more than 1,000 vehicles entering the controlled road section. After contacting 120 emergency vehicles, it is expected that the time of arrival in Beichuan will be around 15: 00, and we will make arrangements for deployment immediately."
According to Gala Wei, the head of the Yurie Squadron of the Beichuan Traffic Police, emergency vehicles need to make a detour from the Tangjiashan Yan Sehu Huanghu Road and the road is steep and narrow. In order to prevent the vehicles that have entered the road from driving in parallel, the traffic police implemented segmental control of the vehicles at the beginning, middle and end of the road one hour in advance, and reminded all passing drivers to give way to one side of the road and stagger the emergency vehicles.
Subsequently, the police of the beating drum squadron also temporarily stopped the vehicles from entering the controlled road section and queued for the 120 emergency vehicles that were about to arrive.
At around 15: 00, a Sichuan U-plate ambulance drove into Beichuan territory, and the Beichuan traffic police sent a police car to drive down the road to escort the emergency vehicle all the way into the controlled road.
It is understood that some places on the Huanghu Road can only be passed by one vehicle, and the police carried out temporary control of these places in advance, ensuring the smooth passage of 120 emergency vehicles.
The traffic police contacted the village committee in advance, borrowed the village road to make a detour and banned social vehicles from entering the village.
"It took only 40 minutes for the Beichuan traffic police to receive 120 emergency vehicles and drive into the normal road of 302 Provincial Road."
According to the normal situation, the whole passage time needs to take four hours.
"This arrangement has successfully secured valuable treatment time for the patients."
It is reported that at 17: 20, the critically ill patients were sent to Mianyang in time for treatment.
The number of confirmed deaths caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose rapidly to 832. The authorities fear that the number will rise because it is difficult for rescue workers to provide assistance to remote areas that have lost contact.
Of particular concern is Dongra, an area north of Baru with a population of 300,000, which is close to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Two other areas have lost contact with the outside world since Friday.
"We have not yet received reports from the other three regions."
Communications and electricity are still cut off.
Nugroho said that five foreigners were among the missing, three of whom were French, one Korean and one Malaysian.
832 people died as a result of the earthquake and tsunami.
Indonesian Vice President Kara said the death toll could rise to thousands.
Earlier, Indonesian President Joko Widodo had surveyed the disaster area and called on the people to be patient.
Reuters November 4 - The Daily Telegraph reported on Sunday that British Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab privately demanded the right of the UK to leave the "safeguard" arrangement on the Irish border after three months.
According to the report, Raab made the request to Simon Coveney, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Ireland, at a private meeting in London last Tuesday.
The report pointed out that the request was in "clear contradiction" with the statement made by David Lidington, Minister of the British Cabinet Office, during his visit to Dublin three days later.
The UK's Department for Brexit Affairs said it would not comment on private meetings.
At 8: 05 a.m. yesterday, two pickpocketing suspects were caught while pickpocketing from the Yongding Gate Station of the No. 20 bus to the Zhuchengkou Station.
Two pickpocket men cut the passenger's coat pocket and stole 800 yuan of cash from it, so that the police officers who had been squatting nearby could catch it.
This is the first case of pickpocketing uncovered by the Beijing police during the National Day.
At more than 5 o'clock yesterday morning, the anti-theft investigators of the Beijing Public Security Mobile Investigation Team arrived at the scheduled position.
According to past experience, the places where the flow of people is concentrated, the bus hub and the bus subway line, including the people watching the raising of the flag in Tiananmen Square, are the key areas of their work.
In the flow of people, plain-clothed police officers calmly observed the passing crowd.
At more than 7 a.m., the investigators who were squatting at the bus stop found two suspicious men following a male passenger onto the No. 20 bus from the Yongding Gate station.
In the car, two suspicious men, left and right, sandwiched the male passenger in the middle, and one of them tried to give cover to the other.
However, they did not know that their every move had already fallen into the eyes of the plain-clothes police who were watching.
"Catching the thief and catching the stolen goods," the plainclothes police officers pay attention to the fire. While waiting for the man to start the theft, the police officers stared at the man who was ready to pick up the stolen goods, and were caught by the investigators at one stroke after they picked up the stolen goods.
A reporter from the Beijing Morning News saw that the police seized 800 yuan in cash from the theft suspect.
"They took the money from the passenger's clothes pocket."
The police pointed to a broken coat pocket and said, "They cut it open here and stole 800 yuan from a passenger who came to Beijing. When we caught them, the money had just been put into their own pocket."
The reporter learned that in order to catch the two men, the plainclothes police followed them for a full hour and finally caught them in one fell swoop when they committed the crime.
The two suspects are currently being examined by the police.
The plainclothes police told reporters that the question of who is suspicious in the crowd is very simple for the police.
"If you catch more thieves, you will find that their eyes and manners are different from those of ordinary passengers. In addition to staring at people's pockets and backpacks, they also like to drill into the crowd instead of hiding from people."
The police also told reporters that the suspect often has no purpose and likes to wander around the station. After finding the object of pickpocketing, he will follow the car.
"These are all words of experience. It is natural to know that plain clothes have been dry for a long time."
In addition, the police also suggested that "the outer pocket is the most convenient and easy to be stolen."
During the ride, you should pay attention to your own belongings to prevent them from being stolen.
On September 30, the official microletter of the Propaganda Department of the Tongliao Municipal Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region announced that three people died as a result of the driving of Han Bai Yila, a member of the Standing Committee and the Propaganda Minister of the Tongliao Municipal Committee.
On the afternoon of September 29, Han Bai Yila, a 52-year-old member of the Standing Committee of the Ke Zuo Zhongqi Flag Committee and Minister of Propaganda, was driving a small ordinary bus and a sanitation electric tricycle in a traffic accident 1 km south of the Shengbei Road Racecourse in the Tongliao Development Zone. Two people were killed on the spot, one was seriously injured and died after emergency rescue.
It is understood that Han Bai Era, the suspect in the accident, has been detained by the public security organ for causing casualties due to dangerous driving under the influence of alcohol, and the Tongliao Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision has intervened in the investigation.
At present, the incident is under further investigation.
The reporter learned from the Traffic Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security of China on October 1 that the traffic flow of roads and expressways around major cities increased significantly on the first day of the National Day holiday. As of 17: 00 on the same day, with the exception of a few nodal road sections where vehicles were still moving slowly, the traffic of expressways and national provincial roads was generally stable and orderly. No one road traffic accident involving more than five dead people was reported throughout the country, and no one accident involving more than three dead people was reported in 29 provinces, regions and cities.
On the morning of the same day, the travel peak was generally ushered in everywhere, and the traffic flow of roads and expressways around major cities increased significantly. Local road sections and nodes such as toll stations, service areas, bridges, tunnels and interchanges appeared to be slow-moving queues in different degrees due to excessive traffic flow, road bottlenecks and scraping accidents, especially in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta and Chengdu-Chongqing regions. The traffic flow dropped in the afternoon and road traffic gradually resumed.
It is known that on the first day of the holiday, the national traffic police launched the wartime service of holiday traffic security, investing a total of more than 190,000 police personnel and 70,000 police vehicles, closely patrol and control, strictly control the traffic order, timely channel traffic, quickly handle accidents, widely publicize and guide, and take more measures to ensure the safety and smooth flow of roads on the first day of the holiday.
It is expected that some of the traffic flow in and out of the city expressway and national provincial road will continue to operate at a high level on February 2, while the traffic flow in tourist scenic spots will increase significantly, and traffic congestion and safety risks will increase.
British Prime Minister Theresa May on Sunday called on her party to unite behind her Brexit plan, directly calling on critics to support it, saying that the free trade deal they want is the core of her Brexit plan.
On September 30, 2018, British Prime Minister Theresa May went to attend the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, England.
At the beginning of this exciting annual meeting of the Conservative Party, Theresa May's plan was again attacked by two former cabinet ministers, including former Foreign Secretary Johnson, who called Theresa May's plan "deranged."
But she also received strong support from other pro-Brexit ministers, who "praised Theresa May as one of the most polite people," and International Trade Secretary Fox and Foreign Secretary Hunt also directed their anger at the EU.
Theresa May's already fragile leadership came under further pressure this month when the EU rejected parts of the so-called "Chex" plan.
But Theresa May took a positive view of these consultations, saying that she was ready to consider the doubts of the EU.
"My message to my own party is that let's work together to find the best deal for the UK," said Theresa May.
Johnson, a former British foreign secretary, called Theresa May's plans "deranged" and attacked her for not having confidence in Brexit.
He and former Brexit Secretary David Davis are pushing for a Canadian-style free trade agreement with the EU.
Theresa May, for her part, said that the proposal would enable Northern Ireland to implement different tariff provisions, which would be tantamount to the separation of Northern Ireland from the United Kingdom.

On March 30, Tencent announced the official launch of a new round of overall strategic upgrading, and the organizational structure ushered in a new round of optimization and adjustment after a six-year hiatus. On the basis of the original seven major enterprise groups (BG), it was reorganized and consolidated into six, and said that the adjustment did not involve layoffs.
Tencent's new six major enterprise groups.
After six years, two new enterprise groups have emerged.
It is understood that the new enterprise group not only maintains the advantages and characteristics of deep cultivation in the vertical field, but also retains the original enterprise development enterprise group (CDG), interactive entertainment enterprise group (IEG), technical engineering enterprise group (TEG) and micro-credit enterprise group (WXG); it also highlights the integration effect and establishes a new cloud and intelligence industry group (CSIG), platform and content enterprise group (PCG).
The reporter noted that Tencent's original mobile Internet enterprise group (MIG) and the former network media enterprise group (OMG) have all disappeared, especially OMG, which is well known to the outside world.
Tencent said that the newly established platform and content enterprise group (PCG, or Platform & Content Group) will organically split and restructure the sectors of the former social network enterprise group (SNG), the former mobile Internet enterprise group (MIG) and the former network media enterprise group (OMG), which are highly related to social platform, traffic platform, digital content and core technology and have a high degree of integration.
The newly established Cloud and Smart Industries Group will integrate industry solutions such as Tencent Cloud, Internet +, smart retail, education, health care, security and LBS to promote the digital upgrading of the industry.
Ma Huateng, chairman and chief executive of Tencent's board of directors, said that the second half of the Internet belongs to the industrial Internet. In the first half, Tencent provides high-quality services to users through connectivity. On this basis, in the second half, we will help the industry and consumers to form a new and more open connection ecology.
In response to the "layoff" rumors: It is clear that there will be no layoffs.
After Tencent released the news of the organizational structure adjustment, it was reported that the adjustment would involve layoffs.
"It can be made clear that this organizational restructuring will not involve layoffs. We will translate the various business modules as a whole and combine them before optimizing them," Tencent told CNN.com.
Macron pushes France to protect French skills for the application of "long stick bread" - CNN.com
On October 1, according to Reuters, European countries have successively applied for their own unique diet. Following Belgian beer and pancakes in Naples, Italy, France recently plans to apply for long stick bread to be included in the list of intangible cultural heritage of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
It is reported that the plan was promoted by French President Emmanuel Macron and supported by the French Bread and Pastry Industry Union.
They pointed out that many of the long-stick breads now sold are made of rapidly frozen dough produced on a large scale, adding materials other than flour, water, yeast and salt. Traditional handmade bakeries are gradually declining, and it is hoped that the listing will protect the world-renowned French skills.
UNESCO will hold its annual meeting in Mauritius in late November to review the list of intangible cultural heritage.
Five people were killed when an illegal migrant boat sank in the Aegean Sea of Turkey.
Istanbul, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Turkish media reported that an inflatable boat carrying illegal migrants capsized in the waters of the Aegean Sea of Turkey on the same day, killing at least five people.
The report said that the inflatable boat, which was scheduled to go to a Greek island, sank near the Enez area of the Edirne province in northwestern Turkey on the same day, and the cause of the sinking is unknown.
At present, the number of illegal immigrants on board the sunken inflatable boat is not known.
As it is estimated that there are still people trapped in the sea, the relevant search and rescue operations are still continuing.
The Aegean Sea was once the preferred route for illegal migrants to be smuggled to the European continent via Turkey.
After Turkey controlled it in accordance with the agreement signed with the EU in March 2016, the number of people smuggling through this channel has been greatly reduced.
But since the beginning of this year, the number of people smugglers on this channel has rebounded.

Chinese tourists were beaten at Thai airport: The attacker was dismissed and the president of the airport was removed from his post.
On September 30, according to the Thai headline news network, the video of Chinese citizens being beaten at Bangkok's Langman Airport recently attracted wide attention.
At 2: 00 p.m. local time, Su Linwa, president of Langman Airport of the Thai Airport Company, explained that airport security had started to hit tourists and apologized.
On the other hand, it is reported that Thai Deputy Prime Minister Bai Yi attaches great importance to the matter and has ordered the dismissal of the airport staff involved in the accident and the dismissal of the president of Longman Airport.
According to the head of the Airport Authority, at that time, the Chinese tourist was dissatisfied with being refused entry and did not want to obey the management and stay in the restricted area of repatriation, so he had a shoving and physical confrontation with the security personnel.
At present, the Airport Authority has suspended the security guard.
The incident has had an impact on Thailand's tourism image. Langman Airport apologized for the incident. In order to try its best to make up for the loss, the next step will be for the airport to convey its deep apologies to the Chinese tourist party who was attacked through the Chinese Embassy.
Finally, airport President Su Linwa said: The vast number of Chinese tourists are still welcome to visit Thailand, and now more help and convenience have been provided to Chinese tourists entering Thailand, including the opening of special courtesy channels for Chinese passports at the time of entry, including 18 at Suvarnabhumi Airport, 21 at Langman Airport and 18 at Phuket Airport, 8 at Chiang Mai Airport and 10 for Chinese tourists at Heai Airport.
The Thai headline news network learned from the new Director-General of the National Immigration Bureau of Thailand and the former Deputy Director-General of the Thai Tourism Police, Major General Surache, that Thai Deputy Prime Minister Bai Yi attached great importance to the matter and had ordered the dismissal of the airport staff involved in the accident and the dismissal of the President of Longman Airport.
In recent years, there have been many incidents of unqualified plastic runways on campus.
To this end, the Ministry of Education issued a notice requiring that the new national standard must be implemented on the surface sports fields of synthetic materials for primary and secondary schools to be delivered for use after November 1 this year.
The compulsory national standard, "Surface Sports Ground of Synthetic Materials in Primary and Secondary Schools," was led by the Ministry of Education and drafted with the participation of 26 scientific research institutes and testing institutions. After more than two years of revision, more than 100 expert meetings were organized during the period, as well as field visits and sample tests throughout the country, and countless verification experiments were collected on the products of hundreds of enterprises on the market.
According to the old national standard in 2005, the reporter found that the new national standard not only changed from the "national recommended standard" to the "national mandatory standard," but also added many contents, including thickness requirements, physical properties, aging resistance, inorganic filler content requirements, anti-skid colloidal polymer content requirements, the limit of harmful substances in surface finished products and the limit of harmful substances in non-solid and solid raw materials.
In particular, it is worth mentioning that the new national standard has set a limit on the harmful substances that may be produced in the construction of plastic runway on campus, from the original 7 items to 18 items, and has stipulated the limit of volatile organic substances on the runway after construction in accordance with the home improvement standards.
If the "limits and odor requirements of harmful substances in cast-in-place and prefabricated surface products" clearly specify the release amount of harmful substances, the total volatile organic compounds should not be higher than 5 mg / m3, formaldehyde should not be higher than 0.4 mg / m3, carbon disulfide should not be higher than 7 mg / m3, benzene should not be higher than 0.1 mg / m3, and the odor level should not be higher than 3.
The new national standard also makes detailed provisions on the sampling requirements, inspection rules and judging rules of plastic runways in primary and secondary schools.
In addition, the artificial lawn on campus has also been included in the compulsory testing scope of the national standard for the first time.
In the near future, all localities should carry out special work deployment on the implementation of the new national standard and submit the implementation of the new national standard to the Department of Sports Health and Arts Education of the Ministry of Education within the year.
On the afternoon of September 30, the "National Table Tennis Civil War" was staged in the final arena of the 2018 Women's Table Tennis World Cup.
In the end, Zhu Yuiling, a teammate of Grand Slam winner Ding Ning who fought at home at 4: 0, won the Women's Table Tennis World Cup again after four years, which is the 21st time that Chinese women's table tennis has won the title of the event.
Ding Ning and Zhu Yuiling are both teammates and friends, and both sides are quite familiar with each other's techniques and tactics.
Whether preparing for the war or warming up before the game, both sides followed suit.
Entering the final, the two men agreed that they had completed the task of the competition.
But the contest between Ding Ning and Zhu Yuiling in the competition can be regarded as a sword and a sword.

In the end, Ding Ning beat her teammate Zhu Yuiling and won her third World Cup title. She expressed satisfaction with her performance: "A champion is very important to every athlete.
I didn't think of this before the game, but said that it was very satisfying to play in the final.
Zhu Yuiling, a Sichuan sister who fought at home, won a silver medal and did not complete the goal of defending her title. Talking about whether the enthusiastic audience at home would cause invisible pressure on herself, she said, "I think I can handle the whole game in terms of pressure. Today Ding Ning played very well, resulting in her not finding a rhythm."
To activate rural consumption, we should rely on the normalization mechanism to purify the market, guide the demand for healthy consumption and enhance the sense of acquisition of farmers' consumption.
The data show that the consumption potential of rural residents has been continuously released, and the retail sales of rural consumer goods increased by 10.5% in the first half of this year, an increase of 1.3 percentage points higher than that of urban areas.
During a visit to a poverty-stricken village in a western county, there was only one convenience store in the village. When they entered the store, some goods seemed familiar. "Goldfish" was marked as "Jinlong oil," "Wangzi" became "Wangmilk" and "Shanzhai" had a lot of goods.
Over the years, similar phenomena have frequently revealed that some rural fake and low-quality commodities are near famous brands, with similar names, similar packaging and falsehood, which make it impossible to prevent them.
According to a consumption survey report issued by a city in the west, the problem of ultra-fake goods in rural areas is serious, and 66% of users have bought fake goods in the supermarket under the township line, of which food accounts for more than half.
The relevant departments have rectified the rural market, shouting and fighting year after year. Why is "Li Ghost" still fighting repeatedly?
Unlike the urban market, the relatively weak awareness of farmers' rights protection, coupled with the fact that many rural areas are remote and in blind areas beyond the reach of regulatory forces, has created a breeding ground for fake and low-quality commodities.
A commodity is multi-headed, some departments are in charge of prices, some are in charge of production, some are in charge of the market, and their functions are cross-cutting. They take annual leave and concentrate on managing a gust of wind. Fake goods escape the spotlight and come out slowly. Just after the old vacation, new ones come out again.
In the absence of a long-term regulatory mechanism, the rural market is difficult to purify, the illegal cost is low and the benefits are large, which has led some illegal traders to use the crooked idea of "going to the mountains and going to the countryside," and some rural areas have become "waste markets."
From food and clothing to well-off, the vast number of farmers are moving towards development-oriented consumption.
A few days ago, the Party Central Committee and the State Council issued the "Several Opinions on Improving the Mechanism of Promoting Consumption System to Further Stimulate the Consumption Potential of Residents," in which they proposed to promote the upgrading of the consumption ladder of rural residents, with the aim of enabling the vast number of farmers to "consume" "willing to consume" and "dare to consume" so that rural consumption can really flourish.
On the one hand, it is necessary to deepen reform, eliminate the malpractice of multi-door and multi-head management of market supervision, adapt to local conditions, improve the food safety and product quality supervision network, and continuously reduce the space for making and selling fake products in rural areas.
On the other hand, we should strengthen law enforcement, open up the "capillaries" of supervision, and never allow fake and inferior products to breed and spread in rural areas.
Severe punishment of pit farmers is the only way to protect farmers. No matter how hidden the counterfeiters are, they should not be the reason for the breeding of fake and low-quality commodities. The relevant departments should clearly define their responsibilities, and the grass-roots supervisory force should sink. If any link goes wrong, they should be held accountable, so that the counterfeiters and sellers have no place to hide.
We will strictly control market access, carry out strict qualification examination for producers and operators, control market circulation, let products come and go straight and clear, and find ways from the source and root to enable legal distributors to operate in peace and let farmers buy at ease.
To activate rural consumption, we should guide the demand for healthy consumption.
With the upgrading of consumption, many farmers not only seek to eat enough and eat well, but also pursue high-quality life such as culture and health. They cannot refer to the rural market as "low-quality" and "cheap" paintings.
This requires promoting the extension of e-commerce coverage to the vast rural areas, unblocking the two-way linkage sales channels between urban and rural areas, promoting the integration of the offline industrial development platform and the online electronic commerce trading platform, and supporting the expansion of the new mode of consumption to the rural market; promoting the organic integration of trade and logistics with leisure agriculture, rural tourism and product processing in towns and villages where conditions permit; improving the modern rural circulation network system, optimizing the integration of stock facilities and resources, and effectively reducing the rural circulation cost.
To create a clear and secure market environment for rural areas, so that farmers do not worry about their consumption, rural consumption can become more and more prosperous, so as to enhance the sense of acquisition and happiness of farmers' consumption.
From November 1, China will reduce the most-favoured-nation tariff rate for some commodities, and the total tariff level will be reduced to 7.5%
According to the decision of the 26th executive meeting of the State Council, the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council issued a notice on the 30th day to reduce the most-favoured-nation tariff rate of some commodities from November 1, 2018.
According to the "Notice of the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council on Reducing the Import Tariff of Certain Commodities," in order to meet the needs of industrial upgrading, reducing the cost of enterprises and meeting the multi-level consumption of the masses, the most-favoured-nation tariff rate of some industrial products and other commodities will be reduced from November 1 this year.
There are a total of 1,585 tax items, accounting for about 19% of the total number of tax items in China, and the average tax rate decreased from 10.5% to 7.8%, with an average decrease of 26%.
The tax reduction mainly involves textiles; stone, ceramics and glass products; some steel and base metal products; mechanical and electrical equipment and parts, such as metal processing machinery, textile machinery, construction machinery, transmission and transformation equipment, electrical equipment, instruments and instruments; resource commodities and primary processing products, such as non-metallic minerals, inorganic chemicals, wood and paper products, precious jade and so on.
At the same time, with the reduction of the total tariff level, especially the import tariff on drugs and consumer goods for daily use, the tariff rate of import tax on imported goods will be reduced accordingly.
In order to implement the decision-making and deployment of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, China has implemented zero tariffs on the vast majority of imported drugs from May 1 this year, reduced import tariffs on automobiles, parts and components and some consumer goods for daily use from July 1, and implemented the third step of tax reduction on products covered by the information technology agreement.
The reporter learned from the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council that since the beginning of this year, after successive independent adjustments, China's total tariff level will be reduced from 9.8% in the previous year to 7.5%, with an average reduction of 23%.
The appropriate reduction of tariffs is conducive to promoting the balanced development of foreign trade and promoting a higher level of opening to the outside world. It is also conducive to the overall utilization of international and domestic resources and the promotion of domestic supply-side structural reform.
The relevant officials of the committee said that this year marks the 40th anniversary of reform and opening-up, and that the initiative to reduce the overall tariff level is a practical action to implement the spirit of the important speech made by General Secretary Xi Jinping at the Boao Forum for Asia. It is also an important measure for China to further expand its opening-up and actively expand its imports in accordance with its own high-quality development needs. This action and initiative shows that China will unswervingly pursue a mutually beneficial and win-win opening strategy and, while enhancing its own development drive, let China's development better benefit the world.
On September 29, the launch of the regional public brand of "Huanxiang people" agricultural products in Huanxian County, Gansu Province was held in Nankai District, Tianjin City.
The Red Army millet, black beans, mountain children's pastoral song black goat, hardcover tartary buckwheat tea, paper-cut leather shadow book and pure handmade slippers... One piece of beautifully packaged agricultural products is neatly placed on the exhibition stand. They have a common brand name called "Huanxiang people."
"Building a regional brand of" Huanxiang people "has effectively solved the development bottleneck of" many and scattered, small and weak "agricultural products in Huanxian County, and has become a powerful carrier to fight poverty." On 29 September, the regional public brand launch of "Huanxiang people" agricultural products hosted by Gansu Huanxian County was held in Nankai District of Tianjin City.
Located at the junction of the three provinces and regions of Shaanxi and Ganning, Huan County has a long history and rich resources as "the advanced county of national grain production," "the township of China's small miscellaneous grain" and "the township of China's shadow."
Local snacks such as lamb meat, yellow rice wine, buckwheat chopped noodles and soft oat noodles are often remembered by tourists in other countries.
With the continuous improvement of China's urbanization level and the rapid increase of urban population, a large number of rural young people have left their hometown to start urban life.
Yang Qiaojia, an expert on Chinese agricultural brand research, said, "Now that urban life is fast-paced and stressful, more and more people are beginning to miss the rural life when they were young. However," the most beautiful memory is the countryside when they can't go back to their hometown. "The brand design of" people around the countryside "is named after the rural feelings and homesickness of people wandering around the county."
Huanxian County has special climatic conditions, long sunshine time, large temperature difference between day and night, and unique conditions for the cultivation of small miscellaneous grains.
The territory is rich in more than 20 kinds of small miscellaneous grains. It is the township of small miscellaneous grains in China, with the highest output in Gansu and the highest quality in the country.
Wang Xiaoli, a girl from Huanxian who went to school in Tianjin, participated in the presentation as a volunteer. She said, "The people in her hometown are the closest and the taste of her hometown is the most beautiful. The" Huanxiang people "brand has evoked too many of our homesickness and memories, and what she does not forget is the food there. She hopes that the" Huanxiang people "brand will go further and become bigger."
Dr. Tan Bin, a researcher of the Scientific Research Institute of the National Food and Material Reserve Bureau, said that through the testing of more than 900 sets of index data, the testing data of buckwheat, tartary buckwheat and black beans and other agricultural products in Huanxian County have outstanding advantages, and the content of many physiological active substances of miscellaneous grains is higher than the standard data. "Huanxiang people" have the inherent advantage of seizing the high-end domestic miscellaneous grain market.
Chai Chun, secretary of the Huanxian County Committee, said that through the release of the "Huanxiang people" brand, it can further enhance the quality, standardization and large-scale innovative development level of Huanxian high-quality agricultural products, which is conducive to shaping a good overall image of Huanxian agricultural products and quickly enhance the visibility, competitiveness and added value.
Canada's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 0.2% in July compared with the previous month, which was higher than expected, raising market expectations that the Bank of Canada will raise interest rates next month.
If it does raise interest rates, it will be the fifth time that the central bank has raised interest rates in a little more than a year.
Analysts interviewed by Reuters had estimated an increase of 0.1%.
Statistics Canada said Friday that 12 of the 20 industries achieved growth.
The data is noteworthy because the central bank predicted earlier this month that temporary factors may drag down the third quarter GDP data.
Bank of Canada President Poloz promised Thursday that the central bank will continue to raise interest rates gradually and will pay close attention to economic data.
The Bank of Canada will next announce its interest rate decision on October 24.
Due to the strengthening of the Canadian economy and the near-record low unemployment rate, the Bank of Canada has raised interest rates four times since July 2017.
Stephen Brown, a senior Canadian economist at Kaijin Macro, said that the GDP growth of the country's economy in the third quarter is expected to reach about 2% year-on-year.
"This will be higher than the 1.5% expected by the Bank of Canada, so it will be another reason to expect the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates next month," he said in a report.
The overnight index swap showed that the market's estimate of the probability of the Bank of Canada raising interest rates in October rose from 76.46 per cent to 78.27 per cent.
For the first time in 65 years, the two Koreas jointly inspected the entrance of the Han River to the sea
The Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Korea confirmed on Friday that the two Koreas launched a joint inspection of the waters of the Hanjiang and Linjin rivers into the sea on the same day.
The initiative is a preliminary preparation to guarantee the free navigation of civilian vessels of both sides.
According to the briefing provided to the media by the Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Korea on the same day, this is the first time that the two sides have conducted a joint inspection of the entrance of the Han River to the sea since the signing of the Korean War Armistice Agreement in 1953.
The two Koreas signed a military agreement in September this year and agreed to jointly inspect the waters such as the entrance to the sea of the Han River from November, so as to ensure environmental protection and tourism development of the waters in the future.
In October, the two Koreas planned a joint inspection of the waters during the general-level meeting.
On November 5, the joint inspection of the waters of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was officially launched.
The joint investigation group was composed of 20 people, including the military and experts of the two Koreas.
According to the South Korean Defense Ministry, during the visit, the personnel of both sides did not carry weapons, and the use of words and deeds that stimulated the other side was prohibited.
"Because there is no military demarcation line near the entrance to the sea, the area was an accident-prone area, but through joint inspection, it will become a new peaceful area in the future."
The total length of the waters jointly inspected by the two Koreas is about 70 kilometers, with a total area of about 280 square kilometers.
The Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Korea said that the Republic of Korea will send six research vessels to explore the depth of sea water and so on, so as to provide basic information for the safe navigation of the waters; after the completion of the investigation, it will provide navigation maps for the movement of civilian vessels.
The two Koreas held a summit meeting in Pyongyang in October 2007 and reached an agreement on the joint use of the Hanjiang and Linjin rivers to enter the sea, but the follow-up negotiations were stalled due to the tense situation on the peninsula.
According to the military agreement signed by the two Koreas in September, the vessels of the two sides need to inform each other in advance before sailing in the common waters in the future.
On November 5, according to the website of the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia on Thursday, recently, Chinese citizens Guo Yuqin and Mao Run Xin lost their connection during their visit to Mongolia.
It is understood that the two men are members of the Blue Sky Rescue Team. On October 19, the two men contacted their relatives and friends at home and said that they would soon explore the mountains near Kusugur Lake and shared their location through micro-mail. Since then, they have lost contact and are suspected to have gone to no-man's land.
The Chinese Embassy in Mongolia has always attached great importance to the protection of the legitimate rights and security of Chinese citizens in Mongolia and to consular protection and assistance.
After learning the news of the loss of the above-mentioned two tourists, the embassy immediately launched the emergency plan for receiving insurance, striving to seize the golden rescue time and fully carry out its work.
The embassy maintained close communication with the family members of the parties concerned, assisted the family members to report the case to the Mongolian police immediately, and provided the family members with a translation list to choose from.
At the first time, the Embassy met with the heads of the Ministry of External Relations, the General Police Department and the General Emergency Department of Mongolia to inform them of the relevant situation, and requested the Mongolian side to carry out search and rescue as soon as possible, and to maintain close communication with the Mongolian side throughout the search and rescue process to ensure that the latest progress is kept up to date.
At the same time, the Embassy assisted the family members in publishing a search notice in Mongolia, and widely launched overseas Chinese and Chinese enterprises to actively participate in the search, providing effective clues and providing relevant assistance to a number of blue sky rescue team members who went to Mongolia to assist in the rescue.
Under the strong impetus of the embassy, the Mongolian side dispatched a rescue team at the first time and promised to waive the search and rescue fee.
The General Directorate of the Mongolian Police and the General Directorate of Emergency Situations instructed the police and emergency departments of Kusugur province to make every effort to search and rescue.
As the Kusugur Lake is located at the border between northern Mongolia and Russia, it is remote, sparsely populated and extremely inconvenient for transportation and communication. At present, Mongolia has entered a severe winter and the temperature is as low as minus 20 degrees. The local police and emergency departments have overcome great difficulties, mobilized almost all police forces and mobilized local herdsmen to carry out blanket search and rescue around the two people's disconnected position for a wide range of days by means of horseback riding, walking and visiting herdsmen.
At the same time, in view of the special situation of pastoral areas, the Mongolian side has been issuing search notices through the broadcast cycle for many days.
The relevant staff of the domestic blue sky rescue team have also come to Mongolia to take an active part in the rescue together with the Mongolian side.
The safety and security of the two disconnected personnel has always touched our hearts.
So far, the two men have been disconnected for more than 10 days, and the embassy has received some clues, but they have not been found. At present, the search and rescue operation is still in an intense process.
The embassy will always follow the principle of "putting people first," pay continuous attention to the matter, push the Mongolian side to continue to make every effort to search and rescue, and provide maximum assistance to the families of the parties concerned.
The Embassy calls on compatriots and enterprises in Mongolia to contact the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia at the first time if they are informed of relevant clues.
