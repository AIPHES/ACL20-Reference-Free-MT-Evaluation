According to the British media, the US Deputy Secretary of Naval Operations, Admiral William Moran, said that even if the US Navy is revitalizing its strength to deal with the increasingly worrying Russia on both sides of the Atlantic, the United States continues to expand the scope of the Asia-Pacific region to include the Indian Ocean - Asia-Pacific - as the focus of the Navy.
According to the British "Jane's Defense Weekly" website reported on September 24 that the United States listed China and Russia as strategic competitors in the new national defense strategy announced at the beginning of the year.
Since then, the US Navy has restored the Second Fleet in order to more directly confront Russian activities.
According to the report, these moves have caused some doubts and concerns among allies and analysts, who are worried that the US Navy may stay away from the "Asia-Pacific rebalancing" strategy that marks the Obama administration.
But Admiral Moran said the U.S. Navy's focus remains on the Western Pacific.
"For us, there has been no major change," he said at a round-table discussion entitled "Meeting the Challenges of the High Seas" hosted by the US National Bureau of Asian Research in Washington on January 24, 2018.
"The focus is still on rebalancing, shifting the center of gravity or whatever you want to describe it," Moran said.
However, he acknowledged that the United States has close ties with Europe.
"We will continue to focus on the growth of the West Coast and balance what we can do," he said.
While Moran pointed out that the overall policy on Russia falls within the purview of the US Defense Secretary, he warned: "The Russians may face demographic and economic challenges, but history proves that if we conflict with them, they will be very tough."
Admiral Moran said that as part of the US comeback against Russia, China and other competitors, the US Navy is dynamically deploying troops into a "new combat mode," which will help to catch opponents off guard about where the US aircraft carrier battle group or other assets will be deployed at any specific time and place.
He said: "Our Navy and Marine Corps support it - the concept of operational unpredictability, don't appear in the same place again and again, almost like a clockwork - this is our practice."
According to the report, the first to try this new approach was the "Harry Truman" aircraft carrier battle group. The early deployment of the battle group included working visits to ports and patrols in areas that usually only pass.
Moran said that the US Navy is currently working to ensure that allies know that these warships will still patrol traditional areas and are still solving logistics and family liaison problems for the new deployment procedures.
Lieutenant General Michael Noonan, commander of the Royal Australian Navy, also spoke at the event, saying that the Australian army can work seamlessly with the US aircraft carrier battle group.
He said that this situation will continue as the Royal Australian Navy plans to purchase nine more frigates equipped with Aegis combat systems.

Japan's ITOCHU Corporation recognized a $1.3 billion impairment loss on its investment in China's CITIC shares on Friday, and its largest corporate investment transaction was written down due to trade tensions between China and the United States.
In May 2016, a man walked through the headquarters of Marubeni Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan.
Maruhong said that the trade war hit Gao Hong, the US grain department, and it has suspended financial transactions in agriculture.
Some Japanese heavy equipment manufacturers and telecommunications companies have warned about the impact of Sino-US trade frictions when they announced their latest results. Now these Japanese trading companies have joined the ranks.
The United States and China have imposed tariffs on each other's hundreds of billions of dollars of goods. US President Trump has threatened to expand the scope of taxation to more than 500 billion US dollars of Chinese goods to the United States if the dispute cannot be resolved.
Tsuyoshi Hachimura, chief financial officer of ITOCHU Corporation, said that the impact of trade disputes on the Chinese economy next year may be even greater.
ITOCHU Corporation and Thai Bu Bee Group invested $10 billion in CITIC in 2015 to obtain a 20% stake.
According to Hachimura, ITOCHU Corporation has a loss of 143.3 billion yen ($1.3 billion) on this part of its shareholding, because it believes that CITIC's share price will not recover in the near future.
ITOCHU Corporation maintained its profit forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019 at 500 billion yen.
China imposed a 25% import tariff on US soybeans in July to counter Washington's measures in trade frictions.
"Our grain business has been hit by trade frictions between the United States and China," said Yanhong, Maruhong Finance Minister.
He said that Gao Hong has stopped financial transactions in his own account since September.
Gao Hong spokesman Pat Burke said in a statement on Friday that the company's move is "in accordance with internal policy restrictions and due to lack of market opportunities."
He also said that the suspension of financial transactions will not lead to a reduction in jobs.
Marubeni maintained its annual profit forecast of 230 billion yen, which was supported by pulp and paper and power generation.
Sumitomo Corporation announced on Thursday that its profit increased by 16% between April and September, emphasizing that "the trade problems between the United States and China have led to uncertain prospects."
Mitsubishi Corporation raised its annual profit forecast to a record level on Friday, due to the increase in coking coal production and the rise in commodity prices such as oil and coal.
Mitsubishi Corporation also announced a new business plan to increase its profit in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022 from the estimated 640 billion yen this year to 900 billion yen ($7.98 billion).
BEIJING, Nov. 5 Xinhua comprehensive reports, the United States midterm election voting has entered the countdown.
On November 4, President Trump and his Democratic opponents actively "urged" their core voters.
Both major parties pointed out that voter turnout will be the key to the election.
According to reports, in the 48 hours before the American people voted, Trump was busy attending the Republican candidate's rally, while former President Barack Obama went to Indiana to stand for the Democratic Federal Senate candidate Joe Donnelly, who was in a hurry, and called out the final appeal before the election.
On November 4th, Trump went to Megang, Georgia for the Republican candidate for governor Brian Kemp. He said: "You must go to the polling station on Tuesday, you must vote."
"The contrast in this election cannot be clearer."
Voters' political enthusiasm has risen to a rare peak, and early voting in some states has far exceeded the usual.
Successive US presidents face the first mid-term election, and the number of members of Congress of his party tends to decrease.
According to a new poll released by the Washington Post and ABC News on the 4th, although the Democratic Federal House of Representatives still maintains an advantage, Republicans can benefit from economic assessments and Trump's strict attention to border security.
Polls show that registered voters like Democratic House candidates more than Republicans, the proportion is 50% to 43%, but the lead is still 14 percentage points lower than in August.
Another poll conducted by NBC and the Wall Street Journal also showed that Democrats still lead Republicans by 7 percentage points.
It is reported that Obama said to the masses on the occasion of Senator Donoli's momentum: "When people don't tell the truth, when words no longer represent anything, it will inevitably have evil consequences.
When people can only lie to themselves, democracy cannot work. "
"The only way to stop these Republicans now is for you and your vote."
The Democratic Party faces the most difficult election in the Senate in decades, and the Republican Party currently holds more than half of the 51 seats.
But the House election is more favorable. The Democratic Party needs to win 23 more seats to control the 435-seat House of Representatives.
Analysts at FiveThirtyEight.com, a campaign website, estimate that Democrats are as likely to win the House of Representatives as 85%.
The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference held an important ideological and theoretical seminar of General Secretary Xi Jinping on strengthening and improving the work of the CPPCC. Wang Yang attended and spoke.
The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference held an important ideological and theoretical seminar on strengthening and improving the work of the CPPCC in Beijing from the 29th to the 30th.
Wang Yang, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, attended the meeting and spoke.
He stressed that General Secretary Xi Jinping's important thinking on strengthening and improving the work of the CPPCC has profoundly clarified the status role, target tasks, duties and missions of the CPPCC, and practical requirements. He has scientifically answered a series of important questions of direction, overall and strategic, and is a powerful ideological weapon to guide the work of the CPPCC in the new era.
We must earnestly study and implement this important thought, grasp its great significance, rich connotation and spiritual essence, earnestly work hard to learn and understand, promote the quality of CPPCC work with theoretical study and ideological armed forces, and earnestly shoulder the new mission of the CPPCC in the new era.
From September 29 to 30, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference held an important ideological and theoretical seminar on strengthening and improving the work of the CPPCC in Beijing.
Wang Yang pointed out that since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), General Secretary Xi Jinping has put forward a series of new ideas and new arguments on strengthening and improving the work of the CPPCC. For the first time, the CPPCC is an important channel for socialist consultation and democracy and a special consultative body. It is an important part of the national governance system. It is an institutional arrangement with Chinese characteristics. For the first time, it clarifies the characteristics and advantages of the new political party system, emphasizes the correct handling of consistency and diversity, and reveals the true meaning of the CPPCC, and reveals the theory of the theory of the CPPCC.
Wang Yang stressed that CPPCC committees at all levels should take theoretical study and discussion as an opportunity to further find the weak links and shortcomings of CPPCC work, and work hard to strengthen and improve.
It is necessary to comprehensively strengthen the party building of the CPPCC system and ensure that the decision-making and deployment of the CPC Central Committee are fully implemented in the work of the CPPCC.
It is necessary to strengthen ideological and political guidance, improve the system, procedures and mechanisms of "two-way power" for advice management and consensus building, and implement ideological and political guidance to all aspects and the whole process of performing duties.
It is necessary to focus on the central task of performing duties and responsibilities, better obey the overall situation of serving the party and the state, improve the quality of advice and administration, and enhance the effectiveness of performing duties.
It is necessary to strengthen the self-construction of the CPPCC, do a good job in the education and training of members and cadres, give full play to the basic role of the special committee, and consolidate the foundation for the CPPCC to perform its duties.
It is necessary to strengthen the guidance of the work of the local CPPCC, and improve the overall level of the work of the CPPCC by guiding the direction, demonstrating and solving difficult problems.
In order to thoroughly study and implement Xi Jinping's new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics and the spirit of the 19th Party Congress, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference system began to carry out General Secretary Xi Jinping's important ideological study and discussion activities on strengthening and improving the work of the People's Political Consultative Conference in May, held 8 district symposiums and 7 experts and scholars, and identified 18 key topics and 6 basic theoretical topics. A total of 793.8 million CPPCC members and 279,000 government cadres at all levels participated in the study and research papers.
People's Daily Online, Beijing, November 5th (Wang Xiaoyan) Under the current wave of "mass entrepreneurship, mass innovation," more and more technology companies began to attach importance to patent research and development and related protection work, digging deep into the potential value of patents, and occupying market leadership.
Similarly, there are many scientific and technological enterprises in the patent technology authorization, patent technology use and so on have encountered no small infringement storm.
At the end of 2017, Tan Wei, He Zhanghong and Lai Bin from Guangdong Province, on the grounds of patent infringement, brought the developer of the "drip travel" APP, Beijing Xiaotong Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Xiaotong Technology), the operator Didi Travel Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Didi Travel), and the seller Guangdong Pacific Internet Information Service Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Guangdong Pacific) to the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The three plaintiffs requested the court to order that the three defendants immediately stop manufacturing, selling, promising to sell, and using the plaintiff's patent behavior.
On October 30, 2018, the China Referee Documents Network published the "Tan Wei, He Zhanghong and Beijing Xiaotong Technology Co., Ltd. and other civil rulings on the infringement of invention patents," revealing some details of the cases in which the drip travel APP was sued for patent infringement.
The third plaintiff believes that the patentee and inventor of the patent "based on the mobile terminal carpool service system and method," and the entire operation process of the "downwind" application in the "drip travel" APP corresponds to the technical scheme of the patent protection involved, which constitutes a patent infringement.
However, during the court's ruling, Xiaotong Technology believes that Guangdong Pacific is not a suitable defendant. It only provides free downloads of the APP "drip travel" on the Internet, and does not implement the patent method involved. There is no direct or indirect infringement, and it should not be listed as a defendant in this case.
Secondly, the infringement in this case is not in Guangdong.
According to the law, the infringement of the patent involved should be the place where the patent method involved was completely implemented. Therefore, the court's jurisdiction was challenged and the case was transferred to the court where the defendant lived, namely the Beijing Intellectual Property Court.
The Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court held that the defendant, Guangdong Pacific, provided the alleged infringing drip travel APP products on its network platform. It is not inappropriate for the plaintiff to list the defendant Guangdong Pacific as a defendant.
And the defendant Guangdong Pacific's residence is in Guangzhou, which is within the jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The defendant Xiaotong Science and Technology advocated that the case should be transferred to the Beijing Intellectual Property Court for trial. The basis is insufficient, and the defendant Xiaotong Technology Co., Ltd. rejected the objection to the jurisdiction of the case, and assumed the jurisdiction objection case acceptance costs.
At present, other trials of the case have not been announced, and the reporter will also pay close attention to the follow-up details of the drip travel patent infringement case.
Interview with the CEO of the Australian Federal Science and Industrial Research Organization: Australia-China scientific and technological cooperation has achieved remarkable results
"China's science and technology have developed rapidly in the past few decades. Australia and China can achieve fruitful results in the field of science."
Larry Marshall, chief executive of the Australian Federal Science and Industrial Research Organization, said in an exclusive interview with the China News Agency in Beijing that from the fight against climate change to the "Sky Eye" project cooperation, Australia-China cooperation in the field of science and technology has shown great vitality.
As the largest national scientific research institution in the Australian Federation, CSIRO has achieved many innovative research results in the fields of ocean, energy, biology, materials, astronomy, etc.
CSIRO has maintained close cooperation with scientific research institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
"This is a lasting friendship. This friendship contains a tradition of trust in partners and long-term cooperation." Marshall said.
In May this year, China's 500-meter spherical radio telescope, the "China Sky Eye," installed the first 19-beam L-band receiver in the world.
This is currently the most advanced 19-beam feed receiver in the world, which was jointly developed by Chinese and Australian scientists.
Marshall said that the successful development of the receiver is based on the technical accumulation of CSIRO for many years. After the opening, the FAST patrol speed will be increased by 5 to 6 times, and more scientific observation targets will be expanded.
"This is a contribution of CSIRO to FAST."
In addition to the above cooperation, CSIRO also has close cooperation with Chinese scientific research institutions in the construction of square-kilometer array radio telescopes, research and development of new fuel technologies, energy conservation and emission reduction.
"In the past, scientific research often focused on the problems of hundreds of years later, and more scientific research forces are needed to solve the problems in front of them."
Marshall believes that Australia and China are complementary in the field of scientific development, and both countries are facing a series of challenges in their development.
For example, extreme weather occurs frequently in the world, droughts and floods have led to reduced food production, and food shortages have seriously affected human development.
At the same time, problems such as population explosion, aging, and chronic diseases are also serious challenges.
"The cooperation between Australia and China in recent years is mainly aimed at solving these current problems."
Marshall said that the International Southern Hemisphere Marine Research Center, jointly built by CSIRO and Qingdao National Laboratory of Marine Science and Technology, focuses on observing the El Niño phenomenon and La Niña phenomenon, studying the relationship between the two and extreme weather, and establishing early warning facilities for extreme weather. The new grain varieties jointly developed by CSIRO and the Chinese Academy of Sciences can also alleviate the food shortage caused by extreme weather.
"In the current environment, scientific and technological innovation is difficult to complete alone, requires extremely high costs, and there are many problems to be solved, so cooperation is particularly important today."
Marshall said that the closer the cooperation, the more likely it is to make breakthroughs. This is also the significance of strengthening cooperation between Australia and China under the "One Belt, One Road" framework.
"Strengthening bilateral cooperation is mainly scientific and technological cooperation for us."
Marshall said, for example, that CSIRO has recently developed a gold purification method that does not use cyanide. Because the traditional cyanide gold purification method is very harmful to the environment, many countries hope to find a gold purification method with small environmental pollution.
"We are very willing to introduce this technology to China, which is one of the results of our participation in the" One Belt, One Road "cooperation."

North Korean Foreign Minister Li Yonghao told the United Nations on Saturday that continuing to impose sanctions is deepening North Korea's distrust of the United States. North Korea cannot unilaterally abandon nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Li Yonghao said at the UN General Assembly that North Korea has adopted a "very friendly approach" in the past year, including stopping missile and nuclear tests, dismantling nuclear test sites, and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we have not seen any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"If we don't trust the United States, we have no confidence in our national security. Under such circumstances, we cannot unilaterally give up weapons first."
Although Li Yonghao repeated North Korea's complaint that the United States opposes "phased" denuclearization, his speech is of great significance because it does not completely reject unilateral denuclearization as North Korea did before.
Li Yonghao mentioned the joint statement of Kim Jong-un and Trump on June 12, when Kim Jong-un agreed to work toward "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula," and Trump promised to protect North Korea's security.
North Korea has been seeking to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said that North Korea must first give up nuclear weapons.
The United States has also refused to relax its demands for international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on" denuclearization first "and increases the pressure of sanctions to achieve the goal in a high-pressure manner, and even refuses to issue a" declaration on the end of the war, "Li Yonghao said.
"The idea that sanctions can make us beg for mercy is that people who don't understand us are daydreaming.
But the problem is that this kind of continuous sanctions is deepening our distrust. "
Li Yonghao did not mention the second special gold meeting plan mentioned by the US president at the United Nations earlier this week.
On the contrary, he stressed the three meetings between Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-yin in the past five months, and said: "If the other side of denuclearization is South Korea rather than North Korea, then the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula will not become so deadlocked."
China announced that it will reduce import tariffs for 1,585 tax items from November 1, 2018.
Since the beginning of this year, China has taken the initiative to reduce import tariffs.
On May 1 this year, the drug comprehensively reduced the tax, and all ordinary drugs including anti-cancer drugs and alkaloid drugs with anti-cancer effects, and imported proprietary Chinese medicines, etc., were adjusted to zero.
At the same time, it has also greatly reduced the value-added tax burden on the production and import of anti-cancer drugs.
July 1 on 218 tax purposes of cars and parts tax reduction.
After the tax reduction, China's automobile vehicle tax rate has been lower than the average level of developing countries, which is in line with the actual situation of China's automobile industry.
This tax reduction will promote industry restructuring and resource optimization, accelerate the survival of the fittest, help to improve the quality of products and services, and is expected to promote car price adjustment to a certain extent, so that consumers can get more benefits.
July 1 to 1449 tax purposes for daily consumer goods tax reduction.
The reduction of taxes on consumer goods is closely related to the people's needs for a better life.
The tax reduction is not only large in number but also strong, with an average tax reduction of 56%.
Daily consumer goods tax reduction, directly benefit the majority of consumers, and promote domestic industries to improve competitiveness.
On November 1st, 1585 industrial products such as mechanical and electrical equipment, spare parts and raw materials for tax purposes will be reduced.
Proper reduction of import tariffs on some domestic urgently needed industrial products can attract more foreign investment, which is conducive to increasing effective domestic supply and helping industrial upgrading. At the same time, it helps enterprises to allocate resources on a global scale and reduce production costs. It is also conducive to reducing the pressure on the domestic environment.
The relevant person in charge of the Customs Tariff Commission Office of the State Council of China introduced that the above four independent tax reductions, as well as the third step tax reduction implemented on July 1 this year in accordance with the information technology agreement to expand the scope of negotiations, will reduce China's total tariff level from 9.8% in the previous year to 7.5%.
The adjusted total tariff level is slightly higher than that of the EU, lower than that of most developing countries, at a moderately low level, and basically matches the status and development stage of China's developing countries.
The person in charge introduced that the overall level of tariffs, as one of the important indicators of China's openness in the field of goods trade, should be compatible with the stage of China's economic development and reflect the characteristics of the times.
The scale of China's trade in goods is the first in the world, and it already has the economic base to further expand opening up. However, the quality and efficiency of trade development are still different from that of developed economies. Therefore, the overall tariff level should be appropriately reduced.
Tariff is a means of protection for compliance. The tariff level should be compatible with industrial competitiveness. It is necessary to encourage healthy competition. Excessive protection is not conducive to industrial development and quality improvement.
The adjustment of tariff rate should take into account production needs and consumption needs.
We will focus on reducing the commodity tax rate that is large in domestic demand and conducive to industrial transformation and upgrading, strive to increase the import of characteristic superior products with concentrated needs of the people, continuously enhance the sense of access of enterprises and the public, and meet the needs of upgrading the industrial structure and consumption structure.
The intensity of tax reduction should take into account the affordability of fiscal revenue and industrial development.
In the choice of specific tax reduction commodities and tax reduction ranges, it is necessary to coordinate and coordinate the two domestic and foreign markets, upstream and downstream aspects, production and consumption, and maintain the development momentum of China's economic stability.
The person in charge stressed that this year is the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up. China's initiative to reduce the overall level of import tariffs is a major measure based on China's own needs to achieve high-quality development. It is conducive to the overall use of international and foreign resources, promoting the quality of the domestic supply system, and meeting the needs of the people's consumption.
This action and initiative show that China will unswervingly pursue a mutually beneficial and win-win strategy of opening up, firmly support economic globalization, resolutely safeguard the principle of free trade and the multilateral trading system with the WTO as the core, and continue to draw development momentum from opening up to the world, so that China's development will better benefit the world.
Serbia announced that it has entered the highest state of readiness. The Russian President will meet tomorrow to discuss the situation in Kosovo.
The Nantong News Agency quoted the Serbian President's Office as saying that in view of the Kosovo special forces occupying the passage of the water storage lake of the Gazivoda Hydropower Station controlled by Belgrade in northern Kosovo, Serbian President Vucic ordered the country's armed forces to enter the highest state of readiness.
On September 29, Serbian Defense Minister Wulin declared that the Serbian army has entered a state of full readiness.
Wulin stressed that as long as the order issued by Vucic is still valid, Serbia will continue to maintain monitoring of the current situation in Kosovo. No matter which direction the situation develops, the Serbian army will respond.
According to the Russian news agency Tass, on September 29, Vucic said in an interview that he has informed the current situation with the United States, Russia and Europe, and will go to Moscow on October 2 to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin and seek Putin's support on the Kosovo issue.
When asked if Serbia needs Russian military support like Syria, Vucic gave a negative answer: "I don't want a major military conflict on our territory."
Vucic also said that the Serbian army entered a comprehensive state of readiness only to form a deterrent to prevent the occurrence of conflict, but this is also a clear warning: it will never tolerate any violence in Kosovo.
The reason why the Serbian army has upgraded its combat readiness is related to the two major moves of the Kosovo side.
According to the Serbian side, in recent days, Albanians have been arresting Serbs who have lived in the northern part of Kosovo for generations, and these arrested Serbs have not violated any laws.
Vucic said that since March 26 this year, the head of the Kosovo and Metohija Office of the Serbian government, Mako Juric, was beaten and detained by the Kosovo Albanian army, the ethnic Albanians have continuously escalated the situation in the region and arrested and expelled the Serbs without humanity.
In addition, more than 100 people, including ROSU special forces, armed police and snipers of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Kosovo, who announced their establishment, occupied positions near the water storage lake of the Gazivoda Hydropower Station, entered the ecological and sports center near the dam in the northern part of Kosovo, and blocked all nearby roads. These areas were originally controlled by the Serbian side.
Vucic pointed out that this military adventure in Kosovo was made at the instigation of Western countries. The actions of the Kosovo army did not inform the Serbian side in advance, in violation of chapter 9, paragraph 1, of the Brussels Agreement, and also violated the UN Security Council Resolution 1244 and the military technical agreement between Seko.
Vucic has already shouted to NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg, criticizing the hypocritical rhetoric of Western countries on the Kosovo issue.
The root cause of the current conflict is still the historical enmity between the two communities in Kosovo for hundreds of years.
With regard to the ownership of Kosovo, the Serbs and Albanians have their own opinions.
Serbia regards Kosovo as the birthplace of the nation and the cradle of culture, because Serbia established its strongest country here in the 12th century, and the Albanians only moved in after the Ottoman Empire invaded and the Serbian army retreated to the north.
The Albanians insist that the original tribe that lived in Kosovo in the 4th and 5th centuries B.C., the Illyrians, are the ancestors of the Albanians. Therefore, Kosovo has been an Albanian territory since ancient times.
Subjective political division has caused fierce conflicts among different nationalities, religions and cultures, resulting in fierce confrontation between Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo.
In 1912, Kosovo Albanians first declared the independence of Albania.
After the First World War, a large number of ethnic Albanians living in the Balkans moved to Turkey, and the proportion of Serbs increased relatively. In the eyes of the Serbs, the practice of "just taking back their own land" was regarded by the Albanians as the "Great Serbian" plunder, and the contradictions between the two communities intensified.
Kosovo became the "powder keg" of the Balkans.
In 1999, the Albanian separatists in the Kosovo Liberation Army had an armed conflict with the Serbian army and police, which led to the NATO army bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia formed by Serbia and Montenegro, and the war in Kosovo broke out.
On 17 February 2008, Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia.
Since then, although it has been reported that Serbia will normalize relations with Kosovo and sign a global and legally binding agreement, due to historical ethnic grievances and geopolitical constraints, the agreement that is subject to the US, Europe and Russia has not been signed.
Just a month ago, Vucic made it clear for the first time that he advocated the separation of Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo, and once again opened the contradiction between the two communities.
Power communications still interrupted Indonesia's strong earthquake and tsunami rescue difficulties
According to the figures released by the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency in the early morning of the 30th, the strong earthquake and tsunami that occurred in Donggara County, Central Sulawesi Province on the 28th have caused 420 deaths.
Wilem Rampangilei, head of the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, said the figure was only preliminary statistics from Palu City, the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, about 80 kilometers from the epicentre of the earthquake. Because of the lack of large-scale search and rescue machinery, many hotels, shopping malls, warehouses and other crowded buildings damaged by the earthquake have not yet been searched.
A bridge damaged by the earthquake and tsunami collapsed and broke into several sections on Ba Road, Indonesia, September 29, 2018.
Due to the serious damage to electricity and communication facilities, the epicentre of Donggara County and the adjacent Xiji area are still "isolated islands" that cannot be contacted, and it is impossible to count the number of victims.
According to media reports here, Indonesian Vice President Kara said that the death toll may reach thousands.
Power interruption, communication interruption, road blocking, airport damage... The rescue work after the strong earthquake and tsunami is difficult.
Due to power outages, some hospitals and rescue settlements in Palu City need to rely on fuel to generate electricity.
And roads in and out of the city were blocked by landslides, and large transport vehicles, including oil tankers, could not enter, making fuel supply very tight.
Indonesian Social Minister Agus said that due to road damage, the Ministry's tents, mattresses, blankets, clothes, food, household supplies and other emergency relief materials from the neighboring provinces of South Sulawesi and Goluntalo have not yet arrived in the disaster area.
Disaster relief materials transferred from the capital Jakarta are being transported to the disaster area through air force transport aircraft.
In view of the damage to the command tower and runway of Palu Airport in the earthquake, in order to ensure safety and ensure rescue, all commercial flights have been suspended, only for military aircraft carrying relief materials and personnel to take off and land.
Indonesian Political, Legal and Security Affairs Coordinating Minister Wiranto, who directed the rescue in the earthquake area, called for the restoration of power supply and airport commercial flight services as soon as possible to ensure the operation of hospitals and other rescue agencies, so that more rescue workers and volunteers and aid materials can arrive in the disaster area.
On the 28th, a number of strong earthquakes occurred in Donggara County, Central Sulawesi Province, Indonesia. Among them, a 7.7-magnitude earthquake occurred at 17: 02 local time, causing a tsunami, causing a major disaster in Palu City, Donggara County and Xiji.
Beijing, 1 Oct (ZXS) -- Recently, Beijing continued to open the most beautiful blue sky mode, attracting thousands of people in the capital to show their happiness on the social platform, saying that "under the blue sky and white clouds, the 'drunk' skyline is the best business card in Beijing."
Since August, Beijing has ushered in the "bluest sky."
Within the capital, people can be seen anytime, anywhere or with smartphones, or holding SLR cameras to take pictures.
Weibo, WeChat circle of friends and other social platforms, can be seen everywhere in the netizen lens of the Forbidden City, Tiananmen Square, Bird's Nest, Hutong... All kinds of buildings show different beauty against the blue sky.
Some netizens said that such a "scenic blockbuster" is the best city propaganda film in Beijing; some netizens joked that if such a blue sky is long-term, people with cervical spondylosis can be cured; more netizens hope that "this wiping blue can be overwintering in the spring and summer, so that the four seasons of the capital are blue."
Why do people in the capital particularly love to bask in the blue sky?
Only because the people who lived in this city in the past suffered from smog and haze, they are particularly eager for the blue sky. After the "blue sky defense battle" was launched in Beijing, the air quality continued to improve, the smog became less and the blue sky increased. The people are happy in the heart, and the happiness obtained is also particularly important.
On the National Day, the weather in Beijing is fine.
At 8 o'clock in the morning, the vast majority of the 35 air quality monitoring stations in the city showed "excellent" green.
The "Blue Sky" theme photography contest initiated by the people on the social platform is still continuing.
Why is the sky so blue in Beijing recently?
According to the relevant person in charge of the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau, in August this year, the average concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in Beijing was 35 ug / m3, setting the best record in the same period in the past five years.
In September, the real-time concentration of PM2.5 was even more frequent in single digits.
A major factor in the emergence of the "bluest sky" is that the weather conditions in recent times are generally favorable. More importantly, Beijing has continuously carried out air pollution control. In the past five years, it has vigorously promoted the clean air action plan, and the environmental benefits have continued to be released. The total amount of pollutants in the region has been reduced, which has laid the foundation for continuous improvement of air quality.
Beijing officially released and implemented the "Beijing Clean Air Action Plan 2013-2017" in 2013.
According to the plan, officials continue to guide non-capital functions, promote energy clean substitution and pollution reduction, and eliminate 4,923 coal-fired boilers.
Beijing has thus become the first major city in mainland China to realize the natural gas of the whole network.
According to the data, between 2013 and 2017, the average annual concentration of PM2.5 in Beijing decreased by 35.6%; the number of days of air quality compliance increased by 50 days; the number of days of first-class excellent increased by 25 days; the number of days of heavy pollution decreased by 35 days, and the incidence of heavy pollution decreased significantly.
While the air quality continues to improve, Beijing officials released the "Three-Year Action Plan for Beijing to Win the Blue Sky Defense Battle" in September this year, focusing on the key prevention and control areas such as diesel trucks, dust, and volatile organic compounds, optimizing and adjusting the transportation structure, industrial structure, energy structure and land structure, strengthening the regional joint control, and striving to strengthen the city's green development.
During the Golden Week of the National Day this year, the relevant departments of the Municipal Tourism Commission, industry and commerce, urban management, and public security will strengthen the law enforcement inspection of the "one-day tour" market, focusing on the "six black" chaos of tourism. Once verified, the illegal violators will be given strict and strict punishment according to law.
Yesterday morning, the municipal government held a special meeting to crack down on illegal "day trips" and deployed special operations to further crack down on illegal "day trips."
At the meeting, it was revealed that focusing on the "six black" chaos of black ticket mention, black guide, black society, black car, black shop and black network interest chain, the city launched a special campaign to crack down on illegal "one-day tour" on July 28.
Since the launch of the special operation, the city has accepted a total of 39 "day trip" complaints, down 63% year on year; this year, the city has accepted 270 "day trip" complaints, down 62% year on year.
In the past two months, the city has seized 248 "black cars," investigated and dealt with 158 violations of tourist passenger transport business, closed 29 shopping "black shops" and entertainment venues, investigated and dealt with 13 "black clubs" and 27 "black guides," confiscated 26,000 illegal advertisements, dismantled 31 illegal "one-day tour" billboards, and investigated and dealt with all kinds of illegal activities.
After rectification, the illegal "one-day tour" chaos has been basically curbed, and the "one-day tour" market order has shown a stable and good situation.
According to reports, in recent years, the city has continuously increased the rectification of illegal "day trips."
In 2016 and 2017, the Municipal Tourism Commission accepted 1612 and 897 complaints of "one-day tour," which decreased by 79% and 44% respectively year-on-year, but illegal "one-day tour" still repeatedly hit and often rebounded, and formed a black ticket, black guide, black society, black car, black shop, black net and other interest chains intertwined "six black" chaos.
Specifically, the street illegal passengers are "black ticket mention," the illegal website that publishes false travel information is "black network," the travel agency that engages in illegal "day trip" or the organization or individual that does not have travel agency business qualifications is "black society," "black society" The tour guide that is employed without a tour guide or illegal practice is "black guide," and the vehicles that are used without travel passenger transport qualifications are "black shops."
In this special operation, the city has continuously increased the fixed inspection and mobile inspection of illegal "one-day tour." In view of the frequent occurrence of illegal "one-day tour" and the impact of large tourist routes, the relevant departments have dispatched unannounced visits to the group every day. After discovering illegal and illegal evidence, it is strictly investigated and dealt with according to law.
Among them, "black car" and "black shop" have become the focus of two special operations.
According to the report, without black cars, illegal "day trips" cannot be made. Black cars are easy to be discovered, remembered and investigated, and are also fixed assets with high individual value.
Relevant departments use road traffic monitoring probes to increase the supervision of key "one-day tour" tour buses, and use technical defense, material defense and other scientific and technological intelligent means to detect and investigate "black cars" in a timely manner.
Travel shopping "black shop" due to the small number, sitting on the ground, has also become the focus of severe fighting.
In order to strengthen the deterrent and crackdown on illegal "day trips," all functional departments will be given strict and strict punishment according to law.
In August this year, the city also held a seminar on legal issues related to the illegal "one-day tour," and discussed the means of combining administrative punishment with conviction.
The Municipal Tourism Commission said that in the future, more regular travel agencies will be encouraged to carry out "one-day tours" in Beijing and increase the supply of regular "one-day tours" to further occupy the living space of illegal "one-day tours." At present, specific programs are still under study.
In addition, the Municipal Tourism Commission has continuously improved the tour group electronic itinerary information system to ensure that each team is included in the electronic itinerary platform supervision.
From a tourist symbol to a digital economic symbol, what Wuzhen has experienced in these years
As the permanent venue of the World Internet Conference, how to undertake the summit dividend in Wuzhen has attracted much attention.
From the beginning of the first World Internet Conference, in the past five years, the changes in Wuzhen are obvious to all.
In 2014, there were only 12 companies related to the digital economy and the Internet in the town. By the third quarter of this year, there were more than 500 companies.
This is a microcosm of the development of digital economy in Wuzhen.
The convening of the Internet Conference has enabled local enterprises to accept the enlightenment of the digital economy and digital wave at a distance. The desire for enterprise transformation and upgrading is very strong. Traditional manufacturing enterprises have increased investment and research and development in machine replacement and intelligent management.
Jiang Wei, secretary of the party committee of Wuzhen Town, said that Wuzhen will build a new economic empowerment center in the future.
The development of digital economy cannot be separated from the support of infrastructure.
This year, Wuzhen launched the 5G pilot work on the basis of achieving full coverage of 4G communication network and free WiFi.
At the same time, Tongxiang City, where Wuzhen is located, as the first county-level city in the country to build a special channel for international Internet data, has also become a hot spot for the development of the Internet industry.
Since the first World Internet Conference, Tongxiang has introduced 565 digital economy projects, with a total planned investment of 37.725 billion yuan. In the first three quarters of this year, the core manufacturing industry of the digital economy achieved a total output value of 8.73 billion yuan, and the added value increased by 13% year-on-year.
"Wuzhen was a tourist symbol before, and later there were more drama and cultural symbols. Because of the Internet conference, it has now become a symbol of the Internet and digital economy."
Sheng Yongjun, secretary of the Tongxiang Municipal Party Committee, believes that the dividends of the World Internet Conference have accumulated over time. Therefore, it is also necessary to build a platform to undertake the superposition of talents, projects, technologies and other elements.
Tongxiang people Shen Yi worked outside for 20 years, because of the connection with the Internet conference, returning home to start a business.
On December 2 last year, he took a high-capacity anti-tampering digital technology solution and entered the 4th Internet Light Expo, which was favored by many customers.
Shen Yi chose to start a business in Wuzhen not only because of his hometown complex. "In Wuzhen, it is easier to recruit people than I thought. Our application also landed quickly. Wuzhen smart parking project has our application."
A Wuzhen Avenue presents the spillover effect of the Internet conference.
This road through the north and south of Tongxiang, not only strung up tourist attractions, but also an industrial road.
Relying on it, Wuzhen Avenue Kechuang agglomeration area came into being.
The reporter learned that in the future, Wuzhen Avenue will become the main position of Tongxiang's industrial development, taking the lead in applying a large number of achievements such as smart medical care, smart pension, and smart government affairs, and gathering industries that account for 80% of the city's GDP and many high-level talents.
Tsunami caused by strong earthquake in Indonesia has killed at least 410 people
According to the Indonesian Jakarta Police Public Information Bureau said on the evening of the 29th that the earthquake in Central Sulawesi Province has killed 410 people, and 97 of them have been identified.
Another 29 people are missing and 540 people are injured.
Palu Airport is still closed.
Active treatment, the survival rate of premature infants aged 29 weeks and above in China reached 98%, which has reached the level of developed countries.
SHANGHAI, September 30 (Chen Jing Luo Yanqian) National Children's Medical Center and Fudan University Affiliated Pediatric Hospital disclosed on the 30th that it introduced Canada's advanced methods in the leading "China NICU Inpatient Premature Infant Prognosis Quality Improvement Project."
The results of the project show that after active treatment, the survival rate of premature infants aged 29 weeks and above in China has reached 98%, which has reached the level of developed countries, but there is still much room for improvement in the survival rate of premature infants and premature infants of very small gestational age.
In the past 20 years, the Chinese government has been paying attention to the treatment of newborns.
At present, the infant mortality rate in Shanghai has dropped to 3.71 per thousand, which is significantly lower than the national average and reached the advanced level of developed countries.
"China NICU Hospitalized Premature Infants Prognosis Quality Improvement Project" has greatly improved the quality of life of preterm infants through four years of unremitting efforts.
Professor Cao Yun, director of the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of the Affiliated Pediatric Hospital of Fudan University, told reporters that while improving the survival rate of premature infants, paying attention to reducing the survival quality of premature infants, reducing the incidence of complications, improving the prognosis of neurodevelopment, and improving the overall outcome of children are of great significance to improving the overall quality of life and population quality of premature infants. It is an important issue for the pediatric and neonatal departments at home and abroad. It is also a key issue of concern for this project.
"China NICU Hospitalized Premature Infants Prognosis Quality Improvement Project" through four years of unremitting efforts, including tens of thousands of premature infants with a gestational age of 33 weeks and below, resulting in a 1 / 3 drop in the mortality rate of small fetal age and small birth weight premature infants in China. At the same time, the incidence of serious complications in premature infants has dropped significantly, greatly improving the quality of life of premature infants.
The project through the establishment of a national newborn quality improvement cooperation network, the introduction of collaborative quality improvement concepts, radiating 25 collaborative hospitals throughout China, and establishing a set of cooperative methods suitable for domestic conditions to improve the prognosis of premature infants and improve the level of neonatal treatment.
Fudan University Affiliated Pediatric Hospital is working with the national neonatal department to develop guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections according to the accumulated experience of the project, so as to provide reference and guidance for the standard diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections in China.
It is understood that in the "China Premature Baby Prognosis Quality Improvement Project," the pediatric hospital introduced the EPIQ method to 25 large NICUs in 19 provinces in China, and is committed to solving the problem of premature infant infection that is plaguing China's neonatal care unit.
After more than 10 years of continuous improvement, the survival rate of premature infants in Canada has increased by about 1 / 3. Canada is now one of the countries with the best prognosis of premature infants in the world.
EPIQ method has been applied to all NICUs in Canada and has been adopted by 6 countries.
Pediatric hospitals revealed that the results showed that after two years of EPIQ intervention, the infection of premature infants decreased by 35%, while the use of antibiotics decreased by 20%.
In the future, Fudan University Affiliated Pediatric Hospital will continue to promote and implement this method nationwide, with a view to comprehensively reducing the incidence of all complications of premature infants and improving the quality of treatment of newborns nationwide.
At present, it is an indisputable fact that there are differences and inequalities in the level of treatment in various regions of China.
According to Professor Cao Yun, as an important construction unit of the National Children's Medical Center, the pediatric hospital will play a leading role in radiation. This research covers many western provinces such as Xinjiang, Guizhou, Gansu and Shaanxi, with a view to gradually promoting the homogeneity and standardization of neonatal treatment nationwide.
It is understood that the Pediatric Hospital affiliated to Fudan University is working with the national neonatal department to formulate guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections according to the accumulated experience of the project, so as to provide reference and guidance for the standard diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections in China.
According to reports, in 2019, the coordination center is located in the China Neonatal Cooperation Network of the Affiliated Pediatric Hospital of Fudan University. It will unite 63 hospitals across the country to carry out the next phase of national quality improvement, with a view to promoting the development of the level of neonatal treatment in China.
The director of the Shanghai Health and Family Planning Commission said that Shanghai can become a central city in Asia, not only in research, but also in the construction of the entire service system. The service quality and service results should have a place in Asia, thus truly reflecting China's medical level.
Xin Liping: Build the "hero monument" in the heart - written on the fifth martyr's anniversary.
On September 30, on the eve of the 69th birthday of the Republic, we ushered in the fifth anniversary of the martyrs. Xi Jinping and other party and state leaders came to Tiananmen Square to attend the flower basket ceremony for the people's heroes.
At this moment, no matter where you are, please pay tribute to Yinglie.
Memorial Day, is to relive, but also wake up.
Open the thick history, behind the name of every martyr, it is a living life.
They also have hot youth, sincere love, and family members who are concerned.
However, because they firmly believe that "the doctrine of our faith is the truth of the universe," they are willing to sacrifice everything in order to "forgive the suffering of the next generation."
"I will shout for China one day to survive."
Through time and space, the heroes set up a spiritual road sign to guide the direction of moving forward.
"Where to come from, where to go" "What kind of person to be," read Yinglie, it is not difficult to get the answer.
To commemorate Yinglie, the most important thing is to build a "hero monument" in the heart.
According to incomplete statistics, since the revolutionary war years, about 20 million martyrs have devoted themselves to national independence, people's liberation, and national prosperity and strength.
For various reasons, many martyrs did not even leave their names.
Countless Yinglie water the ideal with blood, practice faith with life, remember their British name, inherit their spirit, is to protect the roots and soul of the nation.
This "hero monument" does not allow any defacing and destruction.
For some time, the undercurrent of historical nihilism and pan-entertainment has surged.
All kinds of practices that distort history and derogate from heroic, challenge the conscience of justice, and misjudge the value, causing public anger and vigilance of the whole society.
Yinglie does not allow desecration, and the hero cannot forget.
The act of touching the bottom line cannot be left unattended. We must dare to shine the sword and defend the heroic dignity with the rule of law and justice.
On May 1 this year, the Hero Martyrs Protection Law was officially implemented.
From the point of view of judicial practice, the judgments of some cases are very gratifying, not only effectively maintaining the glorious image of Yinglie according to law, but also releasing the positive energy of advocating heroes and admiring martyrs.
A pursuing nation cannot be without heroes, and a country with ideals cannot be without pioneers.
Remembering the martyrs and calling for heroes has become a universal social consensus.
At present, there are millions of memorial facilities in the country, and more than 100 million people visit the Martyrs Cemetery every year.
The heart is the strongest cornerstone.
Let advocate the hero, defend the hero, learn the hero, care for the hero, let the heroic spirit into the national blood, a "hero monument" will stand between heaven and earth, the depths of the heart.
BRUSSELS, September 28 (Reuters) - After Italy flouted the EU's demands and surprised the market with a large-scale budget deficit plan, the EU took a non-confrontational stance against Italy on Friday, but if Italy insists on too bold goals, the EU may adopt a more radical stance.
Italy's suspected European government aims to run a budget deficit equivalent to 2.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) over the next three years, indicating that there is no debt reduction in the face of deficit reduction requirements.
"We have no interest in the crisis between the Executive Committee and Italy," said Moskevisi, the EU's executive committee on economic affairs, on Friday. "Since the EU's proposals and sanctions may have little impact on Italy, he took a cautious response.
EU officials and diplomats still hope that market forces will persuade Italy to adjust its budget plan before Italy is officially submitted to the EU Executive Committee in mid-October.
After the government announced its plan, the euro fell to its lowest level in nearly two weeks on Friday, while Italian bond yields hit their highest level in three weeks.
If the deficit target remains unchanged before the October deadline, the EU Executive Committee may veto Italy's draft budget, which is something that the Executive Committee has never done to any country.
Dong Brovsky, vice chairman of the EU Executive Committee, said at a meeting in the Latvian capital Riga on Friday that Italy's current fiscal plan "seems to be inconsistent with the stability and growth pact," referring to the EU's fiscal regulations.
But he did not say how this would trigger the EU's response.
Bidders can submit applications to participate in the public bidding before October 26 this year.
Previously, the Russian Ministry of Agriculture made China one of the priority markets for Russian agricultural exports.
The Russian Agricultural Supervision Bureau announced in May that Russia's grain exports to China exceeded 1 million tons for the first time in this agricultural year, a record.
The bureau predicts that China may enter the top ten Russian grain importers.

After the Chinese team took the lead at 21: 19, it won the match point with Jutting's strong smash and Zhang Changning's attack at 24: 21; then the Turkish team chased the score to 23: 24. After the Chinese team requested a suspension, Zhang Changning attacked the score, and the Chinese team locked the victory with 25: 23.
Lang Ping, head coach of the Chinese Women's Volleyball Team, admitted after the game that the whole game was not easy.
"We are better prepared, the blocking is good, the Turkish team is more comprehensive, we must reduce mistakes and strive to win through their own initiative."
Facing her former familiar teammates, Jutting, who played for the Turkish Wakiver Bank team, was subject to many restrictions in the first game of the day. Then she took the initiative to change and still played a strong attack.
"And the opponent is very familiar with each other, it is normal to be targeted by the opponent, but the Chinese team played to the extreme, blocking and attacking in the case of a bad pass."
Next, the Chinese women's volleyball team will hold a one-day truce for physical and technical training; on October 2, it will face the third opponent of the group match, Canada.

Nearly a thousand state-owned scenic spots cut ticket prices by more than 20%
[Abstract] As of September 28, all localities have implemented or issued a letter to announce 981 scenic spots free opening or price reduction measures (free opening 74, price reduction 907), Yunnan Shilin, Dali Three Pagodas, Yulong Snow Mountain, Guangxi Guilin Lijiang, Fujian Wuyi Mountain, Hunan Zhangjiajie, Shaanxi Terra Cotta Warriors, Jiangxi Sanqing Mountain, Xinjiang and other scenic spots.
In order to implement the decision and deployment of the Central Economic Work Conference and the "Government Work Report," the National Development and Reform Commission issued the "Guiding Opinions on Perfecting the Ticket Price Formation Mechanism of State-owned Scenic Areas to Reduce the Ticket Price of Key State-owned Scenic Areas" on June 28 (hereinafter referred to as the Guiding Opinions), which requires that the state-owned scenic spots be reasonably defined in terms of ticket pricing cost composition, innovative price management methods, strict implementation of pricing procedures, etc. Improve the state-owned scenic spot ticket price formation mechanism by the end of September.
All localities have actively carried out work in accordance with the deployment requirements, and have successively reduced the ticket prices of a number of key state-owned scenic spots.
As of September 28, all localities have implemented or issued a letter to announce 981 scenic spots free of charge or price reduction measures (74 free of charge, 907 price reduction), including 159 5A scenic spots and 534 4A scenic spots, with a total of 693, accounting for 70.6%.
Of the 907 scenic spots that cut prices, 491 fell by more than 20%, accounting for 54.3%, and 214 fell by more than 30%, accounting for 23.6%.
Yunnan, Shandong, Guangxi, Shaanxi and other provinces have a large number of price reduction scenic spots, among which the number of price reduction scenic spots in Yunnan is over 100, and the overall decline is more than 30%.
Anhui, Chongqing and other 8 provinces (districts, cities) government pricing 5A scenic spots all achieved price reductions.
Yunnan Shilin, Dali Three Pagodas, Yulong Snow Mountain, Guangxi Guilin Lijiang, Fujian Wuyi Mountain, Hunan Zhangjiajie, Shaanxi Terra Cotta Warriors and Horses, Jiangxi Sanqing Mountain, Xinjiang Kanas and other scenic spots have implemented price reductions.
The gradual return of ticket prices in key state-owned scenic spots to a reasonable range is conducive to promoting the transformation and upgrading of tourism from ticket economy to industrial economy, niche tourism to mass tourism, scenic spot tourism to global tourism, and is conducive to the formation of a virtuous circle of optimization of tourism supply structure and steady expansion of tourism consumption demand, and promoting the sustainable and healthy development of scenic spots and tourism.
At the same time, the National Development and Reform Commission stressed that all localities should strengthen the price order of scenic spots, guide scenic spots to upgrade services, and ensure that price cuts do not reduce quality.
In addition, the National Development and Reform Commission has carried out special inspections on the issues of the recent decline in the ticket prices of individual scenic spots reflected by the media, and the National Development and Reform Commission has conducted special inspections, requiring all localities to deal with them seriously, respond to social concerns in a timely manner, and effectively implement price cuts.
CCPIT to carry out short, medium and long-term optimization work in an orderly manner
The Macao Trade and Investment Promotion Bureau has submitted a report on the short, medium and long-term optimization of "major investment immigrants" and "skilled immigrants." At present, in addition to stepping up and implementing the work in the report, it has also continuously listened to social opinions and continuously optimized the content of the report and related work.
The CCPIT will introduce the relevant optimization work to the community as soon as possible.
Of these, 5 are short-term measures carried out this year; 5 are medium-term measures carried out in 2019; and 1 is long-term measures.
In addition, the CCPIT has also conducted a comprehensive review of its internal management system in accordance with the instructions of the Financial Secretary, Mr David Leung.
The five short-term measures carried out during this year include:
1. Conduct review work. Priority is given to reviewing cases that are about to expire for 7 years, cases mentioned in the ICAC report, and new renewal cases. If cases of misconduct or illegal signs are found, they will be referred to the relevant judicial authorities for follow-up;
2. Field inspection of projects involving "major investment migrants." By late September, more than 20 investment projects had been inspected;
3. Conduct a comprehensive review of the current assessment system. In the assessment of "major investment immigration" applications, six principles for analyzing investment projects have been re-established. In the assessment of "skilled immigration" applications, the relevant approval mechanism will be improved by clarifying the elements that are conducive to the development of Australia and the conditions for attracting talents. At the same time, a list of "five industries and ten types of talents" has been set up for the annual priority introduction of talents to meet the direction of the SAR Government.
4. Increasing the transparency of information. Including the plan to gradually announce the approval criteria, scoring criteria and proportion from the fourth quarter of this year, and further refine and disclose the approval data;
5. In terms of improving the work of the confirmation mechanism, it has been required to check the work in Australia before confirmation; major investments must go to the scene to check and submit financial statements.
The five medium-term measures to be carried out in 2019 include:
1. Establish a mechanism to regularly listen to the views of the Talent Development Committee and the Economic Development Committee. In September, a working meeting was held with the Economic Development Committee to discuss the establishment of the relevant mechanism.
2. Require the applicant to submit annual financial statements made by independent third parties to continuously examine the operation status of the investment project;

National non-film cotton on-site observation and discussion exchange experts into the test field, listen to the representative of the Chinese Academy of Engineering Yu Shuxun team.
Xinhuanet Xinjiang Shaya September 30th (Geng Dandan Wang Xiaojun) is located in the non-film cotton planting test base in Shaya County, Xinjiang. The non-film cotton is growing happily, compared with the mulch cotton next to it, "no less," a cluster of snow-white cotton is competing to "open," and it is covered with branches.
From September 27th to 28th, the national non-film cotton on-site observation and discussion exchange activities were held in Shaya County, Xinjiang.
The reporter learned at the observation meeting that the non-film cotton technology system with "China Cotton 619" and its supporting cultivation measures as the main body has initially achieved the goal of non-membrane planting in cotton fields, reducing the pollution of Xinjiang cotton fields on ecological environment and raw cotton, and the research and demonstration of non-film cotton comprehensive technology has made significant progress.
Academician Yu Shuxun, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, a famous cotton genetic breeder and chief scientist of the national modern agricultural industry technology system, introduced the growth of non-membrane cotton to Zhou Guomao, secretary of the party committee of Zhejiang Agricultural and Forestry University.
"The comprehensive technology of non-film cotton developed by us can fully realize cotton planting without mulch, which can completely solve the problem of residual film pollution and achieve green cotton planting."
Yu Shuxun, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, introduced.
Xinjiang is the most important cotton-producing area in China. According to the statistics of the National Bureau of Statistics, the cotton planting area in Xinjiang in 2017 was 35 million mu, accounting for 61% of the national cotton area.
Since the introduction of plastic film in China in 1982, the area of various crops in Xinjiang has reached more than 50 million mu, and the annual use of plastic film is about 300,000 tons.
Among them, the cotton mulch coverage rate reached 100%, and the cotton field mulch accounted for about 60% of the use of mulch in Xinjiang.
Non-film cotton production, cotton production can achieve 320 kg to 350 kg per mu.
With the increasing input of mulch film in Xinjiang, the recovery rate of residual mulch film is low, the amount of residual film in the soil is gradually increasing, and the residual film causes soil structure damage, which seriously affects the sustainable development of agriculture.
The residual film not only causes serious pollution to the soil, but also has a great impact on the quality of cotton fiber.
At present, more than 1 / 3 of the cotton fields in Xinjiang have achieved mechanized harvesting.
In 2017, Xinjiang machine mining area of about 14 million mu.
Machine cotton harvest process income of a large number of surface, cotton broken film, doped in the original cotton broken film in the original cotton processing process is difficult to remove, in the follow-up textile processing process can not be completely removed, seriously affecting the quality of textile products.
On September 28th, the national non-film cotton on-site observation and discussion exchange activities were held in Shaya County, Xinjiang.
In order to focus on solving the pollution of cotton field mulch, simplifying cotton planting technology, and improving the benefits of cotton fields, Yu Shuxun led his team to implement the "China Cotton 619" non-membrane cotton technology planting through 8 years, and "added wings" for Xinjiang's agricultural green development.
Yu Shuxun introduced that through innovative breeding new ideas, a new line of land cotton "Chinese cotton 619" with special early maturity, salinity, low temperature and high yield was cultivated.
"Under the conditions of non-membrane cultivation in southern Xinjiang, the 'China Cotton 619' has realized a series of supporting measures such as non-membrane seeding machinery, deep improvement of sowing, shallow burying of drip belt under non-membrane conditions, suitable sowing density screening, and reasonable chemical regulation."
At present, Aksu, Kurle, Arar and other places have established a demonstration base of non-film cotton, with a yield of 4,800 kg per hectare.
Membrane-free planting of cotton, to achieve high yield, cost-saving, environmental protection, comprehensive benefits.
Zhang Donghai, an agronomist at the Agricultural Research Institute of the Third Division of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, said that through the research and demonstration of non-film cotton cultivation techniques in the past six years, the production of non-film cotton seed cotton can achieve a yield of 320 kg to 350 kg, or even higher.
"The promotion of non-membrane cotton cultivation technology has great prospects."
Zhang Donghai believes that at present, the cultivation technology of non-membrane cotton can completely solve the problem of soil residual film pollution, but there is still a certain gap in economic benefits compared with mulch cultivation.
"The support of cotton purchase price will be conducive to future promotion."
Yu Shuxun said that in the next step, he and his team will continue to conduct in-depth research and large-scale application of non-film cotton, and make the industry of non-film cotton bigger and stronger, and completely solve the problem of soil pollution caused by mulch.

In a speech delivered at the US Foreign Relations Committee on Friday, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that at present, Sino-US relations have once again reached a crossroads. If the two sides can actively and inclusive look at each other, expand and deepen positive cooperation, and properly manage differences and contradictions, they can open up better prospects.
"Sino-US relations are our common assets and we need to take care of them together."
He expressed the hope that people of insight from all walks of life in the two countries will take concrete actions to maintain the healthy and stable development of Sino-US relations and jointly promote Sino-US relations in the right direction.
Wang Yi also once again stressed that China will definitely walk out of a different development path from the traditional big countries.
This road with Chinese characteristics determines that China will not and cannot repeat the mistakes of national strength and hegemony. It also determines that China will neither become the United States, nor challenge the United States, nor replace the United States.
In a speech entitled "Opportunity or Challenge, Partner or Opponent," Wang Yi said that the deep-seated crux of the current problem is that some American friends believe that China will also be strong and will even challenge and replace the US leadership in the world.
"This is obviously a major strategic miscalculation."
He said that this suspicion with self-imagination is spreading, and it has magnified the contradictions that exist, spawned new doubts, and also made it more difficult to solve specific problems between China and the United States and encountered more resistance.
Wang Yi pointed out that China is following a path of peaceful development.
The Chinese have never had the gene for external expansion.
It is believed that all countries can live in harmony and exchange and learn from each other.
Whether in the past, present or future, China will neither copy foreign models nor ask other countries to copy China's practices.
Earlier, when Wang Yi met with former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in New York, he said that Sino-US cooperation will be win-win, and confrontation will inevitably lose.
China has always been committed to developing long-term, healthy and stable Sino-US relations and achieving non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation.

After querying the train schedule, Mr. Song found that the first bus can arrive at 7: 3 am and connect the city transportation to the Golden Bauhinia Square. The time is just right.
He lamented with the reporter: "The high-speed rail is too convenient, and it is fast and accurate!"
Daily 70 short-haul trains between Guangzhou South, Shenzhen North and Futian and West Kowloon within one hour have greatly facilitated the arrival of residents in the Tai Wan area of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao.
After Mr. Liu, who lives in Shenzhen, arrived in Hong Kong, he was preparing to go to the Hong Kong friends of the Central Peak.
Mr. Liu said: "The Mainland and Hong Kong have holidays on the National Day. We intend to challenge ourselves to see if we can complete the 50-kilometer Hong Kong Island Trail!"
He explained that if the high-speed rail is not opened, the traffic is convenient, and the time is sufficient, they dare not easily try such a long-distance mountain activity.
Mrs. Yang, from Dongguan, took her 10-year-old son to Hong Kong by high-speed rail to participate in the piano competition. She proudly told reporters that her son has been studying piano for three years. It is very meaningful to spend the National Day in this way.
She has been taking a bus to Hong Kong before, but it is time-consuming and labor-intensive. She is worried about affecting her son's status. This time, she came by Shenzhen by high-speed rail. The customs clearance is convenient and the time is halved. The journey of the Hong Kong section is even more impressive. She said to the reporter: "It seems to take the subway, especially fast, I have not had time to take pictures!"
At 6: 44 on September 23, the G5711 "Harmony" high-speed rail train set off from Shenzhen North Railway Station and galloped all the way. After a few minutes, the train entered the Hong Kong section of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong high-speed rail. This is the first officially operated high-speed rail train ushered in by the Hong Kong section.
Integration into the country's 25,000-kilometer high-speed rail network, direct access to the country's 38 long-distance stations of the high-speed rail Hong Kong section, also ushered in different provinces in the south and north of the mainland passengers.
Mr. Gao, who came to visit relatives from Changsha on a long vacation, told reporters that before the high-speed rail could only sit in the north of Shenzhen, take the subway to pass Hong Kong and then transfer to the city's transportation. The transfer is troublesome and time-consuming. Now sit directly in the Kowloon Center and can eat the lunch made by the children at home. I feel very happy.
He said that the convenience of the "one place and two inspections" customs clearance procedures is beyond imagination. "Less than 10 minutes, both customs have passed."
West Kowloon Station, which is adjacent to the Airport Express and connects land and air traffic, has also become the first choice for many transit passengers.
Miss Wu from Fujian is preparing to spend the Golden Week with her girlfriends from Hong Kong to the Philippines. She pushed her luggage at the West Kowloon Gate and said to the reporter: "I was afraid of not catching up with the plane. I didn't expect it to be so fast. More than enough time!"
According to the subsidiary arrangement of the trade agreement announced on Monday, the new US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement will retain US President Trump's ability to implement the threat of a 25% tariff on imported cars, while basically exempting passenger cars, pickups and auto parts imported from Canada and Mexico from paying tariffs.
If Trump imposes a so-called "232 chapter" tariff on cars for national security reasons, then Mexico and Canada will have a quota of 2.6 million passenger cars exported to the United States each year.
According to the subsidiary arrangement, the pickup trucks produced in the two countries will be completely exempted from tariffs.
If Trump imposes auto tariffs, Mexico will receive an annual tax exemption quota of $108 billion for auto parts, and Canada will receive a quota of $32.4 billion.
Both quotas are much higher than the existing production levels of the two countries, providing room for growth for exports from the two countries.
WASHINGTON / MEXICO, September 28 (Reuters) - Mexico said on Friday that after several days of debate, US President Trump's government and Canada are making practical efforts to resolve trade policy differences, making the outside world hope that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is expected to maintain the tripartite agreement.
Although there is a lack of details, the above obvious progress is enough to prompt the Mexican and US governments to suddenly stop publishing the text of the two-party trade agreement and give Canada more time to join the agreement.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told reporters in Mexico that the US government has made new counter-proposals to the Canadian government and said that he will continue to promote the participation of all three countries in NAFTA.
Mexico's economy minister, Ildefonso Guajardo, said that the time to submit the text of the US-Mexico trade agreement to Mexico and the US legislation was postponed because the Canadian and US governments "very seriously" tried to reach an agreement.
"In the next 48 hours, we will know whether we have reached a text of the tripartite agreement or have to publish the text of the two-party agreement," Guajardo said.
Guajardo said that his US and Canadian counterparts "specifically requested" to delay the release of the text.
A spokesman for the US Trade Representative's Office (USTR) did not comment on the text of the US-Mexico trade agreement and the US-Canada consultation.
Officials from the Canadian Prime Minister's Office and the Foreign Minister's Office did not respond to requests for comment on the counter-proposal.
According to foreign media reports, in a conservation center on the outskirts of Pretoria, the South African capital, two lions play together, and it is difficult to see any abnormalities, but they are unique.
The University of Pretoria announced: "This is the first young lion born by artificial insemination - the first pair in the world."
Scientists in the school are working hard to study the reproductive system of female African lions.
Gans Winter, director of the Institute of Mammal Research at the University of Pretoria, said that the two cubs born on August 25 are a male and female, quite healthy and normal.
After 18 months of intensive testing, his team finally reached this breakthrough.
"We collected sperm from a healthy lion," Ganswint said in a media interview.
Next, the researchers artificially inseminated the female lion when the hormone content in the body reached the appropriate level.
"Luckily, it turned out to be successful," Mr Ganswint said.
He said that the researchers "made several attempts, but unexpectedly, they did not spend much effort."
He said that the above research breakthroughs can be verified repeatedly, and scientists hope to use this technology to save endangered large cats.
The International Union for Conservation of Nature pointed out that lions have become extinct in 26 countries in Africa, and the total number of surviving wild lions has dropped by 43% in the past 20 years, leaving only about 20,000.
The African lion is listed as a vulnerable animal by this organization.
"If we don't do something for this animal, they will face extinction," Ganswint said.
He said that this new technology does not require the lion to be raised, but only the sperm is injected into the pregnant lioness, just like the North American and European practices for captive elephants.
South Korea's exports fell by the most in more than two years in September, but analysts attributed the decline to fewer working days and said that despite the rising trade tensions between China and the United States, global demand for Korean goods is still strong.
Indeed, South Korea's average daily exports increased last month.
In addition, the initial data released earlier showed double-digit growth in exports in the first weeks of September before the long holiday.
South Korea's exports fell year-on-year in September, the largest decline since July 2016, and the decline was greater than the 5.7% decline estimated by 11 analysts surveyed by Reuters.
The initial value released on Monday showed that exports in September were 50.6 billion US dollars, down from 51.2 billion US dollars in August.
Although the growing US-China trade dispute may cause other export-dependent Chinese neighbors to suffer, South Korea's exports to China grew by 7.8% in September, expanding for the 23rd consecutive month.
South Korea's exports to the United States fell by 11.8%, due to the decline in oil product sales.
Overseas sales of Korean memory chips and petroleum products increased by 28.3% and 13.5% respectively, although the market is worried that the so-called "super cycle" of chips may have peaked.
"However, the impact of trade conflicts will be difficult to avoid, because South Korea's exports depend to a considerable extent on the US and Chinese markets."
Imports fell 2.1% to 40.8 billion US dollars, which is not as good as the growth of 3.1% in the Reuters survey.
The initial trade surplus in September was $9.7 billion, up from $6.9 billion in August.
The Ministry of Industry said that thanks to the United States and EU countries, global manufacturing will remain prosperous, which is a favorable factor for South Korean exports.
The statement pointed out that "the increase in export prices caused by rising oil prices will also be beneficial to exports in the second half of this year."
"However, the continuation of the trade conflict between the United States and China, coupled with the increase in market volatility after the US interest rate hike, is a negative pressure on exports."
Exports per working day increased to $2.6 billion in September and $2.1 billion in August.
South Korea's Mid-Autumn Festival falls on September 24-26, so there are only 19.5 working days in September, four days less than the same period last year.
South Korea's exports from January to September increased by 4.7% compared with the same period last year.
According to the Nikkei / Markit Purchasing Managers Index, South Korean manufacturing activity rebounded in September, but was supported by domestic orders, because orders from China and Japan fell, which may cast another export outlook.
North Korean media criticized the United States for not relaxing sanctions against North Korea
North Korea's "Labor News" published an op-ed article on September 30, criticizing the United States for seeking dialogue with the DPRK while not relaxing sanctions against the DPRK, saying that this is a "contradictory" practice.
The article said that US Secretary of State Pompeo said on the 14th that "in order to realize the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, the key is to fulfill the sanctions against the DPRK," emphasizing that the US position of continuing to implement the UN sanctions resolution remains unchanged.
In the Singapore DPRK-US Joint Statement, the two sides pledged to establish a new DPRK-US relationship that is compatible with the aspirations of the Korean and US peoples for peace and prosperity.
It is undoubtedly contradictory for the United States to increase the intensity of sanctions and suppress, and to demand dialogue.
The article said that if we want to establish a new DPRK-US relationship, build a permanently consolidated peace system on the Korean Peninsula, and realize the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, we should put building trust in the first place, starting from what can be done, and solve it one by one.
The article also said that the United States should understand that sanctions and suppression are not feasible for North Korea.
The article said that even the "North Devonsk" before the "Kazan" also let the US military praise.
"National Interest" magazine quoted the US Navy as saying: "We will encounter a strong potential opponent. It is enough to look at the North Devonsk submarine."
Fugo, the current commander-in-chief of the US Navy in Europe, also praised the "North Devonsk" submarine.
"This submarine is impressive. Looking at the development of the Russian navy and how to use resources, you will know that its main efforts in research and development are first and foremost to strengthen the submarine fleet," he said.
But National Interest magazine still believes that the United States maintains an advantage over Russia in this field.
"I believe that Western countries still have asymmetric advantages," Fogo said.
Earlier, it was reported that the Russian Navy will install the "Kazan" submarine in 2019.
"Kazan," "Novosibirsk," "Krasnoyarsk" and "Arkhangelsk" multi-purpose submarines are all "White Wax Tree-M" improved, with a displacement of 13,800 tons, a dive depth of 520 meters, a staffing of 64 people, and an underwater speed of 31 knots. It will carry mines, torpedoes and "caliber" cruise missiles.

In recent years, the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television has repeatedly stopped illegal advertisements.
This year, the State Administration of Radio and Television issued a notice to publicly stop the advertisements of "0 bubble fruit milk," "Shawa cocktail" and "Bonritt plant anti-debreeding and revealing" and other serious violations such as exaggerating and exaggerating propaganda and misleading the audience.
The State Administration of Radio, Film and Television has formulated a number of laws and regulations and circulars to regulate the behavior of radio and television advertisements.
"Notice on Further Strengthening the Advertising Management of TV Shopping Short Films on TV Channel" stipulates that TV shopping short advertisements may not be broadcast during the period from 18: 00 to 24: 00 every day.

"For the first time, we have adjusted the format of the MAKS International Aerospace Salon. We suggest that China be the host country. The Chinese counterparts agreed and accepted our invitation," Manturov said.
Not long ago, Chinese President Xi Jinping attended the 4th Eastern Economic Forum at the invitation of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
This is his first time to attend the forum.
Ignore the American threat!
The EU may reach a crude oil procurement agreement with Iran
The US government has announced that it will restart a new round of sanctions against Iran in November, and even urged other countries to reduce imports of Iranian oil.
However, US allies do not seem to listen.
According to the US "New York Times" report, on the 29th, Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif revealed that although the United States threatened to sanction any country that does business with Iran, Tehran is close to reaching an agreement with the European Union on crude oil sales.
The core purpose of this agreement is to try to establish a new payment mechanism, that is, to replace US dollar transactions with barter or local currency pricing.
The purpose of the method is to bypass the United States and prevent the United States from obstructing financial transfers.
At the same time, although the EU is working to promote the agreement, some French and British officials are also worried that if the agreement is realized, this will be the most open confrontation between the EU and the United States that oppose the US withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear agreement.
In an hour-long interview, Zarif's words sounded more optimistic than in recent months, the US media said.
Because the agreement has the ability to "divest" the traditional allies of the United States and effectively break the US attempt to cut Iran's income.
"This will ensure that we sell oil and benefit," Zarif said. According to the agreement reached in 2015, countries have the legal right to trade with Iran.
EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini also said recently that "no sovereign state or organization can accept others to decide who they can trade with."
However, she also predicted that before the US government launched the next sanctions in November, US leaders may adopt a series of financial means aimed at banks, businessmen and countries that have business dealings with Tehran.
In May, the US government unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear agreement on the grounds that the agreement was flawed, and said that the agreement could not permanently ban Iran from producing nuclear fuel.
The US subsequently threatened to ban companies that buy Iranian oil and other commodities from doing business in the United States.
This threat caused some companies to withdraw from Tehran and the Iranian currency plummeted.
Companies such as Airbus and French oil giant Total have cancelled billions of dollars of investment in Iraq.
British and French officials have said that the US government may "prevail."
Sure enough, according to a recent Turkish media report, the US sanctions do not seem to have had a great impact on Iran's oil exports.
Iranian Oil Minister Zangane has revealed that no other country except South Korea has stopped buying Iranian oil.
Zarif and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani both believe that the purpose of a series of US actions is to "tempt" Iran to violate the agreement.
Zarif was also disdainful of the US's series of verbal attacks. When asked whether the United States will overthrow the current Iranian government with increasing financial pressure, Zarif even laughed. "It is a strategy of regime change. This is the real purpose of the US."

In order to further encourage foreign investors to invest in China, the Ministry of Finance of China and other four ministries and commissions jointly announced that since January 1, 2018, the profits distributed by foreign investors from Chinese domestic resident enterprises will be used for domestic direct investment. The scope of application of the withholding income tax policy will be expanded from foreign investment encouragement projects to all non-prohibited foreign investment projects and fields.
According to the relevant notice published on the website of the Ministry of Finance, foreign investors must meet several conditions at the same time, including direct investment by foreign investors to share profits, including capital increase, new construction, equity acquisition and other equity investment behaviors by foreign investors to share profits, but does not include new, increased, and acquired shares of listed companies (except for eligible strategic investments).

The reporter learned from the National Health Committee that compared with decades ago, the incidence of malnutrition among children and adolescents in China has declined, and the incidence of overweight and obesity has increased significantly.
Experts pointed out that to maintain a healthy weight, the most important concept is to "cure the disease" and vigorously promote scientific fitness and reasonable diet.
According to the "China Youth Health Education Core Information and Interpretation (2018 Edition)" recently released by the National Health Committee, the key to maintaining a healthy weight is reasonable diet and scientific exercise.
Overweight, obesity and blind weight loss are not conducive to health.
The health hidden danger behind "Little Fat Dun" cannot be ignored.
Ding Gangqiang, director of the Institute of Nutrition and Health of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said that overweight and obesity endanger the normal growth and development of teenagers, and have adverse effects on their psychology, behavior, cognition and intelligence, and even lead to high blood pressure, high blood sugar and high blood lipids in children.
At the same time, adolescent overweight and obesity are easy to continue into adulthood, which will increase the risk of chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes in adulthood.
Ding Gangqiang said that from 2010 to 2012, the nutrition and health status of Chinese residents showed that the overweight rate of children aged 6-17 years in China was 9.6%, and the obesity rate was 6.4%, which added up to 16%.
At the same time, the overweight obesity of children and adolescents is higher than that of girls, and the urban obesity rate is higher than that of rural areas. The overweight obesity rate has increased significantly in recent decades.
How do teenagers deal with overweight and obesity?
Zhang Wei, deputy director of the Scientific Fitness and Health Promotion Research Center of the State General Administration of Sport, pointed out that the main reasons for adolescent obesity are excessive calorie intake and insufficient physical activity.
For this simple obesity, we should pay attention to scientific exercise and reasonable dietary control.
Zhang Wei pointed out that the most important concept of maintaining a healthy weight is to "cure the disease." A very important part of this is to conduct comprehensive popular science education for schools, parents and students, popularize the dangers of overweight and obesity, and improve the awareness of young people.
Adolescents should have regular physical examinations, monitor growth and development indicators such as height and weight, and detect and scientifically judge whether there are overweight and obesity problems in order to take timely interventions.
For teenagers who are already overweight and obese, Ding Gangqiang suggested that in addition to actively and scientifically arranging meals and exercise, teenagers are in a special physiological stage. They should avoid using hunger or semi-hunger therapy to control and reduce weight, and must not blindly take weight loss drugs.
Reuters September 28 - Facebook (FB.O) said on Friday that hackers stole digital landing codes, giving them access to nearly 50 million user accounts, which is unprecedented and is the most serious security vulnerability in its history.
Facebook has more than 2.2 billion monthly users, saying that it has not yet determined whether the attacker abused any accounts or stole personal information.
The company also did not find the location of the hacker and is not sure whether the hacker targeted specific victims.
Its preliminary analysis shows that this is a large-scale attack.
Chief Executive Zuckerberg called the incident "really serious" in a media conference call.
A spokesman for the company said that his account number and the account of the operator Sheryl Sandberg were also affected.
Facebook shares fell 2.6% on Friday, dragging down Wall Street's major stock indexes.
U.S. lawmakers said Friday that the attack may increase the outside world's calls for data privacy legislation.
"This is another sad evidence that Congress needs to take action to protect the privacy and security of social media users," Democratic Senator Mark Warner said in a statement.
Rohit Chopra, a member of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), tweeted that I hope to get answers to the Reuters report on the security vulnerability.

Yichang, October 1, ZXS (Guo Xiaoying Liu Min) The newly revised "Three Gorges-Gezhouba Water Conservancy Project Navigation and Dispatching Regulations" (hereinafter referred to as "Dispatching Regulations") officially began to be implemented on October 1. After two years of trial navigation, the Three Gorges ship lift was officially unified with the ship lock.
On the first day of the implementation of the new regulations, the navigation order of the Three Gorges-Gezhouba waters was good.
The Yangtze River Three Gorges Navigation Administration issued the first security check plan at 21: 00 on September 30, and conducted security checks on 160 ships. A total of 124 ships passed the security check.
At 1400 hours on October 1, the navigation department arranged the first crossing plan after the implementation of the new regulations.
After the implementation of the new regulations, the security plan will be issued at 9: 00 and 21: 00 every day, and the dam plan will be issued at 14: 00 and 20: 00 every day, so that the ship can flexibly arrange the dam plan.
The "Dispatching Regulations" adds the principle of "classification control" for the ship's dam-crossing dispatching. According to the functional positioning of the ship lock and the ship lifter, the priority order of the ship crossing the dam is clearly defined, and the short-term passenger ship that passes the gate is adjusted to the same priority level as the demonstration ship and the integrity ship.
This is also the second anniversary of the trial operation of the ship lift, officially and the ship lock unified dispatching.
And the Chuanjiang River and the Three Gorges reservoir area big long and wide demonstration ship, the new energy power ship also entered the priority level for the first time.
At the same time, the "Dispatching Regulations" will adjust the "navigable dispatching management waters" from the previous 180 kilometers near the dam waters to the Yunyang Yangtze River Bridge to the Shishou Yangtze River Bridge 541.8 kilometers of waters, and divide the "core waters, near the dam waters, control waters, dispatching waters."
This is conducive to the shipowner to choose suitable waters to be locked and reduce the backlog of ships to be locked in the dam area.
According to the characteristics of the current ship crossing the dam and waiting for the gate, the "Dispatching Regulations" also puts forward the integrity control measures such as the cancellation declaration of the offending ship and the 24-hour delay in crossing the dam.
After the Three Gorges water storage, the navigation conditions in the reservoir area have been improved, which promotes the rapid development of the Yangtze River shipping.
According to the data, the annual cargo throughput of the Three Gorges Shiplock and Gezhouba Shiplock increased from 34.3 million tons in 2004 to 138 million tons and 140 million tons in 2017.
Three Gorges ship lift test navigation in the past two years through the ship 5767 times, 162.2 million passengers, cargo volume of 171.28 million tons.
Chen Dongyuan, deputy director of the Three Gorges Navigation Administration, said that the "Dispatching Regulations" has a positive effect on promoting the management of the two dams, maintaining the navigation order of the two dams, relieving the pressure of the ships in the dam area, and improving the navigation capacity.

In September, China's comprehensive PMI improved the manufacturing PMI chain.
China's National Bureau of Statistics released data on the 30th. In September, China's comprehensive PMI output index was 54.1%, which was higher than the previous month and the annual average of 0.3 and 0.1 percentage points, indicating that the overall production and operation activities of Chinese enterprises remained stable.
In the month, the manufacturing production index and the non-manufacturing business activity index, which constitute the comprehensive PMI output index, were 53.0% and 54.9% respectively, down one liter from the previous month.
Among them, China's manufacturing PMI was 50.8%, which fell by 0.5 percentage points.
Zhao Qinghe said that this month's manufacturing PMI has five main characteristics:
First, the fundamentals of the manufacturing industry are generally stable.
Among the 21 industries surveyed, the PMI of 14 industries is located in the expansion range, among which the manufacturing PMI of medicine, special equipment, electrical machinery and equipment is located at a higher operating level of more than 53.5%, and the growth rate is faster.
Second, supply and demand fluctuate slightly.
The production index and the new order index were 53.0% and 52.0%, respectively, down 0.3 and 0.2 percentage points from the previous month. The supply and demand continued to maintain a state of prosperity, but the expansion slowed down slightly.
The new export orders index and the import index were 48.0% and 48.5%, respectively, lower than the previous month's 1.4 and 0.6 percentage points, and the prosperity fell to the low point of the year.
Fourth, the cost of purchasing raw materials for enterprises has increased.

Nagoya (Reuters) - Bank of Japan President Haruhiko Kuroda said on Monday that the central bank realized that the long-term implementation of ultra-loose monetary policy may squeeze the profit margins of financial institutions and may undermine the stability of the country's banking system.
But he said that given the low inflation and uncertainty in overseas economies, the Bank of Japan needs to maintain its large-scale stimulus plan and pay close attention to the pros and cons of its policies.
"The Bank of Japan fully recognizes that under the continuous monetary easing, the strength of financial institutions will be increasingly affected," Kuroda said in a speech to business leaders in Nagoya.
He said that if financial institutions are more active in taking risks to make up for the narrowing of profit margins caused by low interest rates over the years, there may be turbulence in the banking system in the event of a serious negative impact.
"Although these risks are not great at present, the central bank will pay close attention to the development of the situation and encourage financial institutions to take necessary measures," he said.
The minutes of the Bank of Japan's meeting released earlier on Monday showed that at the September meeting, the Bank of Japan's policy committee discussed the rising cost of long-term easing.
The minutes show that one member said that if the economy continues to expand, "the Bank of Japan will have more flexibility in policy in the future."
The minutes showed that another member said that in view of the limitations of the policy duration, the committee should discuss how long the Bank of Japan can maintain the stimulus policy.
Kuroda said that the Bank of Japan will assess the financial risks caused by easing policies, and also need to consider the uncertainty surrounding Japan's economic outlook. Due to Sino-US trade frictions and rising protectionism, it may affect global demand.
"The impact of such problems on the Japanese economy is limited for the time being," Kuroda said.
"But how the problem continues, the impact on the Japanese economy may become greater," he added.
"It is necessary to continuously carry out strong monetary easing policies and consider positive and negative effects in a balanced way," Kuroda said.
Although the drawbacks of the aggressive stimulus plan have increased, such as long-term low interest rates eroding the profits of financial institutions, the low inflation has forced the Bank of Japan to maintain the plan.
The Bank of Japan maintained monetary policy last month; in the face of the risks posed by the global trade war, Kuroda ruled out the possibility of raising interest rates in the near future.
The corporate logo on Tesla's electric car in Cardiff, United States, June 1, 2018.
Under a settlement agreement, Tesla Motors and its CEO Musk have agreed to pay a fine of 20 million US dollars to financial regulators. Musk will also resign as chairman of the company, but still serve as CEO.
The settlement will put an end to Tesla's two-month turmoil.
The settlement of securities fraud charges disclosed by the Securities and Exchange Commission on Saturday will give investors a sigh of relief.
Investors had feared that the protracted legal battle would only further crack down on the electric car company, which is still losing money.
The SEC sued Musk for fraud on Thursday, saying its August 7 tweet misled investors.
Tweet said that he is considering privatizing Tesla for $420 per share and has obtained financing.
According to the SEC, these tweets are actually unfounded, and the market turmoil caused by them has damaged investors.
Investors and corporate governance experts said that the agreement may strengthen Tesla, which has been hit hard by Musk's recent behavior.
Steven Heim, head of asset management at Boston Common, said the settlement should subject Musk to more supervision and did not take the "devastating" measures to drive him out of Tesla.
The asset management company holds shares in Tesla's battery maker Panasonic.
Under the proposed agreement, Tesla must appoint an independent chairman, two independent directors and a board committee to develop control over Musk's external communication.
"It is in the best interests of our market and our investors, including Tesla shareholders, for this matter to be resolved quickly in accordance with the agreed conditions," SEC Chairman Clayton said in a statement.
Thursday's allegations caused Tesla's market value to evaporate by about $7 billion. The company's market value was $45.2 billion on Friday, lower than GM's $47.5 billion.
In the settlement agreement, the SEC withdrew the request to drive Musk out of the company's position.
Many investors said that this penalty will be disastrous.
"I think this is the best possible result for all relevant personnel," said Ivan Feinseth of Tigres Financial Partners. Feinseth gave Tesla a "neutral" rating and said that the SEC's punishment is a "lenient punishment" for Musk.
"It is important for Tesla that he still serve as CEO."
Neither Musk nor Tesla admitted or denied the SEC's allegations in the settlement agreement, and did not immediately return a request for comment.
The settlement still needs to be approved by the court.
Beijing Morning News (Reporter Wang Ping) Beijing Morning News reporter recently learned from the Beijing Construction Group that one of the core buildings of the 2019 Beijing World Expo Park - the Beijing World Expo Performing Arts Plaza project will adopt a multi-color ETFE puzzle film structure for the first time. 5440 square meters of film structure will present deep red, dark green, orange, blue, red, green 6 colors, showing the shape of the butterfly wing under the cable.
According to Liu Changbao, the project leader of Beijing Construction Wujian Group, the construction area of the Performing Arts Plaza project is 4500 square meters, the total amount of steel installed is 1182 tons, and the steel roof is supported by 26 cantilevered steel trusses, showing the shape of "butterfly wing" under the tension of the cable steel strand.
"Overlooking the performing arts square from the air, the colorful roof is like a butterfly that wears flowers and dances, and the bright colors will not gradually fade due to time and wind, frost, rain and snow."
Previously, the monochrome ETFE membrane structure has been widely used in Bird's Nest, Water Cube and other projects, but the multi-color puzzle ETFE membrane structure is still the first in the country.
Reporter learned that because the world has a variety of color membrane structure production capacity of very few suppliers, so every inch of membrane structure materials are very "precious."
Liu Changbao said that in order to avoid problems such as overlapping and "fighting" at the end of the cable, the "double fork ear" cable head structure will be innovated to ensure that the "fight" cable head is collected in the correct position through a special fixed plug-in.
At present, the construction of the 2019 Beijing World Expo Park is under way.
Among them, the international pavilion project has completed the lifting construction of all "flower umbrellas."
According to the plan, the project will be ready for exhibition at the end of October.

General Secretary Xi Jinping delivered a very important speech at the private enterprise symposium, injecting firm confidence into the broader stage of the private economy.
General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed that "let entrepreneurs unload their ideological burdens and move forward lightly" has aroused strong resonance among the vast number of entrepreneurs and innovative entrepreneurs.
Market vitality comes from people, especially from entrepreneurs, from entrepreneurship.
In the course of 40 years of reform and opening up, there are thousands of stories of entrepreneurs' entrepreneurial innovation, and the growth and expansion of the entrepreneurial group has continuously promoted the breaking of the Chinese economy.
For some time, some people in the society have made some remarks that deny and doubt the private economy.
The so-called "private economy off the market theory" "new public-private partnership theory" and other erroneous statements have caused some entrepreneurs' doubts and concerns.
Recently, some private enterprises have encountered many difficulties and problems in their business development.
For example, changes in the international economic environment have affected some export enterprises; the rapid adjustment of demand structure has brought about transformation and upgrading pressure; some policies are not coordinated with each other, the policy effects are superimposed, or the working methods are simple, resulting in some policies that are originally good. The opposite effect and so on.
All kinds of factors are intertwined, the private economy is in difficulty, some private enterprises are facing difficulties, and entrepreneurs show a lot of anxiety.
In this context, to correct the misunderstanding of understanding, unload the ideological burden of entrepreneurs, let enterprises single-mindedly seek development, the government single-mindedly promote development, related to market confidence and development expectations, has a particularly profound practical significance.
At this symposium, the important thesis of "three unchanged" was once again emphasized: "The status and role of the non-public economy in China's economic and social development have not changed!"
From the in-depth promotion of decentralization and the establishment of a power list system to the creation of a legal environment to protect the legitimate rights and interests of entrepreneurs, to create a market environment of fair competition, and to create an atmosphere of respect for entrepreneurs in the whole society. In recent years, the party Central Committee has paid more attention to entrepreneurs and the system protection is unprecedented.
The symposium is clearly put forward to support the development and expansion of private enterprises in six aspects of policy initiatives, launched a series of practical actions committed to private enterprises "light forward."
All these give great encouragement to the entrepreneur group and give more expectations to the community.
The fog has been opened, the policy has been set, and the key lies in implementation.
It is necessary to continuously create a better development environment for the private economy, help private enterprises solve difficulties in development, and help realize China's economic transformation and upgrading; it is necessary to let entrepreneurs feel fair in market competition, feel safe in legitimate business, feel respect in social life, and stimulate innovative vitality and creative potential.
China's economy has entered the process of high-quality development, which requires more entrepreneurs to display their ambitions, and also provides more space and stage for entrepreneurs to exert their creativity.
We have reason to believe that with further deepening reform and breaking down obstacles, the private economy will usher in better development prospects and development opportunities, and move towards a broader stage.

China-Vietnam border estuary port held national flag-raising ceremony to celebrate National Day
"I can't think of such a majestic and spectacular flag-raising ceremony in the frontier, which is even more shocking than watching the flag-raising in the mainland."
On the morning of the 1st, Mr. Zhang, who came to the Yunnan estuary port on the Sino-Vietnam border from Sichuan, and more than 500 troops, resident people, and Chinese and foreign tourists watched the flag-raising ceremony of the National Gate to celebrate the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
The estuary port is the largest port in the Yunnan section of the Sino-Vietnam border. It is located in Hekou County, Honghe Prefecture, Yunnan Province. It is across the river from the old market in Vietnam and belongs to the national first-class port.
With the deepening of the construction of the national "One Belt, One Road," as one of the most convenient channels for China to connect Southeast Asia, the entry and exit flow of the estuary port has grown steadily.
At 7: 30 in the morning, the sun just revealed a corner. The limited area of the estuary port gathered the local people and Chinese and foreign tourists who came to watch the flag-raising ceremony.
At 0745 hours, the flag-raising ceremony began on time, and the members of the honor guard at the national gate of the estuary border checkpoint were full of energy and escorted the national flag to the flag-raising platform.
After the commander issued the flag-raising instructions, the flag-raiser strove to draw an arc, and the bright five-star red flag stretched like the "eagle wings," and the melody of the national anthem rose slowly.
"In each New Year's Day, Spring Festival, National Day and other time nodes of great significance, the National Day flag-raising ceremony not only shows the image of China, but also stimulates the patriotic feelings of the people of all ethnic groups in the frontier."
The officers and men of the honor guard who participated in the flag-raising ceremony said.
It is reported that the national gate honor guard responsible for the flag-raising ceremony of the estuary port is composed of more than 40 officers and soldiers from various posts at the estuary border checkpoint. From the flag-raising team of 3 people to the honor guard of scale, this team has experienced more than 60 years of history. Since its establishment, it has carried out more than 70 national foreign affairs activities.

Individuals who have no residence in China but live for more than one year and less than five years may only pay personal income tax on the part paid by units or individuals in China.
The part paid abroad does not need to pay personal income tax within China.

During the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, the parties released some positive messages on the Korean Peninsula issue.
South Korean President Moon Jae-yin relayed the "irreversible" nuclear abandonment determination of the DPRK and said that US President Trump and North Korea's supreme leader Kim Jong-un may meet before the end of this year.
The US State Department later said that Secretary of State Pompeo will visit North Korea in October to promote the implementation of the US-DPRK leaders' Singapore meeting commitments.
Since the beginning of this year, the two Koreas have broken the ice to open the road of dialogue, the leaders of the two Koreas and the DPRK and the United States have held meetings, the general trend of easing the situation on the peninsula has continued, and the principle of dialogue to resolve the peninsula issue has been adhered to.
First of all, the "essence of the peninsula issue is a security issue" has not changed. The key to achieving peace on the peninsula is to properly and balance the reasonable security concerns of all parties, rather than blindly pressuring each other and emphasizing their own demands.
Secondly, in the dialogue on realizing the denuclearization of the peninsula, the parties concerned still disagree on the steps and ways to realize the denuclearization of the peninsula. Due to the long-term lack of political trust between the DPRK and the United States, the game thinking of "who is first and who is later" is still strong.
Recently, at the open meeting of the Security Council on the Korean Peninsula held at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, the different voices of the parties on the issue of sanctions against the DPRK once again highlighted the "no change" on the peninsula issue.
US Secretary of State Pompeo insisted that sanctions against North Korea will not be lifted until the Korean Peninsula is completely denuclearized.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov stressed the principle of "responding to action with action," pointing out: "The weakening trend of sanctions should be the same as the steps taken by North Korea on the road of gradually abandoning nuclear weapons."
There is no doubt that all parties concerned should continue to implement the Security Council resolutions related to the DPRK in a comprehensive, complete and accurate manner, but pressure is not the end. The implementation of sanctions and the promotion of political settlement are the requirements of the Security Council resolutions.
As Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, in view of the current positive progress in inter-Korean and DPRK-US relations, China believes that it is necessary for the Security Council to consider timely launching reversible clauses, thus encouraging North Korea and relevant parties to take greater steps toward denuclearization.
Looking back on the past, the denuclearization of the peninsula and every progress in the peace process require all parties to show sufficient political courage.
At present, in the face of the growing expectations of the international community to promote a political solution to the peninsula issue, all parties concerned should show political courage, make political decisions, implement commitments, resolve difficult problems, continue to take steps to meet each other, and promote the denuclearization process of the peninsula and establish a peace mechanism on the peninsula. Work together to create a permanent peace on the peninsula.

At the same time, the Health Bureau considers it necessary to vaccinate other personnel, including the public sector. The Health Bureau will take the initiative to contact the relevant organizations to obtain the list and arrange vaccination by the health center.
In order to facilitate vaccinators and reduce the waiting time for vaccination, the Health Bureau will send medical staff to primary schools, primary schools, kindergartens and nurseries in Hong Kong from October to December this year to conduct group vaccination for children, small and medium-sized students, teachers and employees. In addition, the Health Bureau will also arrange personnel to conduct group vaccination in elderly and disabled homes, public sector or other institutions with large numbers.
Students and young children who fail to participate in the group vaccination can take the Macao Resident Identity Card, the Health Bureau User Card, the Influenza Vaccination Card (if any), the student ID card, the employee ID card or the professional certificate to the Yan Long General Hospital vaccination station or the health center from December 3, 2018.
The Health Bureau reminds residents that between September 2017 and August 2018, people who have received the 2017-2018 influenza vaccine will still need to receive a new season of influenza vaccine from September 2018, because the influenza antigen contained in the 2018-2019 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine has been updated, which is aimed at the seasonal influenza in the Northern Hemisphere 2018-2019 winter and 2019 summer.
The peak period of influenza in Macao generally occurs from January to March of each year, which is later than that in temperate areas (such as northern China and Japan). The Health Bureau calls on the elderly, children, pregnant women, obese people and chronic patients who are more prone to complications after contracting influenza. High-risk people and those who are often exposed to high-risk people should be vaccinated as soon as possible.

More than 400 people have been confirmed dead in a 7.5-magnitude earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday, many of whom were swept away by the tsunami wave caused by the earthquake.
Authorities expect the total number of deaths on Sunday to increase significantly as new data are reported in remote areas.
It is reported that dozens of people are still trapped under the ruins of a hotel and a shopping center in the city of Baru.
Large waves of up to six meters (20 feet) caused by the earthquake hit the city of Baru.
So far only the death toll from Baru, the death toll in Dungra, north of Baru, has been reported slowly, and the authorities are preparing for a worse situation.
Dungra has a population of 300,000, closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Indonesian Vice President Kara said that the total number of deaths may rise to thousands.
When the huge waves hit the coast at dusk on Friday, hundreds of people gathered at the beach to celebrate the festival. Many people were washed away by the huge waves and everything was destroyed wherever the huge waves went.
TOKYO, October 1 (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan's quarterly short-term survey released on Monday showed that the confidence of large Japanese manufacturers in the September quarter hit its lowest level in more than a year, because the rising cost of raw materials and a series of natural disasters affected production, so that companies feel the pressure.
The survey hardly shows that the escalating global trade frictions have hit the confidence of large manufacturers.
But the risk of a full-scale trade war has hit the business prospects of enterprises and may threaten corporate capital expenditure.
Active capital expenditure is a bright spot in the Japanese economy.
The survey raised questions about the Bank of Japan's view that sound economic expansion will help accelerate inflation to reach the 2% target, although there are signs that companies are gradually passing on costs to customers.
"In the face of concerns caused by the global trade war, due to the slowdown in exports and weak factory production, the confidence of manufacturers tends to stagnate," said Nan Wuzhi, chief researcher of the Agricultural and Forestry Institute.
"Confidence is still high. And because corporate profits are improving and prices are rising, I don't think confidence will continue to decline."
According to the short-term survey, the large-scale manufacturing industry sentiment judgment index fell from positive 21 three months ago to positive 19 in September, which was the third consecutive quarter of deterioration.
The median estimate of the market is positive 22.
In September, the large-scale non-manufacturing sentiment judgment index fell from positive 24 in the June survey to positive 22, the first deterioration in eight quarters.
The Reuters survey is positive 22.
According to the survey, the large-scale manufacturing and non-manufacturing industry sentiment judgment index in December is expected to remain stable.
Investors did not care about the decline of the short-term corporate sentiment judgment index. The Japanese Nikkei .N225 rose to a 27-year high on Monday, as the continued depreciation of the yen helped improve the export profit prospects of Japanese companies.
Capital expenditure is stable.
Although business confidence has declined, the latest short view highlights the soundness of corporate capital expenditure plans, thanks to the renewal of production capacity and increased investment in robots and automation to cope with the labor shortage caused by the aging of the population.
The central bank's short-term survey shows that large companies plan to increase capital expenditure by 13.4% in the current fiscal year ending March 2019.
The previous short view survey was 13.6%.
Nan Wuzhi said that the capital expenditure plan of all enterprises in this fiscal year increased by 8.5%, close to the pace of Japan's bubble economy.
"There is still room for further growth in capital spending, given that small businesses have raised their profit forecasts from now on, but this depends largely on the impact of the trade war on business confidence," he said.
The short-term survey shows that the ability of enterprises to pass on costs has increased. The output price index of large enterprises is positive 7, which is the high point in the past ten years. This is an encouraging sign, reflecting the progress of Japan's efforts to combat deflation.
The index measuring the employment status of large enterprises hit negative 23, the most tight level since 1992, highlighting the tightening of the job market.
Benefiting from strong corporate spending, the Japanese economy rebounded in the second quarter from the contraction in January-March this year.
However, the escalation of trade frictions in the summer and the disruption of the supply chain by natural disasters have overshadowed the export-dependent Japanese economic prospects.
If measured in US dollars, the growth rate of service import and export is 16.4%.
The press release of the Ministry of Commerce website quoted the person in charge of the Department of Trade and Industry as saying that the total import and export of emerging services from January to August exceeded 1 trillion yuan, and the growth rate was faster than the overall.
Among them, the total import and export of emerging services was 11,383.9 billion yuan, an increase of 20.9%, which was higher than the overall growth rate of service import and export by 10.4 percentage points, and the proportion of emerging services increased by nearly 3 percentage points.
In terms of service exports, from January to August, service exports continued their rapid growth momentum this year, and the export growth rate was 5.7 percentage points higher than the import growth rate.
Among them, the top three areas of growth are telecommunications computer and information services, personal culture and entertainment services, and insurance services, with growth rates of 61.1%, 38.8% and 26.5% respectively.
The head of the Department of Trade and Industry also pointed out that the proportion of new service imports from January to August has gradually increased.
From January to August, the import of emerging services grew rapidly, accounting for 23.6% of service imports, an increase of 1.6 percentage points over the same period last year.
Among them, the import growth rate of financial services, intellectual property rights, telecommunications computers and information services exceeded 20%, respectively, 47.1%, 23.3% and 23.2%.

Zhuochuang information refined oil analyst Zang Wengang said.
In terms of retail, the current gasoline prices of No. 92 and No. 95 of Beijing PetroChina and Sinopec gas stations are 7.66 yuan / liter and 8.15 yuan / liter respectively.

The 69th International Astronautical Congress Opens in Germany - Zhongxin
Xinhua News Agency, Bremen, Germany, October 1 (Reporter Ren Ke Zhang Yirong) The 69th International Astronautical Congress opened on October 1 at the Bremen Convention and Exhibition Center in Germany. More than 6,300 astronauts, space agencies and business representatives, experts and scholars and young students from all over the world attended.
In a speech delivered at the opening ceremony, Jean-Yves Legal, president of the International Astronautical Federation, said that the global space industry is no longer only a few countries and institutions participating. The number of participants this year has increased significantly compared with the previous session, indicating that more and more institutions and people are joining.
He called on all countries to strengthen cooperation and innovation and jointly promote the development of the space industry.
Zhang Kejian, vice minister of China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and director of the National Space Administration, introduced China's space program when attending the exchange activities, and said that China will expand international cooperation in the space field and contribute to the human space industry.
Representatives of relevant institutions such as China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation and China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, as well as some private enterprises, attended the meeting and demonstrated the latest achievements of China's aerospace, including various launch vehicles, satellites and aerospace science and technology applications.
The International Astronautical Congress has been held annually since 1950 and is the largest event in the world aviation industry.
The five-day conference was jointly organized by the International Astronautical Federation, the International Academy of Astronautics, the Center for Applied Science and Technology and Microgravity Research of Bremen University, and the International Institute of Space Law.
BEIJING, November 5 (Reuters) - The China Foreign Trade Center issued a press release on Sunday, saying that the Canton Fair shows that China's foreign trade situation is still complicated and severe, and 80.6% of enterprises expect that the export situation in 2018 will be better than the previous year or flat.
However, taking into account the external environment in which the cost of comprehensive factors such as domestic raw materials and labor continues to rise and the impact of Sino-US trade frictions increases, exhibitors also believe that the export situation next year is not optimistic.
At the closing press conference of the 124th Canton Fair, Xu Bing, deputy secretary general of the Canton Fair, press spokesman and deputy director of the China Foreign Trade Center, said that the number of overseas buyers and export transactions of the Canton Fair were slightly lower year-on-year.
The current buyers attended the meeting 189,812 people, from 215 countries and regions, down 1.11% year-on-year.
Export transactions amounted to RMB 2,064.94 billion (equivalent to US $29.86 billion), down 1% year-on-year.
From the market point of view, the transaction volume of Japan, ASEAN 10 countries, "BRIC countries" and South Korea increased by 74.4%, 11.4%, 7.2%, 2.5%, and the traditional markets such as the United States, Australia, Canada and the European Union decreased by 30.3%, 8.9%, 7.3%, 0.8%.
From the industry point of view, means of transport, machinery and equipment, construction and decoration materials, electronic consumer goods and information products, and sanitary equipment increased by 24.8%, 21.1%, 20.0%, 15.1%, and 7.6% respectively, textile and clothing, and household appliances decreased by 13.0% and 6.7% respectively.
Xu Bing said that as a barometer and vane of China's foreign trade, the current Canton Fair buyers' participation situation and export transaction data show that China's foreign trade development will still face many uncertain and unstable factors next year.
However, with the deepening of supply-side structural reform, as well as the recent introduction of national and local policies and measures such as "Six Stability," the new momentum of China's foreign trade development is accelerating the accumulation, and the diversification of the enterprise market continues to make new progress. These are important foundations and powerful conditions for foreign trade development.
"Taking into account all factors, it is expected that China's foreign trade import and export will maintain steady growth throughout the year, and the quality and efficiency will be further improved." Xu Bing said.
China's General Administration of Customs announced that exports denominated in US dollars increased by 14.5% year-on-year in September, imports increased by 14.3% year-on-year, and the trade surplus in September was 31.69 billion US dollars. The export growth rate and trade surplus were the highest since February this year.
Despite the escalating trade frictions between China and the United States, China's export performance in September still greatly exceeded expectations. The external demand is strong, and enterprises are rushing to export the RMB exchange rate depreciation before the US tariffs are imposed, or the main supporting factors are also showing the resilience of China's foreign trade to a certain extent. However, the impact of the Sino-US trade war on confidence and the impact on the industrial chain should not be underestimated. Analysts believe that the challenges of China's foreign trade may appear in the fourth quarter or next year.
According to a Reuters survey, US fund managers proposed to increase their cash holdings in September and continue to maintain a cautious position, as the United States and China began the latest round of mutual import tariffs, and the dispute did not show signs of easing.
However, according to the 12 fund managers who participated in this survey, the North American asset allocation increased to the highest since June 2017, while the UK, the euro zone, especially emerging markets, fell.
The global stock allocation accounted for an average of 56.6%, and the bond ratio was 35.5%, basically in line with last month's survey.
The most obvious change is that the cash ratio rose to 5.1%, the highest since December 2014.
A fund manager of a large fund company said, "Some economic data have brought confidence to the market, but the trade war is still the biggest concern, so it is best to be prepared to enter when the market falls back."
But fund managers still prefer stocks in September, especially US stocks, even if US stocks are considered to be on the high side.
Today, in China's open landmark Shanghai, the world's first large-scale national exhibition with the theme of import, the China International Import Expo, officially kicked off in the expectation of all.
An exhibition is like a "window" that allows the world to better understand a city and a country.
Through the "window" of the Expo, people see that they are moving towards a higher level of "open China"; with the help of the "window" of the Expo, they welcome the world and China's mutual benefit and win-win situation of "reform and opening up."
"For a country, opening up is like breaking a cocoon into a butterfly. Although it will experience a temporary pain, it will be replaced by a new life."
General Secretary Xi Jinping's summary of the road to openness points out an important reason for "why China can."
Looking back on the 40 years of reform and opening up, China, which dares to enter the world market, has encountered whirlpools and storms, but it has always faced all risks and challenges with an open attitude, continuously released endogenous power, and continuously improved its competitiveness.
It can be said that China has effectively interpreted the value and significance of openness with its own practical achievements.
Standing at a new historical starting point, holding an import-themed expo is a major decision made by the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core to promote a new round of high-level opening to the outside world. It is a major measure for China to take the initiative to open its market to the world. It is China's practical action to support economic globalization and trade liberalization. It shows the strong and clear will that "China's open door will not be closed, but will only be bigger and bigger."
And the enthusiastic registration of exhibitors from all over the world and the "one difficult to find" is the biggest affirmation and best response to China's development of an open economy in a larger scope, a wider field and a deeper level.
More importantly, the current global economic and trade order has reached a crossroads.
Some countries have built a high wall of trade protectionism and returned to the old path of unilateralism, which has increased the international community's concern about the prospects of free trade and added a lot of uncertainty to the warming world economy.
In this context of the times, the event on the banks of the Huangpu River reflects China's defense of free trade, allowing the world to see open markets and share the future of China's self-confidence and China's commitment.
Walk fast alone, walk far.
China's open mind and embrace of the world have not only effectively promoted its own development, but also brought surging "China opportunities" to all countries and regions in the world.
In recent years, China has advocated and promoted the joint construction of the "One Belt, One Road," initiated the establishment of the AIIB, and established the Silk Road Fund... China has provided a series of international public goods, providing real export markets, development opportunities and jobs, and allowing companies from all over the world to take the "express train" of China's development.
Into the Expo is also such a public product, a global economic and trade cooperation platform.
On this platform, more than 3,000 enterprises in more than 130 countries and regions have taken a new step in the Chinese market with their unique quality products and services.
In addition to national enterprises, there are domestic consumers who really benefit.
By building this "preferably excellent" platform, it provides a multi-channel high-quality supply for consumption upgrading to meet the personalized, diversified and differentiated consumption needs of the people.
With the opening of the door in China, the goods are flowing smoothly, and the footsteps towards a better life will be more solid.
From a more macro point of view, the significance of entering the expo has gone beyond the scope of economy and trade, but focuses on the future, conveying the concept of openness, tolerance, inclusion, balance and win-win, and forming a consensus to jointly meet today's challenges.
The world is good, China can be good; China is good, the world is better.
We look forward to the Expo bringing the world wonderful and complete; we are more eager to move towards a higher level of "open China" and the world to work together to build a glorious future of the community of human destiny.
Foreign media: The United States and Canada reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
[Abstract] The agreement includes Canada's opening of its dairy market to the United States, and the United States temporarily does not impose tariffs on cars produced in Canada.
According to foreign media reports, a Canadian source revealed on the evening of September 30, local time, the United States and Canada have reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
According to reports, the agreement includes Canada's opening of its dairy market to the United States, and the United States temporarily does not impose tariffs on cars produced in Canada.
On the 27th of last month, the United States and Mexico announced a preliminary agreement on updating the North American Free Trade Agreement, but the United States and Canada failed to reach an agreement before the August 31 deadline set by the US side, extending the negotiation period to September 30.
Earlier, a spokesman for Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland said that Canada will only sign a favorable agreement. "The focus is on the substance, not the timetable. We will continue to negotiate and hope to reach an agreement that is in the national interest of Canada."
More than 90% of Brazilian women voters said that the presidential candidates did not consider women's needs.
According to the South American Overseas Chinese News Network, data released by the Brazilian National Geographic Institute (IBGE) recently showed that more than 90% of Brazilian women do not think that presidential candidates consider women's needs.
According to the report, at present, the number of women in Brazil has reached 107 million. If the women of Brazil are gathered to form a country, the population of this country will be ranked 13th in the world, more than twice the population of Spain.
In Brazil, the number of female voters accounts for 52% of the total number of voters, and men account for 48%. Although the proportion of women in the electorate is very high, the proportion of women in the Brazilian Congress is only 10%.
Among the 193 countries in the world, Brazilian women's participation in politics ranks only 154th, higher than that of Arab countries.
After more than 20 years of struggle for rights, Brazilian women still have not succeeded in gaining their due rights.
Natalia Mori, a Brazilian sociologist, points out that this phenomenon exists because of the combination of ancient patrilineal society, racism and capitalist values.
"Politics should be dominated by citizens claiming civil rights, identity, access to public goods, and multiple social groups to form a society. However, Brazilian politics belongs to the monopoly of a certain group, and the majority of the population is not represented."
A previous study conducted by the Brazilian Locomotiva Institute also pointed out that 94% of Brazilian women do not feel that the elected politicians can represent their rights, 90% of Brazilian women do not agree with the decisions made by politicians, and 93% of women do not agree with the current government policy.
"We need to reverse the underrepresentation of women in the parliament. The Brazilian political system is still affected by inequality. So far, there are still serious gender, class and racial discrimination in the Brazilian political field." Natalia Mori said.
Although women's rights are insufficient, most Brazilian women still believe in the power of democracy.
According to the survey, 76% of women believe that they can make a difference in democratic elections, and 72% of women are interested in politics.
In addition, 55% of women believe that democratic politics is the best way to make women suffer less prejudice.

The T2 terminal of Guilin Liangjiang International Airport in Guangxi was officially opened on the 30th.
Zhao Leqin, secretary of the Guilin Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, said that after the opening of the new terminal, it can meet the annual passenger throughput demand of 12 million passengers, and build a new advantage of Guilin's air traffic.

The design of the new terminal building is inspired by the landscape of Guilin. The far view is like a "landscape laurel," and the near view is like the "Longji Terraced Field" and the eaves of the residential buildings in northern Guangxi.
According to the introduction, the new terminal building of Guilin Airport can meet the peak flow of nearly 4,000 people per hour, and the intelligent baggage sorting system, security integration platform, face recognition and other "smart airport" technical means are used to plan a business district covering catering, department stores, tax exemption and leisure entertainment.
Since most of the growth in Europe, Asia and emerging markets is not encouraging, the United States is increasingly becoming the main engine of global economic growth.
A container cargo ship moored in the port in New Jersey, United States, September 23, 2018.
But because the current growth in the United States is due to the time spent on fiscal stimulus such as tax cuts, the country's economy is also closely watched by the outside world.
"As the United States is returning to full employment, it is inevitable that the economy will decline."
He said that the only question is when it will happen. In his view, it may only be pushed back in advance.
Although Barclays is optimistic about the US economic outlook before the end of this year, the bank admits that it is more difficult to predict the farther time.
"In the absence of more sustainable investment growth to boost economic growth potential, the current growth inspired by fiscal policy will not be sustainable," Barclays economists said in a research report.
"At a time when investment growth is lacking, the risk of a hard landing in 2020 will rise," they said.
A series of corporate surveys will roughly show that major economies are in the economic cycle stage at the end of the third quarter.
The eurozone and US manufacturing surveys scheduled to be released next Monday will be watched, and the service industry survey will be released on Wednesday.
But the focus of next week's data will inevitably be the US non-farm employment data to be released next Friday, which will provide clues about whether the tight job market is driving significant wage growth.
Its importance is not only important for the profitability of enterprises and the purchasing power of consumers, but also because the increase in wages or the rise in overall inflation may make US Federal Reserve officials feel uneasy.
"Pay will be highly regarded because it may rise sharply again from the previous month.
The increase in September from the same period of the previous year may not exceed 3%, but we can fully expect to break through next month, "ING economists wrote in a research report.

The "Sunward Red 22" round is mainly used for the regular inspection and maintenance of buoys / submersibles, regular placement, recovery, buoy / submersible emergency placement, recovery, repair and other support work, and has the ability to carry out comprehensive marine survey tasks such as cross-section investigation.
The new ship has a total length of 89 meters, a width of 18 meters, a depth of 7.2 meters, and a range of 10,000 nautical miles.
Wang Weiling, deputy general manager of Wushang Group, said: "Xiangyang Red 22 is the first large-scale buoy operating ship in China, and it is also the only working ship with the ability to lift a 10-meter large buoy, which will further enhance China's large-scale buoy support capability."
It is understood that after the completion of the ship, it will be delivered to the East China Sea Branch of the State Oceanic Administration of China. Chen Wei, Director of the Observation Department of the Marine Early Warning and Monitoring Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China, said that the ship's use will be of great significance for the development of China's offshore ocean observation system and the promotion of global ocean observation.
"This ship also has a large-scale buoy deployment and maintenance operation, and also has a comprehensive marine investigation capability. It is the first comprehensive ship in China that is specifically used for the operation of the mid-ocean buoy and the comprehensive investigation of the ocean.
With such a buoy operating ship, our ocean observation and ocean investigation have a strong weapon in the future. "
QINGDAO, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Affected by the typhoon "Tan Mei," the 2018 International Extreme Sailing Series Qingdao Station "Maze Run Cup," which was scheduled to start on September 30, postponed the first competition day to October 1, and held a pre-match meeting at the Qingdao Olympic Sailing Center. The captain of 12 water-wing two-body sailing teams from 6 countries and regions appeared.
Affected by the typhoon "Tan Mei" sound, the strong wind in the port pool continued, the maximum wind speed was even as high as 24 knots. The sailing signal was postponed from 1 pm on the 30th for nearly 90 minutes, and the wind speed was still not reduced. The referee Anne Mderant announced the cancellation of the first day of the competition and postponed the competition to the afternoon of October 1.
"The strong winds blowing from the shore continue, and the sea conditions are too intense."
"In this case, no one knows when the wind blows to the boat.
Near the city's arena, in terms of current wind conditions, canceling the game is the most sensible choice. "
All the crew members who are ready are still somewhat disappointed.
"The boat is ready to stop, and we are in good shape."
Max Richardson, the helmsman of the Qingdao team, said frankly: "But I know that the rescheduling of the game is the right choice, and I hope that the wind energy is smaller today, and we can show our skills."
Omica Wilkinson, the "Star of Hope" of the New Zealand team at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, said: "The loss of a day makes the game more interesting.
Because the weight of today's game will increase, and there are only two days left.
Everyone will definitely work hard. "
Although the sea breeze is fierce, the helmsman of the French ABM team, Pierre Ives Durand, told his warm past with Qingdao, the venue of the competition: 5 years ago, the international limit sailing series was accidentally injured and the muscles were broken. Thanks to the treatment of the local event medical team, I can still stand on the venue today after 5 years.
It is reported that the International Extreme Sailing Series was founded in 2007. It is a world sailing league with Volvo, the America's Cup, the World Sailing Tour and other events.

Despite the continued turmoil in the global financial market, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said on Monday that the investment income of the Exchange Fund in the third quarter of this year decreased by 97% year-on-year, but it was better than the performance of the previous quarter. Due to the Sino-US trade war, overseas stocks rose and foreign exchange losses narrowed significantly.
According to the latest data of the HKMA, the Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK $1.6 billion in July-September 2018, which was significantly lower than the HK $61.8 billion in the same period last year, but better than the revised HK $100 million in the second quarter of this year.
Chen Delin, president of the HKMA, said in the Legislative Council that at the beginning of the Sino-US trade war, the Hong Kong and emerging market stock indexes ran counter to the US stock index. After the US stock market index peaked in late September and early October, market sentiment began to reverse, as investors gradually realized that the trade war was also detrimental to the United States itself.
"It is a good thing that market sentiment has changed. If the trade war has only one-sided influence, it will not help to solve things."
But he also pointed out that "if the Sino-US trade war is not resolved, financial market volatility will continue to rise."
In the third quarter of this year, the stock investment loss of the Exchange Fund in Hong Kong narrowed by 8% to HK $4.7 billion compared with the previous quarter, while the investment income of overseas stocks increased by 172% to HK $12.8 billion; the foreign exchange loss was HK $16.2 billion, and the bond income was HK $9.7 billion, which decreased by 24% and 31% respectively. Mainly reflects the general increase of the US dollar against major currencies during the quarter and the US interest rate rose by 3% in mid-September.
The Exchange Fund is mainly used to support the Hong Kong dollar.
Hong Kong has implemented the linked exchange rate system of the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar since 1983.
Regarding the current financial situation in Hong Kong, Chen Delin said that the economic and asset market uncertainty has increased and the downside risks have increased, but the Hong Kong financial system is stable, and it is also well defended, and the seismic capacity is abundant.
"Hong Kong's international investment position is abundant. The external net asset value is 1.4 trillion US dollars equivalent to 4 times GDP, which is higher than 2.5 times that of Singapore and 0.6 times that of Japan. It is more than enough to cope with the economic downturn or reversal."
Recently, the Hong Kong dollar interest rate continued to fall and the spread with the US dollar expanded. Chen Delin pointed out that the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate rose by more than 400 basis points on September 21. The market is generally believed to be mainly related to the rise of the Hong Kong dollar interest rate. After that, the Hong Kong dollar has hovered around 7.80-7.84.
However, he believes that with the beginning of the interest rate hike cycle of Hong Kong banks and the normalization of Hong Kong dollar interest rates, the future situation of Hong Kong dollar interest rates below US dollar interest rates will change.
"The trend of Hong Kong dollar interest rates and US dollar interest rates will be more consistent. Everyone must be more careful to manage risks and be prepared to cope with market fluctuations."
As the Hong Kong dollar funds were very abundant, the Hong Kong dollar interest rate fell further. The three-month interest rate fell by 0.9% to 2.08179% on Monday, and the spread with the US dollar expanded from 46 basis points to 51 basis points; the one-month interest rate hit a five-month low, and the spread with the US dollar expanded from 120 basis points to 127 basis points.
From May to mid-September, the spot exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar was close to 7.85 to the US dollar for most of the time.
During the period, due to factors such as the outflow of some funds from the IPO after the completion of the arbitrage activities and large-scale prospectus activities, the weak party exchange guarantee was triggered several times in May and August after it was triggered for the first time in April.
The HKMA buys Hong Kong dollars and sells US dollars at the 7.85 level in accordance with the linked exchange rate system to maintain the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.
The HKMA bought about HK $52.1 billion under the weak exchange guarantee mechanism in May and August.

In response to a reporter's question on the 30th, the relevant person in charge of the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation said that in order to maintain policy stability, the next step will be to consider continuing to make preferential arrangements for overseas people, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
A reporter asked that the newly revised personal income tax law will adjust the judgment standard of China's personal income tax residents from one year to 183 days.

There is no "threshold" of the moon center: quality certification to promote quality.
With the pull of the "two-child economy" and the prosperity of the mother and child market, from the north to the third and fourth tier cities, various grades of monthly clubs have emerged.
At present, the very hot monthly clubhouse meets the consumer demand of the masses. The fees range from tens of thousands of yuan to hundreds of thousands of yuan, but at the same time, it is also in an embarrassing situation. This institution has no threshold so far, and there is still a gap in supervision.
The State Administration of Market Supervision recently launched the 2018 National "Quality Month" series of activities. The reporter came to a five-star month center in Tianjin to visit the mother and child care service certification experience.
The general moon center provides services such as newborn care, nutritious meals, postpartum repair and shaping.
In this month sub-center, the reporter saw that nurses check the breastfeeding of newborns every day, and professional carers provide fine nursing services such as bathing and touching for newborns.

A new mother who lived in the house told reporters that she booked the moon club eight months in advance.
The service items of the Moon Club directly affect the comfort level and physical recovery during the maternal month. Some small-scale Moon Club can only provide some simple moon services, and there are problems such as disinfection and hygiene, easy cross-infection, and single unscientific diet. Hidden dangers.
The person in charge of this month sub-center said that they are the only one of all five-star month sub-centers in Tianjin to obtain B-level service certification.
"Although some customers did not understand the meaning of B-level certification at first, it is important for the long-term development of enterprises to push back the strict standardization of process management through certification, so that customers can benefit."
Pan Lifen, deputy director of the certification department of the State Administration of Market Supervision, said that service certification is a new type of certification system based on customer perception and attention to the satisfaction of organizational quality management and service characteristics. It is an important part of the national quality infrastructure and plays a positive role in enhancing the proportion of quality service supply and enhancing the international competitiveness of Chinese services.
China started in 2004, after more than 10 years of development, the service certification project has experienced a process of gradual development, such as financial service certification, mother and child care service certification, commodity after-sales service certification, e-commerce service certification, health service certification, etc. A number of influential service certification.
According to the statistics of the State Administration of Market Supervision, there are more than 130 service certification institutions in China, more than 2,000 service certification personnel, and nearly 8,000 valid certification certificates.
Pan Lifen said that it is necessary to further guide and promote the development of service certification, gradually expand service certification coverage in health, education, sports, finance, e-commerce and other fields, and promote supply-side reform and quality improvement in the service industry.
Reuters Hong Kong November 5th - Hong Kong property prices fell for two consecutive months after the peak. Chen Delin, president of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, said on Monday that it is time to observe whether the property market has entered a downward cycle. If confirmed, it can be considered to relax the tightening policy of counter-cyclical measures in due course.
Chen Delin also pointed out that if the property price is adjusted back, the first people who will be affected will be those who buy their homes at the peak of the property market. However, it is expected that there will be a sharp drop in property prices during the Asian financial turmoil in 1997, and the public's chances of selling the property are much lower.
When Chen Delin led a number of senior HKMA officials to attend the Legislative Council briefing, he said that if it is confirmed that the property market has entered a downward cycle, it can relax measures in due course.
"But at present, only a few weeks of data have been seen. Relaxation is still said. It still takes more time to see whether the property market has entered a downward cycle."
Since October 2009, the HKMA has launched eight rounds of counter-cyclical measures to significantly tighten the mortgage of various types of properties, including reducing the number of mortgages and requiring mortgage applicants to pass rigorous stress tests to enhance bank risk management and earthquake resistance.
As Hong Kong officially entered the interest rate hike cycle, the Hong Kong private residential property price index peaked for two consecutive months from August to September, and the monthly decline in September expanded to 1.44%.
However, the cumulative increase in the first three quarters of this year still reached 10.2%.
According to the HKMA, the financial situation of households measuring the seismic capacity of Hong Kong to face financial risks is still healthy. In the second quarter of this year, the proportion of households without mortgages in Hong Kong reached 66%, which is higher than the average of 60% in 2009-11. The average number of mortgages approved and the ratio of contributions to income for newly approved mortgages were 47% and 34% respectively, which was significantly improved from 64% and 41% respectively in 2009-11.
However, Chen Delin said that the high seismic capacity does not mean that the residents will not be damaged by the economic downturn, because the property valuation will fall, and those who buy houses at the peak will bear the brunt.
Although the HKMA has tightened banks' lending to mortgage lenders, home buyers can also obtain high mortgage loans through mortgage insurance or mortgage loans provided by developers.
Mr Chan said that at present, together with the mortgage loans provided to developers, the number of borrowers can reach 85-90%. If the property price falls by 10%, there will be negative assets (that is, the market value of the property will fall below the level of the total amount of outstanding mortgage loans).
However, Ruan Guoheng, vice president of the HKMA, pointed out that the authorities estimate that the total amount of mortgages provided by developers is only 2-2.5% of the total amount of bank mortgages, and the proportion is still low.
At the peak of negative assets in Hong Kong in 2003, the number of negative assets exceeded 100,000, accounting for 22% of the supply.
As of the third quarter of this year, Hong Kong recorded zero negative assets for seven consecutive quarters.

SHENZHEN, October 1 (Zheng Xiaohong Xu Dianwei Liu Meng) October 1 is the first day of the "Golden Week" of the National Day in the Mainland, and it is also the last day of the Hong Kong National Day public holiday. Many mainland residents use the holidays to go abroad to play and shop. There are also many Hong Kong residents who come to Shenzhen to return to Hong Kong on the same day. The situation of passenger flow "exploding shed," Luohu, Shenzhen Bay Port opened 22 self-service channels to improve the efficiency of customs clearance, and improve the efficiency of customs clearance.

The ports have always been busy and maintained a good entry and exit order.
It is understood that due to the increase in the number of countries that provide exit visa-free policies for Chinese citizens, the number of passengers who use the National Day holiday to go to Europe and Southeast Asia for holiday shopping continues to increase.
On the morning of the 1st, the exit direction of Luohu, Shenzhen Bay, Huanggang, Futian and other ports ushered in the peak of passenger (car) flow, including Luohu Port passenger flow from 9: 00 in the morning to 11: 00 in the morning, Shenzhen Bay Port passenger (car) flow peak from 6: 30 am to 13: 00 noon.

Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic and difficult disease involving many organs of the whole body. It used to be considered an "incurable disease."
Because its pathogenesis is unknown, diagnosis and treatment is difficult, and there is no effective treatment method.
Recently, Liu Wanli, a researcher at the School of Life Sciences of Tsinghua University, and Li Zhanguo, director of the Rheumatology Immunization Center of Peking University People's Hospital, discovered that human immunoglobulin has a molecular mutation that increases the susceptibility of systemic lupus erythematosus, and this mutation is involved in regulating immune B cells.
In short, the two teams confirmed that an abnormal immune molecule in the human body is an important cause of systemic lupus erythematosus.
According to Sun Xiaolin, one of the authors of the article and the Peking University People's Hospital, the Li Zhanguo team collected nearly 2,000 large samples of systemic lupus erythematosus patients and conducted research. It was found that patients with immunoglobulin variation produced pathogenic cells and a wide range of autoantibodies, and the incidence and severity of inflammation such as nephritis, arthritis, serous inflammation and vasculitis increased significantly.
Liu Wanli team through the immune cell tracer, animal tests, sequencing and other research methods, found that this immune molecular mutation activated the immune signal pathway, promoting B cells to secrete a variety of autoantibodies pathogenic mechanism.
The reporter learned that the two teams are strong and strong, giving full play to their respective advantages, and realizing the close integration of basic research and clinical application.
Liu Wanli team is committed to B lymphocyte immune recognition and immune activation research, while Li Zhanguo team has long been engaged in clinical research on systemic lupus erythematosus.
"This study is one of the results of many years of cooperation between the two teams. It is also the first time that the academic community has realized that immunoglobulin gene abnormalities will induce systemic lupus erythematosus, which has laid a solid foundation for further academic research and clinical targeted treatment."
This is not to protect the short, but to act according to law.
The lawyer carries an axe to court?
The news was really exciting at first glance, and it also exploded in the legal circle.
Quanzhou City, Fujian Zhongfa subsequently fined the lawyers involved 500 yuan, and suggested in writing that Quanzhou City Bar Association investigate and deal with it.
According to the Beijing News, a few days ago, the Quanzhou City Law Association issued a formal notice saying that the behavior of the two lawyers does not involve illegal violations and is not punished according to law.
From many reports, Quanzhou City Law Association's treatment is not to protect the short or engage in confrontation, but has been recognized by Quanzhou Intermediate People's Court.
An incident that might have caused tension within the legal community was finally properly resolved.
The reversal of the matter stems from a more complete restoration of the truth: the axe carried by the lawyer involved is the same style and the same model as the defendant's murder weapon, but it has not been opened. It is only used as auxiliary evidence in the evidence cross-examination link, and there is no subjective intention to intimidate or "endanger the safety of the court."
Judging whether the behavior of the lawyers involved is illegal and illegal, there are four very important details that need to be paid attention to: First, the local court has only presented the axe photos twice before the court session. From the perspective of defense, it is necessary to show the original axe; second, the axe is purchased only one hour before the court session, not the lawyer does not want to seek the judge's consent, but objectively failed to contact the judge; third, the entire axe has not been used or improperly.
Combined with these circumstances, it can be seen that the lawyers involved "appear in court with axes" have nothing to do with evil, just to defend.
After clarifying the whole fact, Quanzhou City Law Association did not push the boat, but resisted the pressure to make a decision not to punish.
And this decision, also can withstand the test of facts and laws.
As for bringing the axe as a controlled knife to the court without the permission of the court, it is really easy to cause uneasiness and misunderstanding.
Due to safety and caution, Quanzhou Intermediate People's Court's previous fines and judicial recommendations are also understandable.
In order to maintain the dignity of lawyers and prevent individual courts from making it difficult for lawyers, the Supreme Law issued the "Rules for the Safety Inspection of the Judicial Police of the People's Court" in 2014, establishing the principle that lawyers do not need to conduct personal safety inspections when they appear in court.
Since the release of the rule, the majority of lawyers have led by example, and there are few incidents that endanger the safety of the court due to security loopholes.
In a very few cases like Quanzhou, as long as the spirit of mutual respect and understanding is communicated, misunderstanding is not difficult to eliminate.
As a self-regulatory organization of the lawyer industry, the Bar Association undertakes the dual mission of punishing illegal and safeguarding legal.
In the past, individual law associations have been criticized for focusing on punishment and losing their protection.
The decision of Quanzhou Law Association, both in terms of process and results, is commendable and sets an example for more law associations to perform their duties correctly.
From October 1st, which tax benefits will affect our purse?
Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 1 (Reporter Sang Wei) The new personal income tax law will be implemented on January 1, 2019. In order to allow the broad masses of the people to enjoy the tax reduction dividends as soon as possible, from October 1st, the actual income of taxpayers will be deducted according to the threshold of 5,000 yuan per month, and the new tax rate table will be applied.
With the landing of the New Deal, what benefits will affect the purse strings of the masses?
Good one: The tax reduction of wages and salaries is obvious
Taxpayers who obtain wages and salaries after October 1 can deduct the basic deduction cost of 5,000 yuan / month and apply the new tax rate scale. Most taxpayers have different degrees of tax reduction, especially the tax reduction for middle and low income earners is more obvious.
According to the tax reduction table of different income groups, the monthly income after deducting the "three risks and one gold" is 8000 yuan, 10000 yuan, 20000 yuan, and 50000 yuan. The tax payable after the tax reform is 90 yuan, 290 yuan, 1590 yuan, 9090 yuan, compared with the monthly threshold of 3500 yuan, the corresponding tax reduction ratio is 73.9%, 61.1%, 49.8%, 18.8%.
It is worth noting that due to holiday reasons, the wages that should be paid in October by various units at the end of September may be applied to the new basic deduction fee and tax rate.
To this end, the withholding client software used by the tax department has provided the corresponding tax calculation function, but the corresponding tax still needs to be declared and paid during the statutory declaration period.
Good 2: Low tax rate range is significantly enlarged
In addition to raising the threshold, the new tax rate will be applied from October 1st.
The seven-grade tax rate of this salary and salary income is the same as before, and there is no change, but the tax rate has changed significantly. The 3%, 10%, and 20% of the three-grade low tax rate has expanded significantly, and the 25% tax rate has narrowed, while the 30%, 35%, and 45% of the three higher tax rates remain unchanged.
It is worth noting that the tax law has also adjusted the tax rates of various grades of production and operation income, and the lower limit of the most high-end 35% tax rate has been raised from 100,000 yuan to 500,000 yuan.
This means that individual industrial and commercial households and sole proprietorship partnerships will benefit from tax reform.
"From the early calculation of individual tax cuts for Shanghai taxpayers, the majority of taxpayers will fully feel the dividends of tax reform, especially for low- and middle-income people."
Lan Min, head of the personal income tax department of the Shanghai Municipal Taxation Bureau of the State Administration of Taxation, said.
Good 3: Tax service is more convenient and optimized
Since the publication of the new personal income tax law, the Shanghai tax department has carried out a series of comprehensive and extensive tax publicity actions.
On the one hand, the key tax sources, key enterprises to carry out "one-to-one, point-to-point" policy guidance.
Pudong New Area Taxation Bureau has visited Apple Trade (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., Alipay (China) Network Technology Co., Ltd., Red Star Macalline Home Group Co., Ltd. and other large enterprises. These enterprises have a large number of employees, a large amount of withholding work, a large amount of tax payment, and the tax department has taken the initiative to guide and answer questions; Xuhui District Taxation Bureau visited the large-scale labor enterprises in the region, such as Zhongzhi Financial Consulting Co., Ltd., Zhongzhi Shanghai Economic and Technical Cooperation Company, etc., etc., timely collect business concerns, respond to solve problems, etc.
On the other hand, for the general public taxpayers, carry out "all-round, multi-dimensional, three-dimensional" tax policy push.
The use of Shanghai tax official website, WeChat public number, microblogging and other channels to push policy hotspots in a timely manner to ensure that policy publicity is in place.
At the same time, from September 28th, the Shanghai Tax WeChat public number went online 12366 intelligent consultation platform, and through the "artificial + intelligent" tax service consultation, carried out the "targeted" intelligent integration tax reform publicity service.

According to foreign media reports, the joint statement of Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland and US Trade Representative Letterschitzer published on the Canadian government website said that the United States, Canada and Mexico reached a tripartite trade agreement, which will be known as the "USMCA" (US-Mexico agreement).

The Okinawa Governor's election, which was held in advance due to the death of former Governor Weng Changxiongzhi, was announced in the early morning of the 1st local time, and Yucheng Danny, who opposed the relocation plan of the US military base in Japan, was successfully elected.
The election was counted on September 30. The final results showed that Yucheng received a total of 396.632 million votes, the most votes in the history of the Okinawa Prefectural Governor's election, more than 80,000 votes than its main rival, Zuoxi Zhenchun.
A total of four candidates participated in the election, with a turnout of 63.24%, down by 0.89 percentage points from the 2014 Okinawa Prefectural Governor Election.
Yucheng said to the media on the 1st that the election results showed that the county people did not want to let Governor Weng's efforts in vain. He will inherit the legacy of Governor Weng and continue to oppose the relocation plan of the US military base and the closure of the Futenma base. Efforts to the Japanese government and the US government.
The US military base in Futenma is located in Yinowan City, Okinawa Prefecture. It has been criticized. The Japanese and US governments have previously agreed to relocate it to the border area of Nago City, but the Okinawa people strongly oppose it and hope to completely move the base out of Okinawa.
And for the relocation plan that the county people strongly oppose and the request to revoke the land reclamation permit along the ancient coast of the border, Yucheng said that he did not stand in opposition and division with the central government at the beginning. I hope that the two sides can fully exchange views and show the intention of resolving through consultation.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also told the media on the morning of the 1st that he seriously accepted this result and will make efforts to revitalize Okinawa and reduce the burden of the base.
Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Kan said at a press conference on the 1st that the government's policy on relocating the US military base as soon as possible has not changed.
At the same time, he also expressed his intention to talk with Yucheng.
Yucheng will officially take office as governor of Okinawa Prefecture on the 4th of this month.
Since the mid-2000s, as China's demand for oilseeds has grown, Paul Thomas, a North Dakota farmer, has grown more and more soybeans in his field.
This transition peaked this year, and he planted 1,600 acres of soybeans in 5,000 acres, reaching an unprecedented scale.
But Thomas and many farmers like him plan to switch to the staple crops of the former American agricultural areas in 2019: corn and wheat.
American farmers have grown more soybeans this year than corn for the first time in 35 years.
The reason why other food crops are planned is because American farmers are facing difficulties in selling soybeans in the context of US President Trump's trade war with China.
China usually buys about 60% of US-exported soybeans, but because of the trade war, it has purchased almost zero US soybeans in recent months, causing soybean prices to fall to a ten-year low.
Thomas plans to grow more wheat next year, hoping to earn more by reducing his dependence on crops that depend on Chinese demand.
Thomas said that the price of soybeans "has brought us a painful blow."
He said that without China's purchase needs, the spot price of soybeans near his farm is $7.10 per bushel, while the price necessary to cover the cost is $8.50.
US farmers have set a record high in soybean planting area this year, and the harvest is also expected to set a record high.
At such a time when it is easy to be hit, they have encountered the blow of trade war.
In response to Trump's tariff on imports of Chinese goods, China imposed import tariffs on imports of US soybeans in July.
The US Department of Agriculture will release the first estimated report on the planting area next year, which is expected to include consideration of the impact of tariffs.
The estimate is expected to confirm the expectations of private institutions that the sown area of soybeans will be reduced.
According to a report seen by Reuters, Informa Economics predicted on October 19th that the corn planting area will increase by 4% to 92.7 million acres (37.5 million hectares) in 2019, and the soybean planting area will decrease by 7% to 83 million acres.
Informa also expects the US wheat planting area to increase by 4%.
The area of soybeans planted before the implementation of retaliatory tariffs rose to 89.6 million acres this year, about 15 million acres higher than 10 years ago.
The corn planting area has increased by less than 5 million acres since 2008 to 89.1 million acres. This year, the wheat planting area is 47.8 million acres, close to the lowest level in 100 years.
Aron Carlson, president of the Illinois Corn Planting Association, has a total planting area of 3,600 acres. Nearly half of his planting area this year is used to grow soybeans, but he plans to reduce it in the future.
He said that he may increase the corn planting area by up to 20% at his farm in northern Illinois; the state is the largest soybean planting state in the United States.
Soybeans produce less per acre than corn, but require less fertilizer, which makes soybeans generally less expensive to grow.
If farmers transfer to the final value of corn, it may increase costs, but it will benefit some companies including Andersons Inc fertilizer sellers.
Andersons CEO Pat Bowe told Reuters that he expects that the conversion of corn will be conducive to fertilizer use.
Bayer also expects to benefit from farmers switching to corn.
Surtirava, director of the Langman Airport Authority in Bangkok, Thailand, held a press conference on the 29th to apologize for the incident of a Chinese citizen being beaten at the airport, and said that Thailand welcomes Chinese tourists. The relevant departments will strengthen management, improve service awareness, and avoid similar incidents.
According to reports, on the 27th, the security guard of Langman Airport had a physical conflict with a Chinese man who was refused entry.
Sutirava said that the act of the security guard involved was a serious violation of discipline. The Airport Authority has suspended him and set up an investigation committee to investigate the matter. If the matter is true, the security guard will be dismissed.
At present, the Thai Immigration Bureau has arranged for the man to return to China by plane.
Sutirava expressed regret for this incident that damaged the image of Thailand, and said that the Thai side attaches great importance to this matter, is willing to try to reduce the impact of the incident on the beaten tourists, and will issue a letter of apology to the parties through the Chinese Embassy in Thailand.
He said that Langman Airport is willing to provide convenience for Chinese tourists to Thailand, and jointly with the Thai Immigration Bureau in Bangkok Suvarnabhumi, Langman, Chiang Mai, Phuket, Hat Yai and other five major international airports in Thailand to set up special channels for Chinese tourists.
He said that in the next step, the Airport Authority will rectify the landing area, express the landing fee, and improve the service quality and communication ability of the staff.
After the Chinese Embassy in Thailand learned of the incident, it first contacted the parties to understand what happened.
At the same time, the Thai Immigration Bureau, the Airport Administration, and the Ministry of Tourism and Sports made representations to the Thai side to thoroughly investigate the incident and severely punish the perpetrators, and will continue to maintain close communication with the Thai side, properly handle the matter, and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the parties.
Xinhua International Review: Defending multilateralism, China's knowledge and practice.
At a time when unilateralism is surging against the current, international rules and multilateral order are affected.
To some extent, the confrontation between unilateralism and multilateralism has entered a critical period.
As a responsible power, China has worked with the international community to safeguard multilateralism and promote multilateralism.
In the face of the new situation and new challenges, China has issued a loud voice on the development direction and path of multilateralism.
As State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in his speech at the general debate of the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, multilateralism in the new era should adhere to the goal of win-win cooperation, based on rules and order, based on fairness and justice, and guided by effective action.
At the same time, China calls for the construction of a global development cooperation pattern with the United Nations as the core, North-South cooperation as the main channel, and South-South cooperation as the supplement, and calls on all parties to work together to build a community of human destiny.
China's thinking and voice reflect the mainstream voice of the international community.
As Espinosa, president of the 73rd session of the General Assembly, said, under the current situation, "the United Nations needs to promote multilateralism and maintain a rules-based international system."
IMF Managing Director Lagarde said that the international community should continue to firmly safeguard the multilateral trading system, adhere to international trade rules, and resolve differences through consultation.
In recent years, with the adjustment of the global economic and political balance of power, some emerging markets and developing countries have risen to play a greater role in the major international multilateral mechanisms, providing new development impetus for multilateralism that encounters headwinds.
Standing in this dimension, the construction of the big family advocated by China is not a small circle, adhere to the concept of multilateralism such as co-construction rather than win-win eating, and adapt to the trend of the times. It is an inevitable choice to meet global challenges and solve world problems, representing the common demands of most countries in the world.
There are advanced concepts, more solid action.
China's "One Belt, One Road" initiative has become the largest international cooperation platform.
China's international and regional cooperation initiatives such as the "One Belt, One Road," the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and the "16 + 1 Cooperation" promote international and regional cooperation, improve and supplement the existing international system and order, bring innovative vitality to multilateral cooperation, and contribute to the development of the international order in a more just and reasonable direction.
As a defender of the international order and a practitioner of multilateralism, China's actions are becoming more and more powerful in the multilateral arena of the United Nations.
We will mediate international hotspots, address climate change, participate in peacekeeping operations, vigorously reduce poverty and help other countries implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
As UN Secretary General Guterres said, China has become an important pillar of multilateralism.
When the "trust deficit" facing the world intensifies, and when the trend of populism and polarization rises, it is the world's most urgent need for multilateral cooperation.
At such a historical juncture, the international community needs to join hands, turn consensus into action, resolutely defend multilateralism, and jointly promote the construction of a community of human destiny.

The fifth "Disabled Voice Month" comes to pay attention to the sexual education of disabled teenagers - Zhongxin.com
In recent years, the topic of sex education for young people in China has been widely discussed, but the challenge for sex education for young people with disabilities is still very difficult.
Recently, a seminar on comprehensive sexuality education challenges and practical strategies for people with disabilities was held in Beijing.
How to educate disabled children and young people about sex has become an important topic in this seminar.
The "Report on Sexual Knowledge, Attitudes and Behavior of Disabled Children and Youth in China" released at the meeting shows that the proportion of disabled children suffering from sexual harassment and sexual assault is higher than that of healthy children.
For disabled children and teenagers, the society gives more attention to "sexual protection."
The purpose of this seminar is to discuss the promotion of comprehensive education for disabled children and young people in China from the three aspects of family support, school education and institutional services, and to provide support for disabled children and young people from the source, so that they can enjoy the right to love like others.
Experts believe that all along, the Chinese public's understanding of the disabled groups has remained at a level that is not deep enough.
Affected by traditional concepts and other factors, China's comprehensive education for people with disabilities, especially disabled children and young people, is not deep enough.
However, in recent years, with the support of UNESCO and public welfare people, the practice and realization path of sexual and reproductive health education for all-round development of people with disabilities in China has achieved gratifying development.
The "Report" shows that children and young people with visual impairment, hearing impairment, intellectual impairment and physical impairment will have more difficulties in acquiring sexual knowledge and understanding of intimate relationships than ordinary people, but on the whole, they have developed to convenience and richness.
The "Seminar on Challenges and Practical Strategies for Comprehensive Education for Persons with Disabilities" was hosted by the Shanghai People's Public Welfare Foundation. The UNESCO Representative Office in China, the Beijing Representative Office of the International Disability Alliance (France), and the representative office of the United Nations Population Fund in China jointly supported it. In the context of the strategy of healthy China, we will jointly discuss the practice and realization of sexual and reproductive health education for all-round development of persons with disabilities, and promote policy makers, educators, researchers, social service organizations, parents, and representatives, etc.
BEIJING, September 30 (Reuters) - China's central bank announced the net short-term outflow of foreign currency assets on Sunday. As of the end of August this year, the short position of the central bank's foreign currency against local currency forward contracts and futures contracts was zero for 12 consecutive months, and there was still no long position in the month.
The central bank's previous data showed that as of the end of August last year, the central bank held a short position of foreign currency against local currency forward contracts and futures contracts of 6.044 billion US dollars, which was the fourth consecutive month; the short position in SDR (special drawing rights) was 4.276 billion SDR.
Since then, the central bank's foreign exchange forward short position has been zero.
The central bank first released the data at the end of March 2016; the data showed that at the end of February 2016, the central bank's foreign currency position against local currency forward contracts and futures contracts was 2.438 billion US dollars, and the short position was 28.9 billion US dollars.
The September data released at the end of October of the same year showed a net short increase of 16.401 billion US dollars to 45.301 billion US dollars for the first time.
The central bank has previously said that the forward and futures short positions of foreign currencies against local currencies mainly reflect the foreign exchange forward operations carried out by the central bank with commercial banks to meet the hedging needs of corporate foreign currency liabilities. It will continue to provide long-term safe-haven products according to the principle of real demand. The impact of the central bank's long-term operation on the future foreign exchange reserve scale is small.
On the evening of September 20 this year, on the K158 train, Joe, a junior in Zhengzhou, went to Hebi by car.
A big man on the train bought a seat-free ticket, but occupied her seat: "Take it."
Two hours by car, the conductor advised him that an hour was still invalid.
In the end, a male passenger in the same car could not see the big man.
From the point of view of public opinion, although most of the final results are that the overlords are condemned by the public, punished by the public security department, and even included in the integrity blacklist, the public still feels that they do not "hate": Why can't the overlords be punished on the spot?
Why can't you stop its immoral or even illegal behavior on the spot, but can you punish it afterwards?
And for the unreasonable behavior of the "bully," how is it just a male passenger who "sees the road" and pulls it up?
The main reason for this is that only long-distance trains are equipped with police, and short-distance trains are generally not; even if there are police, the police are also worried about the possible rogue reaction of the overlord and did not take forced removal measures.
Repeated incidents of hegemony have made people realize that the bully must be forcibly removed or even punished on the spot to play a deterrent role.
This requires that our train passengers should dare to take strong measures in time. Trains that do not have police should be equipped with police as soon as possible to prevent and crack down on illegal activities in a timely manner.
On October 1st, the first day of the National Day holiday, the vehicles from Beichuan Qiang Autonomous County in Sichuan to Songpan in Maoxian County soared.
At 13 o'clock, the Beichuan traffic police received a call for help, saying that his family had a traffic accident in Songpan. Due to the limited local medical conditions, it is urgently needed to be sent to Mianyang for treatment.
Just in time for Beichuan Tangjiashan Yan Sehu Huanhu Road to implement one-way traffic control, I would like to ask the traffic police to release 120 emergency vehicles.
After receiving the call for help, the police on duty quickly reported the situation to the brigade. After the captain Huang Xuemin simply understood the situation, he immediately arranged for the police on duty to contact the caller and asked to do a good job in the escort work.
"At that time, there were more than 1,000 vehicles entering the controlled section. After contacting 120 emergency vehicles, it is expected to arrive in Beichuan at about 15: 00. We immediately arranged for deployment."
Beichuan traffic police Yuli squadron leader Wei Wei introduced that emergency vehicles need to detour from the Tangjiashan Yan Sehu Huanhu Road, and the road is steep and narrow. In order to prevent the vehicles that have entered the road from driving in parallel, the traffic police implemented a section control on the vehicles at the beginning, middle and end of the road one hour in advance, and reminded all the drivers who passed to open the road.
Subsequently, the police of the drum squadron also temporarily stopped the vehicle to enter the control section, queuing up to let the 120 emergency vehicles that are about to arrive.
At about 15: 00, a Sichuan U license ambulance entered Beichuan territory. The Beichuan traffic police sent a police car to open the road and escorted the emergency vehicles all the way into the control section.
It is understood that some places around the lake road can only pass by a car. The police temporarily controlled these places in advance to ensure the smooth passage of 120 emergency vehicles.
Arriving at Shilibei Village in Huiping Township, there was a section of the road that could not be mistakenly allowed, so the traffic police contacted the village committee in advance, borrowed the village road to bypass, and prohibited social vehicles from entering.
"It took only 40 minutes for the Beichuan traffic police to receive 120 emergency vehicles and drive into the normal road of 302 provincial highways."
Wei Wei said that according to the normal situation, the entire passage time takes 4 hours.
"This arrangement has successfully won valuable treatment time for patients."
It is reported that at 17: 20, critically ill patients were sent to Mianyang in time for treatment.

Earlier, Indonesian President Joko Widodo had surveyed the disaster area and called on the people to be patient.
Reuters on November 4th - The British Daily Telegraph reported on Sunday that the Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab privately asked the UK to leave the Irish border after three months to "guarantee" the right to arrange.
According to the report, Rab made this request to Irish Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Simon Coveney at a private meeting in London last Tuesday.
The report pointed out that this request is "obviously contradictory" with the statement made by David Lidington, the British cabinet office minister, when he visited Dublin three days later.
The Brexit Department said it would not comment on private meetings.
At 8: 05 yesterday morning, two pickpocketing suspects were arrested when they were pickpocketing from the No. 20 bus Yongdingmen Station to Zhushikou Station.
Two pickpocketing men cut the passenger's coat pocket and stole the 800 yuan in cash, so that the police who had already crouched in the side could catch it.
This is the first case of shoplifting uncovered by the Beijing police during the National Day.
Yesterday morning more than 5 o'clock, the Beijing Public Security Mobile Investigation Corps anti-pawn investigators arrived at the scheduled position.
According to past experience, places where the flow of people is concentrated, public transport hubs, bus subway lines, including Tiananmen Square to watch the flag-raising crowd, are the key areas of their work.
In the flow of people, plainclothes police officers calmly observed the passing crowd.
At 7 o'clock in the morning, the investigators who were crouching at the bus stop found two suspicious men with a male passenger standing on the No. 20 bus from Yongdingmen.
In the car, two suspicious men left and right, the male passengers caught in the middle, one of them tried to cover the other.
However, they did not know that their every move had already fallen in the eyes of the plainclothes police who observed it.
"Catch the thief and catch the stolen goods," the plainclothes police arrested people to pay attention to the fire. In the process of waiting for the man to start the theft, the police stared at the man who was preparing for shoplifting, and they were arrested by the investigators after their shoplifting.
Beijing Morning Post reporter saw that the police seized 800 yuan in cash from the theft suspect.
"They took the money from the passenger's pocket."
The police pointed to a broken coat pocket and said: "They cut it open and stole 800 yuan from a passenger who came to Beijing. When we caught them, the money was just put into their own pockets."
The reporter learned that in order to catch these two people, the plainclothes police followed for an hour, and finally caught them in one fell swoop when they committed the crime.
The two suspects are currently under police review.
The undercover police told reporters that who is suspicious in the crowd, this problem is very simple for the police.
"When you catch a thief, you will find that their eyes, looks and ordinary passengers are different. In addition to staring at people's pockets and backpacks, they also like to drill into the crowd, rather than hide from people."
The police also told reporters that suspects and other cars often have no purpose. They like to wander in the station and find the object of pickpocketing before they will follow the car.
"These are all empirical talks. The undercover clothes have been dry for a long time, and they naturally know it."
In addition, the police also suggested that "it is most convenient to put things in the outer pocket, and it is also most likely to be stolen."
During the ride, you should pay attention to your own property to prevent theft.

British Prime Minister Theresa May called on her party to unite to support her Brexit plan on Sunday, directly calling on critics to support it, saying that the free trade agreement they want is the core of her Brexit plan.
British Prime Minister Theresa May travels to attend the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, England, September 30, 2018.
At the beginning of the Conservative Party's exciting annual conference, Theresa May's plan was once again attacked by two former cabinet ministers, including former Foreign Secretary Johnson, who called Theresa May's plan "chaotic."
But she also received strong support from other pro-Brexit ministers, who "praised Theresa May as one of the most polite people," and International Trade Secretary Fox and Foreign Secretary Hunter also pointed their anger at the EU.
Theresa May's already fragile leadership came under further pressure this month, as the EU rejected parts of the so-called "Chequers" plan.
But Theresa May viewed the consultations positively, saying she was ready to consider the EU's misgivings.
"My message to my own party is that let us work together to find the best deal for the UK," said Theresa May.
Former British Foreign Secretary Johnson called Theresa May's plan "messy" and attacked her for not having confidence in Brexit.
He and former Brexit Secretary Davis are pushing for a Canadian-style free trade agreement with the EU.
Theresa May said that this proposal will enable Northern Ireland to implement different tariff regulations, which is similar to the division of Northern Ireland from the United Kingdom.

To activate rural consumption, we must rely on the normalized mechanism to purify the market, guide healthy consumption demand, and enhance the sense of access to farmers' consumption.
According to the data, the consumption potential of rural residents continued to be released. In the first half of this year, the retail sales of rural consumer goods increased by 10.5%, which was 1.3 percentage points higher than that of cities and towns.
Visiting a poor village in a western county, there is only one convenience store in the village, and some goods are familiar with the store. "Goldfish" is marked as "Golden Dragon Oil," and "Wangzi" has become "Wangzi," "Shanzhai" has many goods.
Over the years, similar phenomena have frequently been exposed. Some rural fake and shoddy goods are famous brands, with similar names, similar packaging, and fake and true, which is too much to prevent.
A consumer survey report released by a city in the west shows that the problem of fake goods in rural areas is serious. 66% of users have bought fake goods in the township offline supermarkets, of which food accounts for more than half.
The relevant departments regulate the rural market, shouting and fighting every year, why is "Li Ghost" still playing?
Unlike the urban market, the awareness of farmers' rights protection is relatively weak. In addition, many rural locations are remote and are in blind areas that cannot be reached by regulatory forces, so that fake and shoddy commodities have a breeding ground.
A commodity bulls tube, some departments manage the price, some manage the production, some manage the market, cross functions, annual anti-counterfeiting, centralized management of a gust of wind, fake goods escape the limelight, and slowly come out, just finished the old fake, new fake and come out.
The lack of long-term supervision mechanism, the rural market is difficult to purify, the illegal cost is low, and the benefits are large, resulting in some illegal traders using the "going up and down the country" mentality, and some rural areas have become "waste markets."
From food and clothing to a well-off society, the majority of farmers are moving towards development-oriented consumption.
Recently, the Party Central Committee and the State Council issued "Several Opinions on Perfecting the Mechanism of Promoting the Consumption System to Further Stimulate the Consumption Potential of Residents," which proposed to promote the upgrading of rural residents' consumption ladder, with the aim of allowing the majority of farmers to "consume" "willing to consume" and "dare to consume," so that rural consumption can really flourish.
On the one hand, it is necessary to deepen reform, eliminate the drawbacks of market supervision and management, adapt to local conditions, improve the food safety and product quality supervision network, and constantly compress the space for rural counterfeiting and selling.
On the other hand, it is necessary to increase law enforcement and open up supervision "capillaries," and must not allow fake and shoddy to breed and spread in rural areas.
Severe punishment of potholes is to protect farmers. No matter how hidden the counterfeiters are, they should not become a reason for the breeding of fake and shoddy commodities. The relevant departments should clarify their duties, the grassroots supervision force sinks, and which link is wrong, it is necessary to be held responsible, so that counterfeiters and sellers have nowhere to hide.
Strict market access, the implementation of strict qualification examination for producers and operators, the market circulation, so that products come to the road, go to the road clear, from the source, the root to find a way, so that legal dealers feel at ease to operate, so that farmers can buy at ease.
To activate rural consumption, we must guide healthy consumption demand.
With the upgrading of consumption, many farmers not only pursue eating and eating well, but also pursue high-quality life such as culture and health. They cannot follow the rural market with "low quality" and "cheap" paintings.
This needs to promote the extension of e-commerce to the vast rural areas, unblock the two-way linkage sales channels between urban and rural areas, promote the integration of offline industrial development platforms and online e-commerce trading platforms, and support the expansion of new consumer formats to rural markets; promote the organic combination of commercial logistics and leisure agriculture, rural tourism, product processing, etc.; improve the rural modern circulation network system, optimize the integration of stock facilities, and effectively reduce the cost of rural circulation.
For the countryside to create a clear, assured market environment, so that farmers do not worry about consumption, rural consumption can become more and more prosperous, in order to enhance the sense of acquisition and happiness of farmers' consumption.
From November 1st, China will reduce the MFN tax rate for some commodities, and the total tariff level will be reduced to 7.5%.
According to the decision of the 26th executive meeting of the State Council, the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council issued a notice on the 30th, and from November 1, 2018, the MFN tax rate of some commodities will be reduced.
According to the "Notice of the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council on Reducing the Import Tariff of Some Commodities," in order to adapt to industrial upgrading, reduce enterprise costs and meet the needs of the masses for multi-level consumption, from November 1 this year, the MFN tax rate for some industrial products and other commodities will be reduced.
There are 1,585 tax items for tax reduction commodities, accounting for about 19% of the total number of tax items in China. The average tax rate dropped from 10.5% to 7.8%, and the average decline was 26%.
This tax reduction mainly involves textiles; stone, ceramics, glass products; some steel and base metal products; mechanical and electrical equipment and parts, such as metal processing machinery, textile machinery, construction machinery, transmission and transformation equipment, electrical equipment, instrumentation, etc.; resource commodities and primary processing products, such as non-metal mines, inorganic chemicals, wood and paper products, precious jade, etc.
At the same time, with the reduction of the total tariff level, especially the import tariffs on medicines and consumer goods, the tax rate of import duties on imported goods will be lowered accordingly.
In order to implement the decision and deployment of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, China has implemented zero tariffs on the vast majority of imported drugs since May 1 this year. From July 1, the import tariffs on automobiles and parts and some consumer goods have been reduced, and the information technology agreement has been implemented. The third step of expanding products is to reduce taxes.
The reporter learned from the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council that since the beginning of this year, after continuous independent adjustments, China's total tariff level will drop from 9.8% in the previous year to 7.5%, with an average decline of 23%.
The appropriate reduction of tariffs is conducive to promoting the balanced development of foreign trade and promoting a higher level of opening up to the outside world. It is also conducive to the overall use of international and domestic resources and promoting domestic supply-side structural reforms.
The relevant person in charge of the committee said that this year is the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up. The initiative to reduce the overall level of tariffs is a practical action to implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the Boao Forum for Asia. It is also an important measure for China to further expand opening up and actively expand imports in accordance with its own high-quality development needs. This action and initiative show that China will unswervingly pursue a mutually beneficial and win-win opening strategy, while enhancing its own development momentum, it also allows China to better benefit the world.
On September 29th, the regional public brand conference of "Huanxiang People" agricultural products in Huanxian County, Gansu Province was held in Nankai District of Tianjin.
Red Army Xiaomi, black beans, mountain children's songs black goats, hardcover bitter tea, paper-cut shadow books, pure handmade slippers... A piece of beautifully packaged agricultural products is neatly placed on the booth. They have a common brand name called "Huanxiang People."
"Building the regional brand of" Huanxiang People "has effectively solved the bottleneck of the development of Huanxian's agricultural products, which is scattered, small and weak, and has become a powerful carrier for poverty alleviation." On the 29th, the "Huanxiang People" agricultural products regional public brand conference was held in Nankai District, Tianjin.
Huanxian is located at the junction of the three provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu and Ningxia. As a "national grain production advanced county," "China's small grain town" and "China's shadow town," it has a long history and abundant resources.
Lamb meat, yellow rice wine, chop noodles, swallow noodles soft and other local snacks are often remembered by tourists in other countries.
With the continuous improvement of China's urbanization level and the rapid increase of urban population, a large number of rural young people leave their hometown to start urban life.
Yang Qiaojia, an expert in China's agricultural brand research, said: "Now urban life is fast and stressful. More and more people are beginning to miss the rural life as a child. However, the most beautiful memory is the countryside. The brand design is named after the nostalgia and nostalgia of the people who are drifting around the county."
Huanxian has special climatic conditions, long sunshine time, large temperature difference between day and night, and unique planting conditions for small grains.
The territory is rich in more than 20 kinds of small grains. It is the hometown of small grains in China. The output ranks first in Gansu, and the quality is in the forefront of the country.
Wang Xiaoli is a Huanxian girl who went to school in Tianjin. This time, she participated in the promotion meeting as a volunteer. She said: "The people in the hometown are the most close, the taste of the hometown is the most beautiful, and the brand of" Huanxiang People "evokes too much nostalgia and memories. It is the food of the time, I hope that the" Huanxiang People "brand will go further and further and further and bigger."
Dr. Tan Bin, a researcher at the Scientific Research Institute of the National Food and Material Reserve Bureau, said that through the detection of more than 900 sets of indicators, the testing data of buckwheat, bitter, black beans and other agricultural products in Huanxian County are outstanding, and the content of many physiological active substances in miscellaneous grains is higher than the standard data. "Huanxiang people" has the inherent advantage of grabbing the domestic high-end grain market.
Chai Chun, secretary of the county party committee of Huanxian County, said that through the release of the "Huanxiang People" brand, it can further enhance the quality, standardization and large-scale innovation and development level of Huanxian high-quality agricultural products, which is conducive to shaping the overall image of Huanxian's agricultural products and rapidly enhancing visibility, competitiveness and added value.
Canada's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 0.2% in July compared with the previous month, which was higher than expected, causing the market to expect the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates next month.
If it does raise interest rates, this will be the fifth time that the central bank has raised interest rates in a little more than a year.
Analysts interviewed by Reuters had previously estimated an increase of 0.1%.
Statistics Canada said Friday that 12 of the 20 industries achieved growth.
The reason why the data is noteworthy is that the central bank predicted earlier this month that temporary factors may drag down the third-quarter GDP data.
Bank of Canada President Poloz promised Thursday that the central bank will continue to raise interest rates gradually and will pay close attention to economic data.
The Bank of Canada's next interest rate decision will be announced on October 24.
As the Canadian economy strengthens and the unemployment rate is close to a record low, the Bank of Canada has raised interest rates four times since July 2017.
Stephen Brown, a senior Canadian economist at Kaitou Macro, said that the GDP growth rate of the country's economy in the third quarter is expected to reach about 2%.
"This will be higher than the 1.5% expected by the Bank of Canada, which will be another reason for the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates next month," he said in a report.
Overnight index swaps showed that the market's estimate of the Bank of Canada's interest rate hike in October rose from 76.46% to 78.27%.
The first joint inspection of the Han River in 65 years
South korea\ 's defense ministry confirmed on the 5th that the two Koreas launched a joint inspection of the waters at the mouth of the hanjiang and linjinjiang rivers on the same day.
The initiative is a preliminary preparation for ensuring the free navigation of private vessels on both sides.
South korea\ 's defense ministry provided to the media on the same day, this is the first time since the signing of the korean war armistice agreement in 1953, the two sides conducted a joint inspection of the hanjiang estuary.
The ROK and the DPRK signed a military agreement in September this year, and agreed to jointly inspect the waters such as the mouth of the Han River in November to ensure environmental protection and tourism in the future.
In October, the ROK and the DPRK planned a joint inspection of the waters during the general level meeting.
On November 5, the joint inspection of inter-Korean waters was officially launched.
The joint delegation was composed of 20 members, including the Korean military and experts.
According to the South Korean Defense Ministry, during the inspection, personnel from both sides did not carry weapons and prohibited the use of words and deeds that stimulated each other.
"Because there is no military demarcation line near the mouth of the sea, the area has been an unexpected high-incidence area, but through joint inspection, it will become a new peaceful area in the future."
The waters jointly inspected by the ROK and the DPRK have a total length of about 70 kilometers and a total area of about 280 square kilometers.
South korea\ 's defense ministry said that the south korean side will send six research vessels to detect the depth of seawater, etc., to provide basic information for the safe navigation of the waters; after the completion of the investigation, it will provide navigation maps for private vessels.

It is understood that the two are members of the blue sky rescue team. On October 19th, the two contacted domestic friends and relatives, saying that they would immediately enter the mountains near Kusugur Lake and share the location through WeChat. Since then, they have lost contact and suspected that they have gone to no-man's land.
The Chinese Embassy in Mongolia has always attached great importance to the protection of the legitimate rights and interests and security of Chinese citizens in Mongolia, and attaches great importance to consular protection and assistance.

The local police and emergency departments have overcome huge difficulties, almost all police forces have been mobilized, and local herdsmen have been mobilized to carry out carpet search and rescue through horse riding, walking, visiting herdsmen, etc.
At the same time, in view of the special situation of pastoral areas, the Mongolian side has been publishing notices through the broadcast cycle for many days.
Domestic blue sky rescue team related staff have also come to Mongolia and Mongolia to actively participate in the rescue.
The safety of the two disconnected personnel has always touched our hearts.
So far, the two have been disconnected for more than ten days, and the embassy has received some clues, but they have not found two people. At present, the search and rescue operation is still under intense.
The Embassy will always follow the principle of "people-oriented," continue to pay attention to this matter, promote the Mongolian side to continue to search and rescue, and provide maximum assistance to the families of the parties.
The Embassy appeals to compatriots and enterprises in Mongolia. If you know the relevant clues, please contact the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia for the first time.
