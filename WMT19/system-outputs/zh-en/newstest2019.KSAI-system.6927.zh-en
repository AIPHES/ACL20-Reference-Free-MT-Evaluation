According to British media, U.S. Vice Admiral William Moran said that even as the U.S. Navy is re-energizing to deal with an increasingly worrisome Russia on both sides of the Atlantic, the U.S. continues to make the Asia-Pacific region - which the Pentagon has expanded to include the Indo-Asia-Pacific - the focus of the Navy.
According to a report on the website of Britain's Jane's Defence Weekly on September 24, the United States listed China and Russia as strategic competitors in the new national defense strategy published at the beginning of the year.
Since then, the U.S. Navy has restored the Second Fleet in order to confront Russian activities more directly.
According to the report, these moves have raised some questions and concerns among allies and analysts, who fear that the US Navy may move away from the "Asia-Pacific rebalancing" strategy that marked the Obama administration.
But Admiral Moran says the focus of the U.S. Navy remains the Western Pacific.
"There have been no major changes for us," he said on January 24, 2018, at a roundtable discussion entitled "Meeting the High Seas Challenge" hosted by the US National Bureau of Asian Studies in Washington.
"The focus is still on rebalancing, the shift of focus or whatever you want to describe it," Moran said.
He acknowledged, however, that the United States has close relations with Europe.
"We will continue to focus on the growth of the West Coast and balance what we can do," he said.
While Moran pointed out that the overall policy on Russia falls within the purview of the US Secretary of Defense, he warned: "The Russians may face demographic and economic challenges, but history has proven that if we clash with them, they will be very tough."
Admiral Moran said the U.S. Navy is dynamically deploying its troops into a "new mode of operations" as part of a renewed U.S. operation against Russia, China and other competitors, which will help to catch rivals off guard as to where U.S. aircraft carrier groups or other assets will be deployed at any given time and place.
"We in the Navy and Marine Corps support it - the concept of operational unpredictability, don't be in the same place again and again, almost like clockwork - it's our approach," he said.
According to the report, the first to try this new approach was the "Harry Truman" aircraft carrier battle group, whose early deployment included working visits to the port and patrolling in areas that are usually only passed through.
Moran said the U.S. Navy is now working to ensure allies know that the ships will still patrol the traditional areas, and is also addressing logistical and family liaison issues for the new deployment procedures.
The head of the Royal Australian Navy, Lieutenant General Michael Noonan, also spoke at the event, saying that the Australian military could work seamlessly with the US aircraft carrier strike group.
He said the situation will continue as the Royal Australian Navy plans to procure nine more frigates equipped with Aegis combat systems.
From October 5, a number of airlines have raised or restored fuel surcharges. From next Friday, aircraft travel will be more expensive
Yesterday, Xiangpeng Airlines, Okai Airlines and other airlines announced that, with effect from October 5, 2018 (the date of issue), the fuel surcharge for domestic routes will be RMB20 per passenger on routes up to 800 km (including) and RMB30 per passenger on routes over 800 km.
Xiangpeng Airlines, Okai Airlines and other companies announced that from October 5, 2018, at the zero point (date of issue), the fuel surcharge rate for domestic routes under 800 km (including) will be increased from RMB10 per person to RMB20 per person, and the fuel surcharge rate for domestic routes over 800 km will be increased from RMB10 per person to RMB30 per person.
Children and military police are all 10 yuan per person. Infants continue to be exempted from collection.
According to the person in charge of the Ctrip ticket, the airline has indicated in the notice that the fuel surcharge will be charged according to the original date of issue. When the passenger ticket is exchanged, the fuel surcharge will not be refunded.
This means that domestic airline tickets issued before October 5 will not have to pay the fuel surcharge according to the new standard if they are to be changed to October 5 (inclusive).
Since June 5, 2018, a number of airlines, including Air China, Eastern Airlines, HNA, Shanghai Airlines, Spring and Autumn Airlines, Shenzhen Airlines, Western Airlines and Okai Airlines, have resumed charging domestic fuel surcharges, which have been cancelled for three years, with a standard of 10 yuan per person.
This time, Xiangpeng Airlines and Okai Airlines took the lead in announcing the increase of fuel surcharge. As of the press release, they have not seen the news of the follow-up adjustment announced by the four major domestic airlines.
It is also understood that the Hong Kong Civil Aviation Department has stipulated that airlines can decide whether to charge fuel surcharges on their own from November.
Cathay Pacific announced at the earliest on September 27 that it would re-charge the fuel surcharge from November 2.
According to the Cathay Pacific website, all tickets issued or re-issued by Cathay Pacific and Cathay Dragon on or after November 2 will include a fuel surcharge of $652 for long-haul flights to and from Hong Kong and the South-West Pacific, North America, Europe, the Middle East and India, and Africa, and $146 for short-haul flights.
The fee is applicable to all ticket types, calculated according to each flight segment, and includes the ticket price of all direct sales channels in Cathay.

Japan's Itochu Commercial on Friday recognized a $1.3 billion impairment loss on its investment in China's CITIC shares, taking a writedown on its largest corporate investment deal because of the impact of trade tensions between China and the United States.
In May 2016, in Tokyo, Japan, a man walked past the headquarters of Maru Hong Corporation.
Maru Hong said that the trade war hit its U.S. grain division, Gao Hong, and that it had suspended financial transactions in agriculture.
Some Japanese heavy equipment manufacturers, telecommunications companies and others have warned of the impact of Sino-U.S. trade frictions when they released their latest results, and now these Japanese trading houses have also joined the ranks.
The United States and China have imposed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of each other's goods. U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to extend the levy to all over $500 billion of Chinese goods exported to the United States if the dispute cannot be resolved.
The impact of trade disputes on China's economy is likely to be greater next year, according to Tsuyoshi Hachimura, Itochu's commercial finance chief.
Itochu Commercial and Thailand's Boho Group invested $10 billion in CITIC in 2015, acquiring a 20% stake in it.
According to Hachimura, Itozhong Commercial filed a 143.3 billion yen (US $1.3 billion) loss on the stake because it believed that Citic shares would not recover in the near future.
Itochu maintains its profit forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019 at 500 billion yen.
China imposed a 25% import tariff on U.S. soybeans in July to counter Washington's move in trade frictions.
"Our cereal business has been hit by U.S.-China trade frictions," said Yanhong Yabe, Maru Hong's finance chief.
He said that Gao Hong has stopped financial transactions in his own account since September.
Gaohong spokesman Pat Burke said in a statement Friday that the company's move was "subject to internal policy restrictions and due to lack of market opportunities."
He also said that the suspension of financial transactions will not lead to the loss of jobs.
Maru Hong maintained its annual profit forecast of 230 billion yen unchanged, helped by pulp and paper and power generation business.
Sumitomo on Thursday reported a 16% increase in profits between April and September, stressing that "the future is uncertain due to the trade issues between the United States and China."
Mitsubishi raised its annual profit forecast to a record level on Friday, attributed to higher coking coal production and higher prices for commodities such as oil and coal.
Mitsubishi also announced a new business plan, aiming to increase its profit to 900 billion yen (US $7.98 billion) in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022, from 640 billion yen estimated this year.
On November 5, CNN reported comprehensively that the U.S. mid-term election vote has entered the countdown.
On November 4, President Donald Trump and his Democratic opponent actively "urged" their core voters.
Both major parties have pointed out that voter turnout will be the key to shaping the election situation.
It was reported that in the 48 hours before the US popular vote, Trump was busy attending the Republican candidate's build-up, while former President Barack Obama went to Indiana to stand for the embattled Democratic federal Senate candidate, Joe Donnelly, and called out the final pre-election appeal to the crowd.
On November 4, Trump went to Maygang, Georgia, to stand for Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp, saying, "You have to go to the polling station on Tuesday, you have to vote."
"The contrast in this election couldn't be clearer."
The political enthusiasm of voters rose to a rare peak, and early voting in some states has been far more than usual.
Successive U.S. presidents face their first midterm elections, and his party's congressional seats tend to shrink.
According to a new poll released by The Washington Post and ABC News on Thursday, Republicans can benefit from the economic assessment and Trump's strict focus on border security, although the Democratic Party's federal House race is still strong.
Polls show that registered voters prefer Democratic House candidates over Republicans, 50% to 43%, but still down from a 14-point lead in August.
Another poll conducted by NBC and the Wall Street Journal also showed that Democrats still lead Republicans by 7 percentage points.
"When people don't tell the truth, when words no longer represent anything, there's bound to be consequences," Obama is said to have told the crowd at Senator Donnoli's build-up.
Democracy doesn't work when people can only lie to themselves. "
"The only way to stop the behavior of these Republicans right now is you and your vote."
Democrats face the most difficult election in decades in the Senate, where Republicans now hold more than half the 51 seats.
But the House race is more favorable, with Democrats needing to win another 23 seats to take control of the 435-seat House.
Analysts at FiveThirtyEight.com, a forecasting website, have estimated that Democrats are up to 85% likely to win the House.

A total of 793,800 CPPCC members at all levels and 279,000 government officials participated in the study and discussion, resulting in more than 36,000 research papers.
People's Network Beijing, November 5 (Wang Xiaoyan) Under the current wave of "mass entrepreneurship, mass innovation ", more and more technology companies are beginning to attach importance to patent research and development and related protection work, dig deep into the potential value of patents, and occupy market dominance.
Similarly, there are also a number of technology enterprises in patent technology licensing, the use of patented technology and other aspects have encountered a significant wave of infringement.
At the end of 2017, three people from Guangdong Province, Tan Wei, He Zhanghong and Lai Bin, on the grounds of patent infringement, filed a lawsuit against the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court against the developer of "Drop Trip" APP, Beijing Small Orange Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Little Orange Technology), the operator Drop Trip Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Drop Trip), and the seller, Guangdong Pacific Internet Information Service Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Guangdong Pacific).
The three plaintiffs requested a court order, and the three defendants immediately stopped manufacturing, selling, promising to sell, and using the plaintiff's patent.
On October 30, 2018, the China Judicial Documents Network published "the first-instance civil ruling of the dispute between Tan Wei, He Zhanghong and Beijing Xiaoqiang Technology Co., Ltd. on infringement of patent rights for inventions ", disclosing the details of some of the cases in which DDT travel APP was sued for patent infringement.
The three plaintiffs believe that the patent holder and inventor of the patent for “carpooling service system and method based on mobile terminals ”, and that the entire operation process of“ ride-hailing ” application in “Drop Trip ” APP corresponds to the technical scheme of patent protection involved in the case, constituting patent infringement.
However, during the court ruling, Xiao Orange Science and Technology held that Guangdong Pacific was not a suitable defendant. It only provided free downloads of the APP "drip travel" involved in the case on the Internet. It did not implement the patent method involved. There was no direct or indirect infringement and should not be listed as a defendant in the case.
Secondly, the place of tort in this case is not in Guangdong.
According to the law, the place of infringement of the patent involved should be the place for the complete implementation of the patent method involved. Therefore, the jurisdiction of the court was challenged, and the case was requested to be transferred to the court of the defendant's place of residence, namely, the Beijing Intellectual Property Court.
The Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court held that the defendant, Guangdong Pacific, provided the alleged infringing DDT travel APP products on its online platform, and that it was not inappropriate for the plaintiff to list the defendant, Guangdong Pacific, as the defendant.
And the defendant's Guangdong Pacific domicile is located in Guangzhou, which is under the jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The defendant, Xiao Orange Science and Technology, argued that the case should be transferred to the Beijing Intellectual Property Court for trial. On the basis of insufficient evidence, the defendant, Xiao Orange Science and Technology Co., Ltd., rejected the objection to the jurisdiction of the case, and bear the expenses for accepting the case of jurisdiction objection.
At present, the other trials of the case have not been announced. Journalists will also pay close attention to the follow-up details of the patent infringement case of DDT travel.
Interview with the Chief Executive Officer of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization of Australia: Remarkable achievements in Australia-China scientific and technological cooperation
"China's science and technology has developed rapidly in the past few decades. Australia and China can achieve fruitful results by working together in the field of science."
Larry Marshall, chief executive of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization of Australia, said in a recent interview with the China News Agency in Beijing that the cooperation between Australia and China in the field of science and technology, from the fight against climate change to the cooperation of the "Eye in the Sky" project, has shown great vitality.
As the largest national scientific research institution in the Commonwealth of Australia, CSIRO has achieved many innovative research results in the fields of ocean, energy, biology, materials, astronomy and other fields that have attracted worldwide attention.
CSIRO has always maintained close cooperation with scientific research institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
"This is a lasting friendship that embraces trust in partners and a tradition of long-term cooperation," Marshall said.
In May this year, China's 500-meter-caliber spherical radio telescope, the "China SkyEye ", installed the first 19-beam L-band receiver in the world.
This 19-beam feeder receiver, currently the most advanced in the world, is jointly developed by Chinese and Australian scientists.
Marshall said that the successful development of the receiver is based on the accumulated technology of CSIRO for many years. After the launch, the speed of the FAST survey will be increased by five to six times. At the same time, more scientific observation targets will be expanded.
"It's a contribution of CSIRO to FAST."
In addition to the above-mentioned cooperation, CSIRO also has close cooperation with Chinese scientific research institutions in the construction of a square kilometer array radio telescope, the development of new fuel technologies, energy conservation and emission reduction.
"In the past, scientific research has tended to focus on the problems of the past 100 years, and now more scientific research is needed to solve the problems in front of us."
Marshall believes that Australia and China are complementary in the field of scientific development, while both countries face a series of challenges in their development.
For example, extreme weather frequently occurs around the world. Droughts and floods have led to a reduction in food production. Food shortages have seriously affected the development of mankind.
At the same time, the population explosion, aging, chronic diseases and other issues are also serious challenges currently faced.
"The cooperation between Australia and China in recent years is mainly focused on solving these current problems."
Marshall said that the work of the International Southern Hemisphere Ocean Research Center, jointly established by CSIRO and the Qingdao National Laboratory of Marine Science and Technology, is focused on observing the El Niño and La Niña phenomena, studying the relationship between the two and extreme weather, and establishing early warning facilities for extreme weather. The new grain varieties developed by CSIRO and the Chinese Academy of Sciences to overcome extreme weather can also alleviate the food shortage caused by extreme weather.
"In the current environment, scientific and technological innovation is difficult to accomplish on its own, requires extremely high costs, and there are many problems to be solved. Therefore, cooperation is particularly important in today's world."
Marshall said that the closer the cooperation, the more likely it will be to make breakthrough progress. This is also the significance of strengthening cooperation between Australia and China under the framework of "Belt and Road ".
"To strengthen bilateral cooperation, it is mainly cooperation in science and technology for us."
Marshall said, for example, that CSIRO has recently developed a gold purification method that does not use cyanide. Because the traditional cyanide gold purification method is very harmful to the environment, many countries hope to find a gold purification method with little environmental pollution.
"We are very willing to introduce this technology to China, which is one of the results of our participation in the" Belt and Road "cooperation."

North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued imposition of sanctions is deepening North Korea's distrust of the United States, and that North Korea cannot give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea has taken a "very friendly approach" in the past year, including stopping missile and nuclear tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we did not see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"If we don't trust the United States, we have no confidence in our national security. Under such circumstances, we cannot give up weapons unilaterally first."
Although Ri Yong Ho is repeating North Korea's complaint against the United States' opposition to "phased" denuclearization, his speech is significant because it does not completely reject unilateral denuclearization, as North Korea has done before.
Ri Yong Ho referred to the joint statement of Kim Jong Un and Trump on June 12, when Kim Jong Un agreed to work toward the "denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula" and Trump promised to protect the security of North Korea.
North Korea has been seeking to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the U.S. says North Korea must give up its nuclear weapons first.
The United States also refused to relax its demand for international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insisted on'denuclearization first' and stepped up sanctions pressure to achieve its goals in a high-handed manner, even refusing to issue a'declaration on the end of the war'," Li Yonghao said.
"The idea that sanctions can make us beg for mercy on our knees is that people who don't know us are daydreaming.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are deepening our distrust. "
Li Yonghao did not mention the plan of the second special gold meeting mentioned by the President of the United States at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, he highlighted the three meetings between Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in in the past five months and said: "If the other side of denuclearisation is South Korea and not North Korea, then denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula will not become so deadlocked."
China announced that, with effect from November 1, 2018, the import tariffs of 1,585 tax items will be reduced.
Since this year, China has successively taken the initiative to reduce its import tariffs.
On May 1 this year, the drug tax was cut across the board, and the import tariffs of all general drugs, including anti-cancer drugs, alkaloids with anti-cancer effects, and Chinese patent medicines with actual imports were adjusted to zero for a total of 28 items.
At the same time, the tax burden of value-added tax on the production and import of anti-cancer drugs has been significantly reduced.
On July 1, the tax on automobiles and parts for 218 tax items was reduced.
After the tax reduction, China ’ s automobile vehicle tax rate has fallen below the average level of developing countries, and is in line with the reality of China ’ s automobile industry.
This tax cut will promote the structural adjustment of the industry and the optimal allocation of resources, accelerate the survival of the fittest, and help improve the quality of products and services. It is expected to promote the adjustment of automobile prices to a certain extent, so that consumers will get more benefits.
On July 1, the daily consumption goods for 1,449 tax items were reduced.
The reduction of taxes on consumer goods for daily use is closely linked to the people's needs for a better life.
This tax reduction is not only large in number but also strong, with an average tax reduction of 56%.
The reduction of taxes on consumer goods for daily use directly benefits the vast number of consumers and promotes the competitiveness of domestic industries.
On November 1, a tax reduction will be implemented on 1,585 items of machinery and electrical equipment, spare parts and raw materials and other industrial products.
Appropriately reducing import tariffs on some of the industrial goods that are urgently needed in China will attract more foreign investment, help increase effective domestic supply and help upgrade industries. At the same time, it will help enterprises allocate resources on a global scale, reduce production costs, and also help reduce the pressure on the domestic environment.
The relevant person-in-charge of the Office of the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council of China said that the above four autonomous tax reductions, as well as the third step of the tax reduction implemented on July 1 this year in accordance with the outcome of the negotiations on the expansion of the scope of the information technology agreement, will reduce the total tariff level of China to 7.5%, down from 9.8% the previous year.
The adjusted total tariff level is slightly higher than that of the EU, lower than that of most developing countries, and is at a medium low level, basically matching China's status as a developing country and the stage of development.
The person in charge introduced that the total tariff level, as one of the important indicators of China's openness in the field of trade in goods, should be compatible with the stage of China's economic development and reflect the characteristics of the times.
China's goods trade is the largest in the world. It already has the economic basis for further expansion and opening up. However, the quality and benefits of trade development are still far from those of developed economies. Therefore, the overall level of tariffs should be appropriately reduced.
Tariffs are a means of protection for compliance. The level of tariffs should be commensurate with the competitiveness of industry. It is necessary to encourage healthy competition. Excessive protection is not conducive to the development of industry and the improvement of quality.
The adjustment of tariff rate should take into account production needs and consumption needs.
We will focus on reducing the commodity tax rate, which is relatively high in domestic demand and is conducive to the transformation and upgrading of industries. We will strive to increase the import of products with characteristic advantages where the needs of the people are relatively concentrated. We will constantly enhance the sense of acquisition of enterprises and the public, and meet the upgrading needs of the industrial structure and consumption structure.
The strength of tax reduction should take into account both fiscal revenue and the affordability of industrial development.
In the selection of specific tax-reducing commodities and the range of tax reduction, we should coordinate the relationship between domestic and foreign markets, upstream and downstream, production and consumption, and maintain the momentum of steady and positive development of China's economy.
The person in charge stressed that this year marks the 40th anniversary of the reform and opening up, and that China's initiative to reduce the total level of import tariffs is a major measure in accordance with China's own need to achieve high-quality development. It is conducive to making overall use of both international and foreign resources, promoting the improvement of the quality of the domestic supply system, and meeting the needs of the people to upgrade their consumption.
This action and initiative shows that China will unswervingly pursue a mutually beneficial and win-win strategy of opening up, firmly support economic globalization, firmly uphold the principle of free trade and the multilateral trading system with the WTO at its core, continue to draw development momentum from opening up to the world, and also make China's development better benefit the world.
Serbia declares a state of maximum readiness The President of Serbia and Russia will meet tomorrow to discuss the situation in Kosovo
President Vucic of Serbia ordered the country's armed forces to enter a state of maximum readiness in view of the occupation by the Kosovo Special Forces of the channel of the water storage lake of the Gazivoda Hydropower Station, which is controlled by Belgrade, in the north of Kosovo, Nantong news agency quoted the Serbian President's office as saying.
On September 29, the Minister of Defense of Serbia, Vulin, declared that the Serbian army has entered a state of full readiness.
Wulin stressed that as long as the order issued by Vucic is still valid, Serbia will continue to monitor the current situation in Kosovo, and the Serbian army will respond regardless of the direction of events.
According to Russian news agency Tass, on September 29, Vucic said in an interview that he had briefed the US, Russia, Europe and other parties on the current situation, and would travel to Moscow on October 2 to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin and seek Putin's support on the Kosovo issue.
When asked if Serbia needs Russian military support like Syria, Vucic gave a negative response: "I don't want a major military conflict on our territory."
Vučić also said that the entry of the Serbian army into full combat readiness is only intended to form a deterrent to prevent the conflict, but it is also a clear warning that no violence will be tolerated in Kosovo.
The reason why the Serbian army has increased its operational readiness is related to the two major moves of the Kosovo side.
According to the Serbian side, in recent days, Albanians are aggressively arresting ethnic Serbs who have lived there for generations in the northern part of Kosovo, and these arrested Serbs have not broken any laws.
Vucic said that since March 26 of this year, when the head of the Serbian government's office in Kosovo and Metohija, Marko Juric, was beaten and detained by the Kosovo Albanian Army, the situation in the region has escalated and the Serbs have been subjected to inhuman arrest and deportation.
In addition, more than 100 people, including the ROSU special forces, armed police and snipers of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Kosovo, who recently announced their own establishment, occupied positions near the water storage lake of the Gazivoda Hydropower Station, entered the ecological and sports center near the dam in the northern part of the Kosovo area, and blocked all nearby roads, which were originally controlled by the Serbian side.
Vučić pointed out that this military adventure in Kosovo was made at the instigation of the Western countries. The move of the Kosovo army did not inform the Serbian side in advance, in violation of Chapter 9, paragraph 1, of the Brussels Agreement, as well as the UN Security Council Resolution 1244 and the military technical agreement between Secco.
Vucic has already called out NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg, criticizing Western countries for their hypocritical rhetoric on Kosovo.
The root of the current conflict is still the centuries-old historical feud between the two communities in Kosovo.
With regard to the attribution of Kosovo, the Serbs and Albanians have their own versions.
Serbia regards Kosovo as the birthplace of the nation and the cradle of culture, because Serbia established its strongest state here in the 12th century, and ethnic Albanians only moved in in large numbers after the invasion of the Ottoman Empire and the defeat of the Serbian army to the north.
Albanians, for their part, insist that the Illyrians, the original tribe who lived in Kosovo in the 4-5th century BC, are the ancestors of the Albanians, so Kosovo has been an Albanian territory since ancient times.
Subjective political divisions have resulted in fierce conflicts among different ethnic groups, religions and cultures, resulting in fierce antagonism between Serbs and Albanians in the Kosovo region.
In 1912, the Kosovo Albanians first declared the independence of Albania.
After the First World War, a large number of ethnic Albanians living in the Balkans moved to Turkey, and the proportion of Serbs rose relatively. In the view of the Serbs, the practice of "just taking back their own land" was plundered by the Albanians as "Greater Serbianism ", and the conflict between the two communities intensified.
Kosovo became the "powder keg" of the Balkans.
In 1999, the armed conflict between the Albanian separatists in the Kosovo Liberation Army and the Serbian army and police led to the bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which is composed of Serbia and Montenegro, by NATO troops, and the outbreak of the Kosovo war.
On 17 February 2008, Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia.
Since then, despite the news that Serbia will normalize relations with Kosovo and sign a global and legally binding agreement, due to historical ethnic animosities and geopolitical constraints, the agreement, which is subject to many forces, including the United States, Europe and Russia, was not signed.
And just a month ago, Vucic made it clear for the first time that he wanted to separate the Serbs from the Albanians in Kosovo, once again making the contradictions between the two communities public.
Power communications continue to be disrupted in Indonesia's strong earthquake and tsunami relief difficulties
According to figures released by the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency in the early hours of the morning of the 30th, the strong earthquake and tsunami that occurred on the 28th in Dungara County, Sulawesi Province of the country, have killed 420 people.
Wilem Rambangilei, the head of Indonesia's disaster relief agency, said the figure was only a preliminary tally for the city of Palu, the capital of Central Sulawesi province, about 80 kilometers from the epicenter. Many of the city's hotels, shopping malls, warehouses and other crowded buildings damaged by the earthquake have yet to be searched because of the lack of large-scale search and rescue machinery.
On September 29, 2018, local time, a bridge damaged by the earthquake and tsunami collapsed and broke into several sections in Balu, Indonesia.
Due to the serious damage to power and communication facilities, Dongara County, the epicenter of the quake, and the neighboring Xiji area are still "isolated islands" that cannot be linked. It is impossible to count the number of victims.
At this time, the media reported that Indonesia's Vice President Kara said the death toll may reach thousands.
Power outages, communications outages, road disruption, airport damage... The rescue work after the strong earthquake and tsunami is difficult.
Due to power outages, some hospitals and rescue settlements in the city of Palu have to rely on fuel to generate electricity.
Roads in and out of the city have been blocked by landslides, and large transport vehicles, including tankers, have been unable to enter, making the fuel supply very tight.
Indonesian Social Minister Agus said that because of the road damage, the tents, mattresses, blankets, clothes, food, household goods and other emergency relief materials transported by the Ministry from the neighboring provinces of South Sulawesi and Gorontalo have not yet arrived in the disaster area.
Disaster relief materials transferred from the capital Jakarta are being transported to the disaster area by air force transport aircraft.
In view of the damage to the control tower and runway of Palu Airport in the earthquake, in order to ensure safety and security of rescue, all commercial flights have been suspended, and only military aircraft carrying relief supplies and personnel have been allowed to take off and land.
Indonesia's Minister of Political, Legal and Security Affairs, who directed the rescue in the earthquake area, Wiranto, requested that the power supply and commercial flight services of the airport be restored as soon as possible to ensure the operation of the hospital and other rescue agencies, so that more rescue workers, volunteers and aid materials can reach the disaster area.
On the 28th, a series of strong earthquakes occurred in Dungara County, Central Sulawesi Province, Indonesia. Among them, a strong 7.7-magnitude earthquake at 17:02 local time triggered a tsunami, causing major disasters in Palu City, Dungara County and Xiji District.
China News Agency, Beijing, October 1 (reporter Yin Li) The sky is clear, the sky is clear and the sky is full of color... Recently, Beijing has continued to open the most beautiful blue sky model, attracting thousands of people in the capital to show their happiness on the social platform, basking in the happiness in the continuous brush screen, saying, "Under the blue sky and white clouds,'drunk' the beautiful skyline, this is the best calling card for Beijing."
Since August, Beijing has welcomed the "bluest sky ".
Inside the capital, people can be seen at any time, anywhere, taking photos with their smartphones, or holding up their SLR cameras.
On social platforms such as Weibo and WeChat Friends Circle, the Forbidden City, Tian'anmen, the Bird's Nest and the Hutongs in the footage of netizens can be seen everywhere... all kinds of buildings display different beauty against the blue sky.
Some netizens said that such a "big piece of scenery" is the best urban propaganda film in Beijing; others joked that if such a blue sky is painted for a long time, people with cervical spondylosis can be cured; and some netizens hoped that "this blue sky will be able to winter and spring and summer, so that the sky in the capital will be blue all the year round."
Why do people in the capital particularly like to bask in the blue sky?
Only because the people who lived in the city in the past suffered from the haze, they were particularly eager for the blue sky. After the "blue sky defense war" was launched in Beijing, and the air quality continued to improve, the haze became less, the blue sky increased, the people were happy in their eyes, and the sense of well-being gained was particularly significant.
On the day of National Day, the weather in Beijing was fine and sunny.
At 8 a.m., the majority of the city's 35 air quality monitoring stations were shown to be "first-class" green.
The "Blueest Sky" -themed photo contest on the social platform, which was spontaneous by the public, is still ongoing.
Why is the sky so blue in Beijing recently?
According to the relevant person in charge of the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau, in August this year, the average concentration of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) in Beijing was 35 ug/m3, the best record for the same period in the history of nearly five years.
In September, the real-time concentration of PM2.5 was in the single digits.
A major factor in the emergence of the "bluest sky" is that the weather conditions are generally favorable in the recent period. More importantly, Beijing has consistently carried out air pollution control, vigorously promoted the clean air action plan in the last five years, and continuously released environmental benefits, resulting in a reduction in the total amount of pollutants discharged in the region. These have laid the foundation for the continuous improvement of air quality.
Beijing officially released and implemented the Beijing 2013-2017 Clean Air Action Plan in 2013.
According to the plan, the government has continuously guided non-capital functions to be solved, and promoted clean energy substitution and pollution reduction. A total of 4,923 coal-fired boilers have been eliminated.
As a result, Beijing has become the first major city in mainland China to realize the full-scale natural gasification of the network.
According to the data, between 2013 and 2017, the annual average concentration of PM2.5 in Beijing decreased by 35.6%; the number of days to meet the air quality standards increased by 50 days; the number of first-class excellent days increased by 25 days; the number of days of heavy pollution decreased by 35 days, and the incidence of heavy pollution decreased significantly.
While the air quality continues to improve, Beijing officials, based on a new round of PM2.5 source analysis, issued the "Three-Year Action Plan for Beijing to Win the Blue Sky Defense War" in September this year, focusing on the key prevention and control areas such as diesel trucks, dust and volatile organics, optimizing and adjusting the transport structure, industrial structure, energy structure and land use structure, strengthening the regional joint defense and control, strengthening the fine management of the city, promoting green development in an all-round way, and striving to make the "bluest sky" permanent in the capital, no longer "thin and precious ", and returning it to the background of people's photo albums rather than the main character.
During the Golden Week of the National Day this year, the Municipal Tourism Commission, industry and commerce, city management, public security and other relevant departments will strengthen the law enforcement inspection of the "one-day travel" market, focus on the "six blacks" of tourism. Those who violate the law and regulations will be given heavier and heavier punishment in accordance with the law once they are verified.
Yesterday morning, the municipal government held a special meeting to crack down on illegal "one-day travel ", and made arrangements for the special operation to further crack down on illegal" one-day travel ".
At the meeting, it was revealed that the city has launched a special campaign to crack down on illegal "one-day travel" since July 28, focusing on the "six-black" chaos in which the interests of black ticket holders, black guides, black clubs, black cars, black shops and black networks are intertwined.
Since the launch of the special operation, the city has accepted a total of 39 complaints of "one-day travel ", down 63% year-on-year. Since this year, the city has accepted 270 complaints of" one-day travel ", down 62% year-on-year.
In the past two months, the city has seized 248 "black cars ", investigated and dealt with 158 violations of the travel and passenger transport business, closed down 29 shopping" black shops "and performing arts venues, investigated and dealt with 13" black clubs "and 27" black guides ", confiscated 26,000 illegal advertisements, removed 31 illegal "one-day travel" billboards and 3 bus stop signs, investigated and dealt with 1,789 cases of illegal travel-related acts, filed 181 cases by various functional departments, imposed a heavy fine of RMB4.48 million, and detained 111 people involved in travel-related violations.
After rectification, the illegal "one-day travel" disorder has been basically curbed, and the market order of "one-day travel" has shown a steady and positive trend.
It is reported that in recent years, the city has continuously stepped up its efforts to rectify illegal "one-day travel ".
In 2016 and 2017, the Municipal Tourism Commission accepted 1,612 and 897 "one-day travel" complaints, a year-on-year decrease of 79% and 44%, respectively. However, illegal "one-day travel" continues to be repeatedly fought and often rebounded, and has created a "six-black" chaos with interwoven chains of interests such as black ticket, black guide, black community, black car, black shop and black net.
In particular, illegal street hirers are known as "black ticket holders ", illegal websites that publish false travel information are known as" black websites ", travel agents engaged in illegal "one-day travel" or agencies or individuals without travel agency business qualifications are known as "black clubs ", and tour guides employed by" black clubs "who do not have a travel permit or practice in violation of the rules are known as" black guides ". They use vehicles with no tourist passenger qualification or vehicles with tourist passenger qualification that provide passenger services for illegal "one-day travel" are known as "black cars ". In the end, they bring tourists into designated tourist shopping stores, namely" black shops ".
In this special operation, the city has continuously stepped up the fixed inspection and mobile inspection of illegal "one-day travel ". In view of the frequent occurrence of illegal" one-day travel "and the high impact of tourist routes, the relevant departments have sent a group of unannounced visits to the train every day. After finding evidence of violations of the law and regulations, they will be severely investigated and dealt with in accordance with the law.
Among them, "black car" and "black shop" have become the two key points of the special action.
According to the report, without black cars, illegal "one-day travel" cannot be carried out. Black cars are not only easy to be found, remembered and dealt with, but also a fixed asset with high individual value.
The relevant departments have used the road traffic monitoring probe to strengthen the supervision of the key "one-day travel" line tour buses, and can find and deal with the "black cars" in a timely manner by means of technological and intellectual means such as technical and physical defense.
Tourism shopping "black shops" have also become a serious focus due to their small number and sitting operation.
In order to strengthen the deterrence and fight against illegal "one-day travel ", all functional departments shall, in accordance with the law, impose heavier and heavier penalties on those who have been found to have violated the law and regulations in the special operations.
In August this year, the city also held a seminar on the legal issues related to cracking down on illegal "one-day travel ", and discussed the means and measures of combining administrative punishment with criminal conviction.
The Municipal Tourism Commission said that in the future, more regular travel agencies will be encouraged to carry out "one-day travel" in Beijing and increase the supply of regular "one-day travel" in order to further occupy the living space of illegal "one-day travel ". At present, the specific plan is still under study.
In addition, the Municipal Tourism Commission has continuously improved the electronic travel itinerary information system of tour groups to ensure that each team is included in the supervision of the electronic travel itinerary platform.
From a tourist symbol to a digital economic symbol, what has Wuzhen experienced in these years
As the permanent meeting site of the World Internet Conference, how Wuzhen can take on the dividend of the Summit has attracted much attention.
From the first World Internet Conference, the changes in Wuzhen over the past five years have been witnessed by all.
In 2014, there were only 12 enterprises related to the digital economy and the Internet in the whole town. By the third quarter of this year, there were more than 500.
This is a microcosm of Wuzhen's development of the digital economy.
The convening of the Internet Conference has allowed local enterprises to accept the inspiration of the digital economy and the digital wave at zero distance. The desire of enterprises to transform and upgrade is very strong. Traditional manufacturing enterprises have increased their investment and research and development in such areas as machine replacement and smart management.
Jiang Weiwei, the party secretary of Wuzhen Town, said that Wuzhen will build a new economic empowerment center in the future.
The development of the digital economy cannot be achieved without the support of infrastructure.
This year, Wuzhen launched the 5G pilot work on the basis of achieving full coverage of 4G communication network and free WiFi.
At the same time, Tongxiang City, where Wuzhen is located, as the first county-level city in the country to build a dedicated channel for international Internet data, has also become a hot spot for the development of the Internet industry.
Since the first World Internet Conference, Tongxiang has introduced a total of 565 digital economy projects, with a total planned investment of 37.725 billion yuan. In the first three quarters of this year, the core manufacturing industry of the digital economy achieved a total output value of 8.73 billion yuan. The value added increased by 13% year-on-year.
"Before, Wuzhen was a tourist symbol. Later, there were more drama and cultural symbols. Because of the Internet Conference, it is now a symbol of the Internet and the digital economy."
Sheng Yongjun, the secretary of Tongxiang Municipal Party Committee, believes that the dividends of the World Internet Conference have accumulated over time. Therefore, it is more necessary to build a platform to undertake the superposition and import of talents, projects, technology and other elements from all sides.
Shen Yi, a native of Tongxiang, has been working abroad for 20 years. As a result of being linked to the Internet Conference, she has returned home to start her own business.
On December 2 last year, he walked into the 4th Internet Light Expo with high-capacity tamper-proof digital technology solutions, and was favored by a number of customers.
Shen Yi chose to start a business in Wuzhen not only because of her hometown complex. "In Wuzhen, it is easier to recruit people than I thought. Our application also landed quickly. There are our applications in the Wuzhen smart parking project."
A Wuzhen Avenue, presenting the spillover effect of the Internet Conference.
This thoroughfare, which connects the north and south of Tongxiang, is not only a string of tourist attractions, but also an industrial thoroughfare.
Relying on it, Wuzhen Avenue Co-Creative Cluster Area emerged as the times require.
Reporters learned that in the future, Wuzhen Avenue will become the main site for the industrial development of Tongxiang. It will take the lead in applying a large number of achievements such as smart medical care, smart old-age pension and smart government affairs. It will bring together industries that account for 80% of the city's GDP and a large number of high-level talents.
At least 410 people have been killed in a tsunami triggered by a powerful earthquake in Indonesia
According to the director of the public information bureau of the Jakarta police in Indonesia on the evening of the 29th, the current earthquake in Central Sulawesi province has killed 410 people, of whom 97 have been identified.
Another 29 people were missing and 540 were injured.
Palu Airport is still closed.
Active treatment, the survival rate of preterm infants aged 29 weeks and above in China reached 98%, which has reached the level of developed countries.
On September 30, CNN Shanghai (Chen Jing Luo Yanqian) National Children's Medical Center and Fudan University Affiliated Paediatric Hospital disclosed that it had introduced Canada's advanced method in the leading "Project for Improving the Prognosis Quality of Premature Infants in China NICU Hospital ".
The results of the project showed that after active treatment, the survival rate of preterm infants aged 29 weeks and above in China reached 98%, which has reached the level of developed countries. However, there is still much room for improvement in the survival rate of preterm infants with minimal gestational age and preterm infants without complications.
For the past 20 years, the Chinese government has been concerned about the treatment of newborn babies.
At present, the infant mortality rate in the Shanghai area has fallen to 3.71 per thousand, significantly lower than the national average and reaching the advanced level of developed countries.
"The Project for Improving the Prognosis Quality of Premature Infants in Hospitalized NICU in China" has significantly improved the quality of life of premature babies through four years of unremitting efforts.
Professor Cao Yun, director of the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of the Paediatric Hospital affiliated to Fudan University, told reporters that while improving the survival rate of preterm infants, attention should be paid to reducing the quality of survival of preterm infants, reducing the incidence of complications, improving the prognosis of neurodevelopment and improving the overall outcome of children. This is of great significance for improving the overall quality of life and the quality of the population of preterm infants. It is an important issue of concern to the pediatric and neonatal community at home and abroad. It is also a key issue of concern for this project.
Through four years of unremitting efforts, the "Project for Improving the Quality of Prognosis of Premature Infants in Hospitalized NICU in China" included tens of thousands of premature babies with gestational age of 33 weeks and below. This resulted in a one-third reduction in the mortality rate of premature infants with small gestational age and small birth weight. At the same time, the incidence of serious complications of premature infants decreased significantly, greatly improving the quality of life of premature infants.
Through the establishment of a national cooperative network for improving the quality of newborns, and the introduction of the concept of collaborative quality improvement, the project radiates 25 cooperative hospitals across China, and establishes a set of integrated, systematic and effective methods for improving the quality of collaboration for improving the prognosis of premature infants and improving the level of newborn care.
The Paediatric Hospital affiliated to Fudan University is working with the National Neonatal Unit to draw up guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections based on the accumulated experience of the project, so as to provide reference and guidance for the standard diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections in China.
It is understood that in the "Prognosis Quality Improvement Project for Premature Infants in China ", the pediatric hospital introduced the EPIQ method to 25 large-scale NICUs in 19 provinces across the country. It is committed to solving the problem of premature infant infection that plagues the neonatal care unit in China.
After more than 10 years of continuous improvement, the complication-free survival rate of premature babies in Canada has increased by about one-third. Canada is now one of the countries with the best prognosis for premature babies in the world.
The EPIQ method has now been applied to all NICUs in Canada, and has been adopted and applied in six countries.
The paediatric hospital revealed that the results of the study showed that two years after the EPIQ intervention, the infection of premature babies fell by 35%, while the use of antibiotics fell by 20%.
In the future, the Paediatric Hospital affiliated to Fudan University will continue to popularize and implement this method to the whole country, with a view to comprehensively reducing the incidence of all complications of premature babies and improving the quality of treatment for newborns throughout the country.
At present, it is an indisputable fact that there are differences and heterogeneity in the level of treatment in various regions of China.
According to Professor Cao Yun, as an important construction unit of the National Children's Medical Center, pediatric hospitals will play a leading role in radiation. This study covers a number of western provinces, including Xinjiang, Guizhou, Gansu and Shaanxi, with a view to gradually promoting the homogenization and standardization of newborn care throughout the country.
It is understood that the Paediatric Hospital affiliated to Fudan University is working with the National Neonatal Unit to draw up guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections based on the accumulated experience of the project, so as to provide reference and guidance for the standard diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections in China.
It was revealed that in 2019, the China Neonatal Collaboration Network, located at the Paediatric Hospital affiliated to Fudan University, will work with 63 hospitals across the country to carry out the next phase of national quality improvement, with a view to promoting the balanced development of the level of newborn care in China.
Wu Jinglei, director of the Shanghai Municipal Health and Family Planning Commission, said that Shanghai can become a central city in the heart of Asia, not only in research, but also in the construction of the entire service system. The quality of services and the results of services should have a place in Asia, thus truly reflecting China's medical level.
Xin Zhiping: Build up the "Monument to Heroes" in the heart - written on the fifth Martyrs' Day.
On September 30, on the eve of the 69th birthday of the Republic, we celebrated the fifth Martyrs' Day. Xi Jinping and other party and state leaders came to Tiananmen Square to attend the flower basket-laying ceremony for the people's heroes.
At this moment, no matter where you are, please pay tribute to Ying Li.
Memorial Day is a reenactment, but also a wake-up call.
Turn over the heavy history, behind the name of each martyr, is a living life.
They, too, have hot youth, sincere love, and concerned families.
However, because they firmly believe that "the doctrine we believe in is the truth of the universe ", they are willing to sacrifice all of their own in order to" spare the suffering of the next generation ".
"I will cry a day for China as soon as I survive."
Through time and space, the heroes set up a spiritual signpost to guide the way forward.
"Where to come from, where to go "," What kind of person to be ", read Ying Lie, it is not difficult to come to an answer.
In memory of Ying Li, the most important thing is to build a "monument to the hero" in the heart.
According to incomplete statistics, since the revolutionary war years, some 20 million martyrs have died heroically for national independence, the liberation of the people and the prosperity and strength of the country.
For a variety of reasons, many of the martyrs did not even leave their names.
Countless heroes have watered their ideals with blood, practiced their faith with their lives, remembered their famous names, and passed on their spirit, which is to protect the roots and souls of the nation.
This "Monument to Heroes" does not allow for any defacement or destruction.
For some time, historical nihilism, pan-entertainment and other undercurrents have been surging.
A variety of practices that distort history and degrade Britishness, challenge the conscience of justice, derange value judgment, and arouse public indignation and vigilance of the whole society.
Ying Li cannot be profaned. Heroes cannot forget.
The act of touching the bottom line cannot be left unchecked. We must dare to show our swords and defend the dignity of the British people with the rule of law and justice.
On May 1 this year, the Law on the Protection of Heroic Martyrs officially came into effect.
From the point of view of judicial practice, the judgments in some cases are very popular. They not only effectively safeguard the glorious image of Yingli in accordance with the law, but also release the positive energy of worshipping heroes and honoring martyrs.
A nation with aspirations cannot be without heroes, a country with ideals cannot be without pioneers.
It has become a common social consensus to honor the memory of the martyrs and call for the heroes.
At present, there are millions of memorial facilities of various kinds in the country, and more than 100 million people visit the Martyrs' Mausoleum every year.
The human heart is the strongest foundation stone.
Let the worship of heroes, the defense of heroes, the study of heroes, and the care of heroes become a common practice. Let the spirit of heroes be integrated into the blood of the nation. A "Monument to Heroes" will stand majestically between heaven and earth and deep in the hearts of the people.
BRUSSELS, Sept 28 (Reuters) - The European Union took a non-confrontational stance against Italy on Friday after Italy defied EU demands and surprised markets with a massive budget deficit plan, but the EU may take a more aggressive stance if Italy sticks to too bold a goal.
Italy ’ s Euroskeptic government is targeting a budget deficit equivalent to 2.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) for the next three years, suggesting that there is still no debt reduction in the face of deficit reduction requirements.
"We have no interest in the crisis between the Commission and Italy," the European Commission's economic affairs executive, Moscovici, said on Friday, taking a cautious response as the EU's proposals and sanctions may have little impact on Italy.
EU officials and diplomats still hope that market forces will be able to persuade Italy to adjust its budget plan before it is formally presented to the European Commission in mid-October.
The euro fell to its lowest level in nearly two weeks on Friday after the government announced its plans, while Italian bond yields hit their highest in three weeks.
If the deficit target remains unchanged by the October deadline, the European Commission may veto Italy's draft budget, something it has never done to any country.
At a meeting in the Latvian capital Riga later on Friday, the vice president of the European Commission said Italy's current fiscal plan "does not seem to be in line with the Stability and Growth Pact," referring to the EU's fiscal rules.
But he did not say how that would trigger a reaction from the EU.
Bidders can submit their applications to participate in this open tender before October 26 this year.
Previously, the Russian Ministry of Agriculture took China as one of the priority markets for Russian agricultural exports.

Chinese news agency Sapporo, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Following the 3-0 victory over Cuba in the first game, the Chinese women's volleyball team won the 2018 World Championship two-match series with a 3-0 victory over Turkey on September 30.
But compared with the first war, the battle of Chinese women's volleyball team is more difficult and dangerous.
A total of 24 teams took part in the 2018 Women's World Championship. The Chinese women's volleyball team is in Group B with Italy, Turkey, Bulgaria, Canada and Cuba.
From the world rankings and overall strength of the Group B teams, Turkey and Italy are the main rivals of the Chinese team.
After the start of the match on the same day, the Chinese team entered the state relatively quickly. They took the lead in the opening game. They maintained their advantage throughout the match. They put a lot of pressure on their opponents in serving and blocking, and won the first game more smoothly at 25:18.
The Turkish team, which entered the game in the second game, had a ferocious serve and gained a 6-2 lead in the opening game. After requesting a timeout, the Chinese team adjusted the formation and gradually chased the score to 7, and then repeatedly blocked the score and scored a score of 7:0. At the end of the game, the Turkish team once chased the score to 15:19. After the Chinese team got the set point at 24:20, the tenacious Turkish team scored two more points. After the Chinese team again requested a timeout, with Zhu Ting's running attack score, they took the second game at 25:23.
The situation in the third set was very tight. The scores of the two sides rose alternately. At one point, they were tied at 19.
At the critical moment, the Turkish team made a mistake. After taking the lead at 21:19, the Chinese team won the match point at 24:21 thanks to Zhu Ting's powerful smash and Zhang Changning's attack. Then the Turkish team chased the score to 23:24. After the Chinese team requested a timeout, Zhang Changning scored in attack and the Chinese team clinched the win at 25:23.
Chinese women's volleyball coach Lang Ping admitted after the game that the whole match was not easy.
"We are better prepared, the blocking is good, the Turkish team is more comprehensive in technology. We must reduce our mistakes and strive to win through our own initiative."
In the face of her former familiar teammates, Zhu Ting, who plays for Turkey's Vakiver Bank team, was subjected to a number of restrictions in the first game of the day's competition. Then she took the initiative to change and still played a strong attack.
"They are familiar with each other and it's normal to be watched by their opponents, but the Chinese team played to the extreme, blocking and attacking well in a bad pass."
Next, the Chinese women's volleyball team will be suspended for a day to carry out physical and technical training. On October 2, they will meet Canada, the third opponent of the group.

Nearly 1,000 state-owned scenic spots have cut ticket prices by more than half by more than 20%.
[Abstract] As of September 28, 981 scenic spots have been opened free of charge or reduced price measures (74 free of charge and 907 reduced price) have been announced to the public by various localities. The Shilin, Dali Santa, Yulong Xueshan in Yunnan, Lijiang River in Guilin, Wuyishan in Fujian, Zhangjiajie in Hunan, Terracotta Warriors in Shaanxi, Sanqingshan in Jiangxi, Kanas in Xinjiang and other scenic areas have all implemented price reductions.
In order to implement the decision-making and deployment of the Central Economic Work Conference and the Report on the Work of the Government, the National Development and Reform Commission issued the Guiding Opinions on Improving the Mechanism for the Formation of Ticket Prices in State-owned Scenic Areas to Reduce the Ticket Prices in Key State-owned Scenic Areas (hereinafter referred to as the Guiding Opinions) on June 28, requiring that the mechanism for the formation of ticket prices in State-owned Scenic Areas be improved in terms of reasonably defining the composition of ticket pricing costs, innovative price management methods, and strictly implementing the pricing procedures, so as to ensure that the price of tickets in key state-owned Scenic Areas will be reduced by the end of September with obvious results.
All localities have actively carried out work in accordance with the deployment requirements, and have successively reduced the price of tickets for a number of key state-owned scenic spots.
As of September 28, 981 scenic spots have been opened to the public free of charge or reduced prices (74 free of charge and 907 reduced). Of these, 159 are Grade 5A scenic spots and 534 are Grade 4A scenic spots, with a total of 693, accounting for 70.6%.
Of the 907 scenic spots that were cut in price, 491, or 54.3%, fell by more than 20%, and 214, or 23.6%, fell by more than 30%.
The number of cut-price scenic spots in Yunnan, Shandong, Guangxi, Shaanxi and other provinces is relatively large. Among them, the number of cut-price scenic spots in Yunnan is over 100, with an overall reduction of more than 30%.
Anhui, Chongqing and other eight provinces (districts and cities) have all achieved price reductions for the 5A-grade scenic spots.
The Lijiang River in Guilin, Wuyi Mountain in Fujian Province, Zhangjiajie in Hunan Province, Terracotta Warriors in Shaanxi Province, Sanqing Mountain in Jiangxi Province, Kanas in Xinjiang and other scenic areas with high social concern have all implemented price reductions.
The gradual return of ticket prices to a reasonable range in key state-owned scenic spots is conducive to accelerating the transformation and upgrading of tourism from ticket economy to industrial economy, small-scale tourism to mass tourism and scenic spot tourism to tourism in the whole region. It is conducive to forming a virtuous circle of optimizing the supply structure of tourism and steadily expanding the demand for tourism consumption, and promoting the sustainable and healthy development of scenic spots and tourism.
At the same time, the National Development and Reform Commission stressed that all localities should strengthen the price order of scenic spots, guide scenic spots to upgrade services, and ensure that price cuts do not reduce quality.
In addition, the National Development and Reform Commission has carried out a special inspection on the recent media reports that the price of tickets for individual scenic spots has been reduced too little and that the price of tickets has not been lowered. The National Development and Reform Commission has asked all localities to deal with the problem seriously, respond to social concerns in a timely manner, and effectively implement the price reduction in place.
Trade Promotion Bureau to carry out short-, medium- and long-term optimization work in an orderly manner
The Macao Trade and Investment Promotion Bureau has submitted a short-, medium- and long-term optimization report on "major investment migrants" and "skilled migrants ". At present, in addition to stepping up the promotion and implementation of all the work contained in the report, it has also been continuously listening to the views of the community and continuously optimizing the contents of the report and related work.
The Trade Promotion Bureau will introduce the relevant optimization work to all sectors of the community as soon as possible.
Among them, five are short-term measures to be implemented in this year; five are medium-term measures to be implemented in 2019; and one is a long-term measure.
In addition, the TDC also conducted a comprehensive review of the internal management system in accordance with the instructions of the Secretary for Economic and Financial Affairs, Mr. Victor Leung.
The five short-term measures to be implemented in this year include:
1. To carry out a review. Priority will be given to the cases that are about to expire in the next seven years, the cases mentioned in the ICAC report, and the new renewal cases. If cases of misconduct or signs of illegality are found, they will be referred to the relevant judicial authorities for follow-up;
2. Field inspection of projects involving "major investment migrants ". By late September, more than 20 investment projects had been inspected;
3. To conduct a comprehensive review of the current assessment system. Six principles for the analysis of investment projects have been re-established in the assessment of applications for "major investment migrants ". In the assessment of applications for" skilled migrants ", the relevant approval mechanism will be improved by identifying the elements conducive to the development of Australia and the conditions for preferential recruitment of talent. At the same time, a list of "five industries and ten types of work" has been drawn up for the annual priority recruitment of talent, in line with the policy direction of the HKSAR Government, so as to better target the recruitment of talent;
4. To gradually increase the transparency of information. This includes plans to gradually publish the approval criteria, grading standards and weights from the fourth quarter of this year, and to further refine and make public the approval data;
5. In terms of improving the work of the confirmation mechanism, it has been required to check and verify the work situation in Australia before the confirmation. Major investments must be checked and submitted to the site.
The five medium-term measures to be implemented in 2019 include:
1. Establish a mechanism to regularly listen to the views of the Manpower Development Committee and the Economic Development Committee. A working meeting was held with the Economic Development Committee in September to discuss the establishment of the relevant mechanism.
2. Require the applicant to submit annual financial statements made by an independent third party in order to continuously review the operation of the investment project;
3. Further standardize and electronicize the process of case application and approval in order to reduce human error;
4. Conduct a comprehensive review of the current staffing and coordinate with the implementation of a number of optimization measures;

The experts of the national on-site observation and discussion and exchange activities of membraneless cotton walked into the test field and listened to the representative of the team of academician Yu Shuxun of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.
On September 30, CNN Xinjiang Shaya (Geng Dan Wang Xiaojun) was located at the filmless cotton planting test base in Shaya County, Xinjiang. Membrane-free cotton is growing well. Compared with the film cotton next to it, it is "no less beautiful ". A cluster of snow-white cotton is competitively" open "and hung with branches.
From September 27 to 28, the national film-free cotton on-site observation and discussion and exchange activities were held in Shaya County, Xinjiang.
Reporters learned at the observation meeting that the membrane-free cotton technology system, with "China Cotton 619" and its supporting cultivation measures as the main body, has preliminarily achieved the goal of membrane-free planting in cotton fields, reduced the pollution of the ecological environment and raw cotton by the residual film of cotton fields in Xinjiang, and made significant progress in the research and demonstration of membrane-free cotton comprehensive technology.
Academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, renowned cotton genetic breeder and chief scientist of the cotton system of the state modern agricultural industry technology system, Yu Shuxun, introduced the growth of membrane-free cotton to Zhou Guomo, the party secretary of Zhejiang University of Agriculture and Forestry.
"The comprehensive technology of membrane-free cotton developed by us can completely realize the cultivation of cotton without mulch. It can completely solve the problem of residual film pollution and realize green cotton planting."
Yu Shuxun, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, introduced.
Xinjiang is the most important cotton-producing area in China. According to the statistics of the National Bureau of Statistics, the cotton-growing area of Xinjiang in 2017 was 35 million mu, accounting for 61% of the total cotton area of the country.
Since the introduction of geomembrane into China in 1982, the mulching area of all kinds of crops in Xinjiang has reached more than 50 million mu, and the annual use of geomembrane is about 300,000 tons.
Among them, cotton mulch coverage reached 100%, and cotton mulching accounted for about 60% of the use of mulch in Xinjiang.
Membrane-free cotton production is measured, and the cotton yield can be fully realized from 320 kg to 350 kg per mu.
With the continuous increase of the input of Xinjiang's geomembrane, the recovery rate of residual geomembrane is low, the amount of residual film in the soil is gradually increasing, and the residual film causes the destruction of soil structure and other problems, which seriously affect the sustainable development of agriculture.
The residual film not only causes serious pollution to the soil, but also has a great impact on the quality of cotton fiber.
At present, more than one-third of the cotton fields in Xinjiang have been mechanizedly harvested.
In 2017, Xinjiang's machine-picked cotton area was about 14 million mu.
In the process of machine-picked cotton harvest, a large amount of broken film on the surface and on the cotton plant is collected. The broken film doped in raw cotton is difficult to be removed in the process of raw cotton processing, and cannot be completely removed in the subsequent textile processing process, seriously affecting the quality of textile products.
On September 28, the national film-free cotton on-site observation and discussion and exchange activities were held in Shaya County, Xinjiang.
In order to focus on solving the membrane pollution in cotton fields, simplify the cotton planting technology and improve the benefits of cotton fields, Yu Shuxun led his team to implement the "China Cotton 619" membraneless cotton planting technology over a period of eight years to "add wings" to the green development of agriculture in Xinjiang.
Yu Shuxun introduced that through innovative new ideas of breeding, a new line of land cotton, "Zhong Mian 619 ", which is particularly precocious, salt-resistant, low-temperature resistant and high-yield, has been cultivated.
"Under the conditions of film-free cultivation in the southern region of Xinjiang,'China Cotton 619' has achieved a series of supporting measures, such as the matching of film-free seeding machinery, the improvement of seeding depth, the shallow burial of dropper belt under film-free conditions, the screening of suitable seeding density, and reasonable chemical regulation."
At present, model bases for membrane-free cotton have been established in Aksu, Kurle, Alar and other places, with a yield of 4,800 kg per hectare.
Planting cotton without film has achieved high yield, cost-saving and environmental protection, and improved comprehensive benefits.
Zhang Donghai, a agronomist at the Agricultural Science Institute of the Third Division of Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, said that through the research and demonstration of membraneless cotton cultivation technology in the last six years, the yield of membraneless cotton seed cotton can be fully realized from 320 kg to 350 kg per mu, and may even be higher.
"The prospects for the popularization of membraneless cotton cultivation technology are great."
Zhang Donghai believes that at present, membrane-free cotton cultivation technology can completely solve the problem of soil residual film pollution, but there is still a certain gap in economic benefits compared to film cultivation at present.
"The support of cotton purchase price will be conducive to future promotion."
Yu Shuxun said that in the next step, he and his team will continue to carry out in-depth research and large-scale promotion and application of membrane-free cotton, make the membrane-free cotton industry bigger and stronger, and thoroughly solve the problem of soil pollution caused by mulching.

Reporters learned from the Ministry of Finance on the 30th that the four departments of the Ministry of Finance, the State Administration of Taxation, the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Commerce jointly issued a notice recently. In order to further encourage overseas investors to invest in China, the profits distributed by overseas investors from resident enterprises in China will be used for domestic direct investment. The scope of application of the policy of withholding income tax for domestic direct investment will be extended to all non-prohibited foreign investment projects and fields.
This policy has been implemented since January 1, 2018.

Former foreign aid accused of playing fake ball north control response to "nothing" - China News Service
Yesterday afternoon, Beijing Holding Football Club (hereinafter referred to as Northern Control) issued an official response to the news that Anichebe, a former foreign aid to the team, had accused the team of playing fake football. The North Control side issued a statement saying that there was absolutely no case of playing fake football on the part of the club. This was entirely a lie invented by Anichebe himself during the arbitration process in order to cover up the fact that he had flagrantly violated the contract agreement and for his personal improper economic purposes.
At the same time, North Control said it would reserve the right to take all means to investigate the responsibility of the relevant parties.
According to the Daily Mail, Nigerian player Anichebe has alleged to FIFA that the Beijing North Control Team, which he played for last year, is suspected of playing fake football, including the Beijing derby in the 21st round of the 2017 season.
At that time, it was a crucial stage for Beijingers and Chongchao. The game ended in a 0-2 defeat to Beijingers and Anichebi, who started.
There was an official response from the Northern Control Club yesterday to the Nigerian player's claims.
The statement said that after the club's previous internal investigation, the team participated in the game did not exist in the situation of playing fake ball.
Anichebe joined Beijing North Control in June 2017. In December of the same year, Anichebe refused to return to the team for winter training without good reason, and refused to return to the team despite repeated reminders from the club.
At present, the dispute between the two sides has been submitted to FIFA and arbitration is in progress.
The statement also mentioned that the high-profile "fake ball charge" was in fact a lie invented by Anichebe during the arbitration process in order to cover up the fact that he had flagrantly violated the contract, and for his personal improper economic purposes.
Its sole purpose of defaming clubs and defaming Chinese football is to gain illegitimate economic benefits.
The club also does not accept any organization or any individual to make groundless accusations, slander, slander and slander against the club for the sake of their economic interests and personal grudges.
Therefore, the north control side said that it would reserve the right to take all means to hold the relevant parties accountable.

The Chinese reporter was taken away by the police at the annual meeting of the British Conservative Party. China demanded an apology
According to the website of the Chinese Embassy in the UK, the spokesperson of the embassy in the UK answered questions on Monday about a Chinese journalist being taken away by the police during the annual meeting of the British Conservative Party.
The spokesman pointed out that we asked the Conservative Party Human Rights Committee to stop interfering in China's internal affairs, stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs, and ask the conference organizers to apologize to Chinese journalists.
A reporter asked: On September 30, during the annual meeting of the British Conservative Party, the party's Human Rights Committee held a side meeting on the Hong Kong issue and invited the Hong Kong opposition to speak at the meeting.
A Chinese reporter was taken away by the police during the side meeting.
What is your comment, please?
In response, the spokesman said that in the 21 years since Hong Kong's return to the motherland, the practice of "one country, two systems" has achieved great success, and Hong Kong's development achievements are universally acknowledged.
Hong Kong is China's Hong Kong. Hong Kong's affairs are purely China's internal affairs.
The Conservative Party Human Rights Committee used the party's annual meeting to hold a side event for anti-China separatist forces. China expressed serious concern and strong dissatisfaction.
We are firmly opposed to anyone and any organization interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any way.
Any attempt and act of advocating "Hong Kong independence" is futile.
The spokesman said that the UK always flaunts freedom of speech, but when Chinese journalists ask questions and express their views at the side meeting, they are subjected to all kinds of obstruction and even physical aggression, which is totally unacceptable.
We demand that the Conservative Party Human Rights Committee stop interfering in China's internal affairs, stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs, and ask the conference organizers to apologize to Chinese journalists.

In a speech to the U.S. Foreign Relations Committee on Friday, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that at present, China-U.S. relations have reached a crossroads once again. If the two sides can positively and inclusively view each other, expand and deepen positive cooperation, and properly manage differences and contradictions, they can open up a better future.
"China-U.S. relations are our common assets, and we need to take care of them together."
He expressed the hope that people from all walks of life in the two countries will take concrete actions to safeguard the healthy and stable development of Sino-U.S. relations, and jointly push forward the China-U.S. relations in the right direction.
Wang Yi also stressed once again that China will surely follow a different development path from that of the traditional big countries.
This path with Chinese characteristics has determined that China will not and cannot repeat the mistakes of national strength and hegemony. It has also determined that China will neither become the United States, challenge the United States, nor replace the United States.
In a speech entitled "Opportunities or Challenges, Partners or Rivals ", Wang Yi said that the deep-seated crux of the current problems lies in the fact that some American friends believe that China will also become a powerful country and will even challenge and replace the leadership of the United States in the world.
"This is clearly a major strategic miscalculation."
But this self-imagining suspicion is spreading and amplifying existing contradictions, creating new doubts, and making it more difficult for China and the United States to solve specific problems and encounter more resistance, he said.
Wang Yi pointed out that China has followed a road of peaceful development.
The Chinese have never had a gene for outward expansion.
We believe that all countries can live together in harmony, exchange and learn from each other.
Whether in the past, now or in the future, China will neither copy the foreign model nor ask other countries to copy China's practices.
Earlier, when Wang Yi met with former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in New York, he said that Sino-U.S. cooperation will win-win, and confrontation will inevitably lose both.
China has always been committed to developing long-term, healthy and stable China-U.S. relations, achieving non-conflict and non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation.
China's new office held a press conference on Tuesday to introduce and interpret the white paper "Facts on Sino-US Economic and Trade Frictions and China's Position ".
Fu Ziying, Vice Minister of Commerce of China, said at the briefing that China is willing to work hard to promote the development of bilateral trade in a more balanced direction, and hopes that the US side will also show a positive attitude.
On October 1, it was reported that the Indonesian island of Sulawesi was hit by a strong earthquake and tsunami on September 28, and several cities along the coast were severely damaged. The latest news shows that the number of people killed has increased to 1,200.
According to reports, the town of Donggala in Palu, near the epicenter, was hit by two waves of tsunami. As the "golden 72 hours" of rescue passed, the authorities believe the number of people killed will continue to rise.
Rescuers carry an earthquake survivor rescued from under the rubble of a restaurant in Palu, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, September 30, 2018, local time.
Officials from the disaster relief department said that the tsunami caused huge waves of up to 6 meters, and the scope of the earthquake and tsunami impact exceeded people's original estimates.
It is reported that when the earthquake and tsunami occurred, hundreds of people were celebrating the festival on the beach in Palu. Many people were killed when the huge wave swept them away.
Officials say the tsunami hit the shore at a speed of 800 kilometers per hour, destroying many buildings and infrastructure.
He said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed, and a tsunami-triggered mudslide cut off a major highway in Palu.
A bridge across a coastal river collapsed in Sulawesi.
On September 30, local time, Indonesian President Joko visited the city of Central Sulawesi Palu, where the earthquake occurred.
Indonesian President Joko visited the disaster area on September 30 and said that he had sent troops to assist in the search and rescue, calling on the victims to be patient.
Jokow pointed out that the rescue operation is very difficult due to the shortage of heavy machinery and manpower.
He learned that there was a lack of water, food, fuel and other supplies in many parts of the disaster area. In addition, many businesses have closed down after the earthquake, and aircraft have been sent to airdrop supplies.
He called on the victims to be patient and stay in their original positions and wait for help.
Search and rescue workers in the city of Palu said they heard a call for help coming from a collapsed hotel in the city, but were helpless because there was no heavy machine to remove the rubble. Some people needed to save people with their bare hands.
Indonesia's Vice President Kara said the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami could eventually rise to thousands after power and communications were cut off in some areas, resulting in unblocked information.
On November 5, a reporter from Shenyang (reporter Xu Zhiqiang correspondent Yan Yina) learned today from the meeting of the Liaoning Provincial Court on the basic resolution of the implementation difficulties, that the Liaoning Provincial Court, during the six-month campaign to carry out the "storm ", severely cracked down on the refusal to carry out the act, transferred a total of 241 people who refused to carry out the crime, and maintained the high-pressure situation of cracking down on the refusal to carry out the illegal crime.
It is understood that, in accordance with the unified deployment of the Liaoning Provincial High Court, from the beginning of April to the end of September, the Liaoning Provincial Court launched a six-month campaign to basically solve the implementation difficulties of the "storm ", rally the superior forces and launch an all-round general attack on the implementation difficulties of the basic solutions.
At the same time, the provincial courts have organized and carried out the activities of "five batches" of fines, detention of one batch, restriction of consumption of one batch, punishment for breach of trust, and transfer of one batch of refusal to commit a crime according to law.
At the beginning of the activity, there were more than 132,000 outstanding enforcement cases in the provincial courts. At the end of July, the case was cleared to the bottom.
During the activities, the provincial court fined the person subjected to execution a total of 12.0607 million yuan, detained 4,146 people, restricted consumption of 162,844 people, punished 55,128 people for breach of trust, and transferred 241 people for refusing to commit the crime.

"Where can I take a taxi, please?
We want to go to Golden Bauhinia Square to see the National Day flag-raising ceremony! "
Song and his wife, who specially flew from Ningxia to Shenzhen and transferred to the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong high-speed railway national day bus in Shenzhen, were interviewed by a reporter from the China News Agency at the West Kowloon Station in Hong Kong on the morning of October 1.
On the morning of October 1, to celebrate the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government held a solemn flag-raising ceremony at Golden Bauhinia Square.
According to the statistics of the immigration control points, as of September 30, the number of passengers entering Hong Kong via the West Kowloon Station of the High-speed Rail has exceeded 300,000.
On the occasion of the 69th anniversary of the birth of the motherland, the West Kowloon Border Inspection Station is expected to see a peak of tourists visiting Hong Kong on October 1 and 2.
Reporters met at the arrival hall at 7 a.m. on the first day of the day. Many Mainland tourists took advantage of the National Day Golden Week to take the high-speed rail and tour Hong Kong.
A brisk-footed Mrs. Song told reporters that the National Day holiday is a rare long holiday in a year. It has always been her wish to come to Hong Kong's Golden Bauhinia Square to see the flag raised. She felt particularly happy and excited to achieve this wish on the National Day.
At present, however, flights between Ningxia and Hong Kong are inconvenient. Fortunately, the Hong Kong section of the high-speed railway is open to traffic. After checking the train schedule, Mr. Song found that the first bus will arrive at 7:03 a.m. and connect the city transport to Golden Bauhinia Square. The time is just right.
He lamented with reporters: "The high-speed rail is so convenient, fast and on time!"
The 70 daily one-hour short-distance trains between Guangzhou South, Shenzhen North and Fukuda and West Kowloon have greatly facilitated the arrival of residents from Guangdong, Hong Kong, Macao and the Greater Bay Area.
When Mr. Liu, who lives in Shenzhen, arrived in Hong Kong, he was preparing to meet his Hong Kong friends at the top of the Central Mountain.
Mr. Liu said, "The Mainland and Hong Kong are on holiday on National Day. We are going to challenge ourselves to see if we can walk the 50 km Hong Kong Island Trail!"
He explained that without the opening of the high-speed railway, convenient travel and sufficient time, they would not have dared to attempt such a long-distance hiking.
Yang Taitai, from Dongguan, took her 10-year-old son on a high-speed train to Hong Kong to participate in the piano competition. She proudly told reporters that her son had been studying piano for three years. It was meaningful to spend the National Day in this way.
Before coming to Hong Kong, she had been taking the bus, but it took time and effort. She was worried about affecting her son's condition. This time, she came by high-speed rail via Shenzhen. Customs clearance was convenient and the time was halved. She was even more impressed by the journey of the Hong Kong section. She told reporters, "It's like taking the subway. It's very fast. I didn't even have time to take a picture!"
At 6:44 a.m. on September 23, the G5711 "Harmony" high-speed train set off from Shenzhen North Station and sped along the way. A few minutes later, the train entered the Hong Kong section of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong high-speed railway. This is the first officially operated high-speed rail train in the Hong Kong section.
The Hong Kong section of the high-speed railway, which is integrated into the country's 25,000 km high-speed rail network and directly reaches 38 long-distance stations across the country, also welcomes Mainland tourists from different provinces in the north and south of the country.
Mr. Gao, who came to Hong Kong from Changsha to visit his family during the Xiaochang holiday, told reporters that before, the high-speed railway could only travel to Shenzhen North, take the subway to pass through Hong Kong and then travel around the city. It was troublesome and time-consuming. Now, he sits directly in the Kowloon Center and can eat lunch made by his children when he gets home. He feels very happy.
He said that the convenience of the "one place, two places" clearance process is beyond imagination. "In less than 10 minutes, both customs clearances have passed."
The West Kowloon Station, which is adjacent to the Airport Express and connects land and air traffic, has also become the preferred destination for many transit passengers.
Miss Wu, from Fujian, was going to spend the Golden Week with her girlfriends from Hong Kong to the Philippines. She pushed her luggage out of the gate on time in West Kowloon. "I was afraid I wouldn't be able to catch the plane. I didn't expect it to be so fast. There was more than enough time!" she told reporters.
The new U.S.-Mexico-Canadian trade deal will retain U.S. President Donald Trump's ability to implement the threat of a 25 percent tariff on imported cars, while essentially exempting passenger cars, pickup trucks and auto parts imported from Canada and Mexico from paying tariffs, according to a subsidiary arrangement of the trade deal released Monday.
If Trump imposes so-called “Chapter 232 ” tariffs on cars for national security reasons, both Mexico and Canada will have a quota of 2.6 million tax-exempt passenger vehicles exported to the US each year.
Under the subsidiary arrangement, pickup trucks produced in the two countries will be fully exempted from the tariff.
If Trump imposes auto tariffs, Mexico will get a tax exemption quota of $108 billion per year for auto parts, and Canada will get a quota of $32.4 billion.
Both quotas are well above the current production levels of the two countries and provide room for growth of the two countries' exports.
WASHINGTON/Mexico, Sept 28 (Reuters) - After days of debate, U.S. President Donald Trump's administration and Canada are making concrete efforts to resolve their trade policy differences, Mexico said on Friday, raising hopes that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is expected to remain in the form of a trilateral agreement.
Despite the lack of details, the apparent progress was enough to prompt the governments of Mexico and the United States to abruptly halt plans to release the text of the two trade agreements and give Canada more time to join the agreement.
Mexican President-designate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told reporters in Mexico that the U.S. government has made new counter-proposals to the Canadian government and said he will continue to press for the participation of all three countries in NAFTA.
Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said the time to submit the text of the U.S.-Mexico trade agreement to Mexican and U.S. legislation was delayed because the Canadian and U.S. governments tried to reach an agreement "very seriously."
"In the next 48 hours, we will know whether we have reached a text of a three-way agreement or have to publish the text of a two-way agreement," Guajardo said.
Guajardo said his U.S. and Canadian counterparts "specifically requested" that the release of the text be delayed.
A spokesman for the U.S. Trade Representative's Office (USTR) did not comment on the text of the U.S.-Mexican trade agreement and the U.S.-Canada consultations.
Officials from the Canadian Prime Minister's Office and the Foreign Minister's Office did not respond to requests for comment on the counter-proposal.
It's hard to see anything out of the ordinary at a conservation centre on the outskirts of Pretoria, South Africa's capital, where two young lions frolic and play together, but there's nothing unusual about them.
The University of Pretoria announced: "This is the first time that a young lion has ever been born by artificial insemination - the first pair in the world."
Scientists at the school are working on the reproductive system of the female African lion.
Gans Winter, director of the Institute of Mammal Studies at the University of Pretoria, said the two cubs, born on August 25, were a female and a male, quite healthy and normal.
After 18 months of intensive testing, his team finally reached the breakthrough.
"We collected sperm from a healthy male lion," Ganswinter said during a media visit.
Next, the researchers waited for the lioness to be artificially inseminated when the hormone levels in her body reached the right level.
"Fortunately, the result was successful," Ganswinter said.
He said the researchers "tried several times, but unexpectedly didn't put much effort into it."
He said that the aforementioned research breakthrough can be verified repeatedly, and scientists hope to use this technology to save the endangered big cats.
According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, lions have become extinct in 26 countries in Africa, and the total number of surviving wild lions has plummeted by 43% in the past 20 years, leaving only about 20,000.
The African lion is classified as vulnerable by the organization.
"If we don't do something for this animal, they're going to face extinction," Gans Winter said.
He said the new technique does not require the lion to be raised, but simply injects sperm into a fertile lioness, just as North America and Europe have done with captive elephants.
South Korea's exports fell by the most in more than two years in September, but analysts blamed the decline on fewer working days and said global demand for Korean goods remained strong despite rising trade tensions between China and the United States.
Indeed, South Korea's average daily exports increased last month.
In addition, preliminary data released earlier showed double-digit growth in exports in the first weeks of September before the long holiday.
The year-on-year decline in South Korea ’ s exports in September was the largest since July 2016. The decline was larger than the 5.7% decline estimated by 11 analysts polled by Reuters.
The initial value released on Monday showed that the value of exports in September was US $50.6 billion, down from US $51.2 billion in August.
South Korea ’ s exports to China rose 7.8% in September, expanding for the 23rd month in a row, despite concerns that the growing US-China trade dispute could lead to other export-dependent Chinese neighbors also suffering.
South Korea ’ s exports to the US fell by 11.8%, as sales of petroleum products fell.
South Korea's overseas sales of memory chips and petroleum products rose by 28.3% and 13.5%, respectively, despite concerns that the so-called "super cycle" of chips may have peaked.
"However, the impact of the trade conflict will be hard to avoid, as South Korea's exports rely heavily on the U.S. and Chinese markets."
Imports fell 2.1% to $40.8 billion, also less than the 3.1% growth forecast in the Reuters survey.
The initial value of the trade surplus was $9.7 billion in September, up from $6.9 billion in August.
The Ministry of Industry said that thanks to the United States and European Union countries, the global manufacturing industry will remain buoyant, which is a positive factor for South Korean exports.
"The higher export prices caused by the rise in oil prices will also benefit exports in the second half of this year," the statement said.
"However, the continuation of the trade conflict between the U.S. and China, coupled with increased market volatility following the U.S. interest rate hike, are negative pressures on exports."
Exports rose to an average of US $2.6 billion per working day in September, compared to US $2.1 billion in August.
South Korea's Mid-Autumn Festival falls on September 24-26 this year. As a result, there are only 19.5 working days in September, four days less than the same period last year.
South Korea ’ s exports grew by 4.7% in January-September compared to the same period last year.
According to the Nikkei/Markit Purchasing Managers' Index, South Korean manufacturing activity rebounded in September, but was supported by domestic orders as orders from China and Japan fell, threatening to cloud the outlook for other exports.
North Korean media criticizes US for not easing sanctions against North Korea
North Korea's Rodong Sinmun newspaper published an op-ed on September 30, criticizing the United States for not easing sanctions against the DPRK while seeking dialogue with the DPRK, calling it a "paradoxical" practice.
The article said that US Secretary of State Pompeo said on the 14th that "in order to achieve the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, the key is to implement the sanctions against the DPRK," stressing that the position of the United States to continue to implement the UN sanctions resolution remains unchanged.
In the Singapore-North Korea-U.S. Joint Statement, the two sides pledged to establish a new North Korea-U.S. relationship that is compatible with the desire of the people of the two countries for peace and prosperity.
It is undoubtedly a contradiction for the United States to step up its sanctions crackdown while demanding dialogue.
The article said that if we want to establish a new relationship between the DPRK and the United States, build a permanently consolidated peace system on the Korean Peninsula and realize the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, we should put building trust first, start with what can be done, and solve it in stages one by one.
The article also said that the United States should understand that the sanctions crackdown will not work for North Korea.
The article said that even the "North Devonsk" before the "Kazan" wowed the U.S. military.
"We will meet a strong potential adversary," National Interest magazine quoted the U.S. Navy as saying. "Just looking at the North Devonsk submarine is enough."
Fogo, the current commander-in-chief of the U.S. Navy in Europe, also praised the "North Devonsk" submarine.
"This submarine is impressive," he said. "A look at the development of the Russian navy and how to use resources shows that its main efforts in research and development are, first and foremost, to strengthen the submarine fleet."
But National Interest magazine still believes that the United States maintains its advantage over Russia in this area.
"I believe that Western countries still have an asymmetric advantage," Fogo said.
It was previously reported that the Russian Navy will install the submarine "Kazan" in 2019.
The "Kazan "," Novosibirsk ", "Krasnoyarsk" and "Arkhangelsk" multi-purpose submarines are all "White Wax Tree-M" modified, with a displacement of 13,800 tons, a depth of 520 meters, a personnel establishment of 64, and an underwater speed of 31 knots. They will carry mines, torpedoes and "calibre" and "onyx" cruise missiles.

In recent years, the General Administration of Radio and Television has repeatedly called off illegal advertising.
This year, the State Administration of Radio and Television issued a notice to publicly stop the advertising of "0-bubble fruit milk "," Sava cocktail ", "Bonret plant anti-decoction and hair-raising" and other serious violations, such as misguiding and exaggerating propaganda and misleading audiences.
The General Administration of Radio and Television has formulated a number of regulations and circulars to regulate the advertising behavior of radio and television broadcasts.
The "Notice on Further Strengthening the Administration of Advertisements of TV Shopping Shorts broadcasted by TV channels" stipulates that TV channels shall not broadcast advertisements of TV shopping short films during the period between 18:00 and 24:00 every day.
When TV shopping short commercials are broadcast in other time periods, the host shall not be used for publicity, the "call-and-sell" exaggerated voiceover, intonation and movement shall not be used for publicity, the "orthotic "," plastic shape ", "translucence" and "liposuction" shall not be used for publicity or disguised publicity of breast enhancement and weight loss products, and the TV shopping short commercials shall not be broadcast more than 1 (times) per hour per day, each of which shall not exceed 3 minutes.

"For the first time, we have made adjustments to the format of the MAKS International Air and Space Salon," Manturov said. "We suggested that China should be the host country. The Chinese counterparts agreed and accepted our invitation."
Not long ago, Chinese President Xi Jinping attended the 4th Eastern Economic Forum at the invitation of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
This was the first time he had attended the forum.
Ignoring the U.S. threat!
The European Union may reach a crude oil procurement agreement with Iran.
The U.S. government has claimed that a new round of sanctions against Iran will be renewed in November, and even urged other countries to reduce their imports of Iranian oil.
America's allies, however, did not seem to listen.
According to the New York Times, on the 29th, when Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif visited, he revealed that Tehran was close to reaching an agreement with the European Union on the sale of crude oil, despite the threat of US sanctions against any country doing business with Iran.
The central purpose of the agreement is to try to establish a new payment mechanism, i.e. to replace dollar transactions with barter or local currency pricing.
The aim of the approach is to bypass the United States and prevent the United States from blocking financial transfers.
At the same time, while the EU is working on the deal, some French and British officials are also concerned that if the deal is achieved, it will be the most open confrontation between the EU and the US, which opposed the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.
US media said that in an hour-long interview, Zarif's words sounded more optimistic than in recent months.
Because the agreement has the ability to "divest" America's traditional allies and effectively break the US attempt to cut Iran's income.
"This will ensure that we sell oil and benefit," Zarif said, arguing that under the 2015 agreement, countries have a legitimate right to trade with Iran.
EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini also said recently that "no sovereign country or organization can accept other people to decide who they can trade with."
However, she also predicted that before the U.S. government launches its next sanctions in November, U.S. leaders are likely to adopt a series of financial measures aimed at targeting banks, businessmen and countries that have commercial dealings with Tehran.
In May, the U.S. government unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal on the grounds that the agreement was flawed, saying it could not permanently ban Iran from producing nuclear fuel.
The United States then threatened to ban companies that buy Iranian oil and other goods from doing business in the United States.
This threat caused some companies to withdraw from Tehran and the Iranian currency to plummet.
Companies such as Airbus and French oil giant Total have already cancelled billions of dollars in investment in Iraq.
British and French officials have said the US government may "get the upper hand."
Sure enough, according to a recent report in the Turkish media, the US sanctions do not seem to have a great impact on Iran's oil exports.
Iranian Oil Minister Zanganeh recently revealed that no other country except South Korea has stopped buying Iranian oil.
Both Zarif and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani believe that the purpose of a series of US actions is to “tempt ” Iran to violate the agreement.
Zarif was also dismissive of the string of verbal attacks by the US, and even laughed when asked if the US would overthrow the current Iranian government with increasing financial pressure. "It is a regime change strategy, which is the real purpose of the US side."
"Revisiting the Battery and Remembering the Fanghua ": The Opening Ceremony of the Xiamen Hulishan Battery Culture and Tourism Market
That year, Chen Feifei, the first announcer of Fujian Front Radio Station to broadcast Minnan Mandarin, came to the fort to reminisce about the history of the fort.

This regulation fully embodies the characteristics of Fujian, and transforms the mature experience in the practice of building ecological civilization into a legal form to be popularized and implemented: for example, the "Changting experience ", which can be replicated and popularized in the practice of water and soil conservation in Fujian Province, is summarized and promoted in the regulations. It stipulates that the local people's governments at and above the county level shall strengthen the unified leadership of the water and soil conservation work, and delimit the key prevention and treatment areas for soil erosion based on the results of soil and water erosion investigation. For example, the river length system, which originated in Fujian Province, the regulations raise the river length system and the lake length system to the legislative level, and stipulate that the local people's governments at all levels shall fully implement the river length system and the lake length system, and implement the main body, responsibilities and funds of river and lake management.
The regulation stipulates that the system of life-long investigation of liability for ecological environmental damage shall be implemented.
Those who violate the requirements of scientific development and cause serious damage to ecological and environmental resources shall be held accountable for life to the leading cadres and relevant responsible persons who bear the responsibility for leadership.
It is reported that the "Regulations for Promoting the Construction of Ecological Civilization in Fujian Province" will come into force on November 1 this year.

In order to further encourage overseas investors to invest in China, the Ministry of Finance and other four ministries jointly notified that, with effect from January 1, 2018, the scope of application of the policy of withholding income tax on profits distributed by foreign investors from resident enterprises in China for domestic direct investment will be extended to all non-prohibited foreign investment projects and fields.
According to the relevant notice published on the website of the Ministry of Finance, the temporary exemption of foreign investors from the withholding income tax must meet several conditions at the same time, including the direct investment made by foreign investors with a share of the profits, including the capital increase, new construction, equity purchase and other equity investment conducted by foreign investors with a share of the profits, but excluding the addition, transfer and acquisition of shares of listed companies (except for qualified strategic investment).

Reporters learned from the National Health and Health Commission that compared with decades ago, the incidence of malnutrition among children and adolescents in China has decreased, while the incidence of overweight obesity has increased significantly.
Experts pointed out that to maintain a healthy weight, the most important concept is to "cure the disease ", and vigorously promote scientific fitness and reasonable diet.
According to the "Core Information and Interpretation of Chinese Youth Health Education (2018 Edition)" recently released by the National Health and Health Commission, the key to maintaining a healthy weight is reasonable diet and scientific exercise.
Being overweight, obese and losing weight blindly are not good for your health.
The health risks behind "small fat piers" cannot be ignored.
Ding Gangqiang, director of the Institute of Nutrition and Health of the Chinese Center for Disease Prevention and Control, said that overweight and obesity harm the normal growth and development of adolescents, and have a negative impact on their psychology, behavior, cognition and intelligence. It may even lead to high blood pressure, high blood sugar and high blood fat in children.
At the same time, adolescents who are overweight and obese tend to continue into adulthood, which will increase the risk of chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes in adulthood.
Ding Gangqiang said that from 2010 to 2012, the nutritional and health status of Chinese residents showed that the overweight rate of children aged 6-17 in China was 9.6%, the obesity rate was 6.4%, and the combined rate was 16%.
At the same time, the overweight and obesity rate of children and adolescents is higher than that of girls and higher than that of rural areas. The rate of overweight and obesity has increased significantly in recent decades.
How do teenagers cope with being overweight and obese?
Zhang Li, deputy director of the Scientific Fitness and Health Promotion Research Center of the State General Administration of Sports, pointed out that the main causes of adolescent obesity at present are excessive calorie intake and insufficient physical activity.
For this simple obesity, attention should be paid to scientific exercise plus reasonable dietary control.
Zhang Li pointed out that to maintain a healthy weight, the most important concept is to "cure the disease ". A very important part of this is to conduct all-round popular science education for schools, parents and students, popularize the dangers of overweight and obesity, and raise the awareness of prevention among teenagers.
Teenagers should have regular medical check-ups, monitor growth and development indicators such as height and weight, and make early detection and scientific judgment on whether there are overweight and obesity problems, so as to take timely intervention measures.
For adolescents who are already overweight and obese, Ding Gangqiang suggested that, in addition to actively and scientifically arranging meals and exercise, adolescents are at a special physiological stage. They should avoid the use of hunger or semi-hunger therapy to control and reduce their weight, and should not blindly take weight-loss drugs.
Sept 28 (Reuters) - Facebook (FB.O) said on Friday that hackers stole digital landing codes, giving them access to nearly 50 million user accounts, unprecedented in scope and the worst security breach in its history.
Facebook, which has more than 2.2 billion monthly users, said it had not determined whether the attackers had misused any accounts or stolen personal information.
The company also didn't find the location of the hackers, and wasn't sure if the hackers were targeting specific victims.
Its preliminary analysis revealed that it was a large-scale attack.
Chief Executive Zuckerberg called the incident "really serious" in a media conference call.
A spokeswoman for the company said his account, as well as that of Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, were also affected.
Facebook shares fell 2.6% on Friday, dragging down Wall Street's main stock index.
U.S. lawmakers said Friday that the attack may intensify calls for data privacy legislation.
"This is yet another sad piece of evidence that Congress needs to act to protect the privacy and security of social media users," Democratic Senator Mark Warner said in a statement.
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Commissioner Rohit Chopra tweeted,'I hope to get answers on Reuters' coverage of this security breach.
CNN Changsha September 30 (Zheng Yuliang Tian Can) September 30 is China's fifth Martyrs' Day.

"The veterans of the war of resistance are the witnesses of China's war of resistance. They are the real, vivid and vivid teaching materials of patriotism."
Liu Xiao, former vice chairman of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said that the patriotic spirit of the veterans of the Anti-Japanese War is a valuable spiritual treasure for the contemporary Chinese.
Zhu Jianjun, vice chairman of the Changsha Municipal Committee of the People's Political Consultative Conference and chairman of the Changsha Municipal Committee of the People's Republic of China, pointed out in his speech that in recent years, the "Care for the Anti-Japanese War Veterans" project has become an excellent brand in the social service work of the Changsha Municipal People's Revolution by providing care services for the anti-Japanese war veterans in the form of living allowance, free old-age pension and free burial.
He believes that the spirit of the War of Resistance can be passed on only if history is engraved in the heart.
At 11 a.m., amid the solemn and heavy music, the people who came to the event stood in awe.
The members of the Tang People's Etiquette Team wore dresses, carried flowers and marched in a neat procession to send off the partners of 10 anti-Japanese war veterans and 4 anti-Japanese war veterans.
People who took part in the event offered floral tributes to the anti-war veterans, and there were many children in the crowd who joined their parents in paying tribute to the anti-war heroes.

On October 1, the Chinese news agency Yichang (Guo Xiaoying Liu Min) officially began to implement the newly revised "Regulations for the Navigation and Dispatching of the Three Gorges-Gezhouba Water Conservancy Hub" (hereinafter referred to as the "Regulations "). After two years of trial operation, the Three Gorges ship lifter was officially unified with the locks.
On the first day of the implementation of the new regulations, the navigation order of the waters of the Three Gorges-Gezhouba is good.
At 2100 hours on September 30, the Yangtze River Three Gorges Navigation Administration issued the first security screening plan, and conducted security checks on 160 ships. A total of 124 ships passed the security check.
At 1400 hours on October 1, the navigation department arranged the first crossing plan after the implementation of the new regulation.
After the implementation of the new regulations, the security inspection plan will be issued once a day at 9:00 a.m. and 21:00 a.m., and the dam-crossing plan will be issued once a day at 14:00 a.m. and 20:00 a.m., making it easy for ships to flexibly arrange the dam-crossing plan.
The Dispatching Regulations have added the principle of "classification control" for the dispatching of ships across the dam. According to the functional positioning of the ship lock and the ship lifter, the priority order of the ship across the dam is clearly defined, and the short-term passenger ship passing through the gate is adjusted to the same priority level as the demonstration ship and the honest ship.
This is also the second anniversary of the pilot operation of the ship lifter. It is officially unified with the ship lock.
And for the first time, the Sichuan River and the Three Gorges Reservoir area large-scale and wide-scale demonstration ships and new energy power boats are also ranked among the priority classes.
At the same time, the Regulation adjusts the "navigable dispatching management waters" from the previous 180 km near the dam to the 541.8 km from the Yunyang Yangtze River Bridge to the Shishou Yangtze River Bridge, and divides the "core waters, near the dam waters, control waters, and dispatch waters ".
This is conducive to the ship's choice of suitable waters to be closed, and to reduce the backlog of ships to be locked in the dam area.
According to the current characteristics of the ship passing through the dam and waiting for the lock, the Dispatching Regulations also put forward the integrity restriction measures such as the cancellation of the declaration of the ship in violation of the regulations, and the 24-hour delay in crossing the dam.
After the storage of the Three Gorges, the navigation conditions in the reservoir area have been improved, and the rapid development of the Yangtze River shipping has been promoted.
The data showed that the annual cargo throughput of the Three Gorges Lock and Gezhouba Lock increased from 34.3 million tons in 2004 to 138 million tons and 140 million tons in 2017, respectively.
In the past two years, 5,767 ships, 162,200 passengers and 1,712,800 tons of cargo have passed through the trial navigation of the Three Gorges ship lift aircraft.
Chen Dongyuan, deputy director of the Three Gorges Navigation Administration, said that the Regulation has a positive effect on promoting the management of the integrity of the crossing gate, maintaining the navigation order of the two dam hubs, relieving the pressure of the ships waiting for the gate in the dam area, and enhancing the navigation capacity.

After being signed and approved by Premier Li Keqiang, the State Council has recently issued the Decision on Further Reducing the Catalogue of Industrial Products Production Licenses and Simplifying the Approval Procedure.
The Decision proposes to further reduce the list of industrial product production licenses, abolish the administration of production licenses for 14 categories of industrial products, and delegate the authority for the administration of production licenses for 4 categories of industrial products to the quality and technical supervision departments of provincial people's governments.
After this reform, the number of products subject to industrial product production license management will be reduced from last year's 38 categories to the current 24 categories.
The Decision makes it clear that simplified approval procedures shall be implemented for the products in the catalogue.
The first is to change the pre-licensing product inspection organized by the license-issuing authority to the product inspection qualification report issued by the qualified inspection and testing institution submitted by the enterprise when applying.
Second, in addition to dangerous chemicals, the product licensed by the quality and technical supervision department (market supervision and administration department) of the provincial people's government shall be subject to post-site inspection. After submitting the application and the product inspection qualification report and making a commitment to ensure the product quality and safety, the enterprise may obtain the production license after passing the formal examination, and then accept the on-site inspection within the prescribed time.
Thirdly, in accordance with the principle of "one enterprise, one license ", when applying for a new license or applying for a new license, a license certificate shall be examined and issued together.
The Decision requires that all regions and relevant departments should firmly promote the work of reducing the catalogue and simplifying the examination and approval procedures.
We will intensify the work of publicizing the commitments of enterprises and on-site review, strengthen the means of credit supervision and restraint, implement the responsibilities of enterprises as quality subjects, and revoke the production license for those who make false promises and do not meet the requirements.
For products that have been removed from the administration of production licenses for industrial products, it is necessary to effectively strengthen the supervision after the event.

The certification standards shall be unified, and the certification and testing items shall be reasonably reduced. In principle, the mandatory certification fees shall be borne by the finance at all levels according to the system.
Support measures should be taken to encourage enterprises to carry out voluntary certification, promote brand building and expand the market.
We should benchmark international advanced standards and promote the quality improvement of industrial products.
give full play to the role of third-party social organizations and ensure the quality and safety of industrial products.
For products that retain the management of production licenses for industrial products, it is necessary to improve the standard system, give play to the advantages of industry supervision, strengthen the responsibility of "who approves and who supervises ", dynamically assess the risks of product quality and safety, timely reduce the catalogue, delegate the authority for examination and approval or turn to certification management.
In September, China's comprehensive PMI ring ratio increased the manufacturing PMI ring ratio fell.
According to the data released by the National Bureau of Statistics of China on the 30th, in September, China ’ s comprehensive PMI output index was 54.1%, higher than the previous month and the average annual value of 0.3 and 0.1 percentage points, indicating that the overall production and operation activities of Chinese enterprises remained stable.
During the month, the manufacturing production index and the non-manufacturing business activity index, which make up the composite PMI output index, were 53.0% and 54.9%, respectively, down one litre from the previous month.
Among them, China ’ s manufacturing PMI was 50.8%, down 0.5 percentage points month-on-month.
Zhao Qinghe said that this month's manufacturing PMI has five main characteristics:
First, the fundamentals of manufacturing industry are generally stable.
Of the 21 industries surveyed, the PMI of 14 industries is in the expansion range. Among them, the PMI of pharmaceutical, special equipment, electrical machinery equipment and other manufacturing industries is at a high operating level above 53.5%, with a fast growth rate.
The second is the small fluctuation of supply and demand.
The production index and the new order index were 53.0% and 52.0%, respectively, down 0.3 and 0.2 percentage points from the previous month. Supply and demand continued to remain buoyant, but the expansion slowed slightly.
The new export order index and import index were 48.0% and 48.5%, respectively, down from 1.4% and 0.6 percentage points in the previous month. The business climate fell to year lows.
Fourth, the cost of purchasing raw materials for enterprises has increased.
The purchasing price index of major raw materials was 59.8%, 1.1 percentage points higher than that of the previous month. The ex-factory price index was 54.3%, the same as that of the previous month. Both were year highs.
Fifth, the operation of large enterprises is robust, and the operating conditions of small enterprises continue to improve.
The PMI of large enterprises was 52.1%, the same as that of the previous month. Since the beginning of this year, the index has always been in the expansion range of 52.0% and above, and both the production index and the new order index have increased month-on-month. This is the main driving force for the manufacturing sector to keep expanding. The PMI of medium-sized enterprises is 48.7%, down from 1.7 percentage points in the previous month, and is in the contraction range. The PMI of small enterprises is 50.4%, up from 0.4 percentage points in the previous month, rising for two consecutive months.
In the same month, China ’ s non-manufacturing business activity index stood at 54.9%, up 0.7 percentage points from the previous month, and rebounded for two consecutive months.
Zhao Qinghe believes that the non-manufacturing industry as a whole continues to maintain a steady and positive momentum of development.
The business activity index of road transport, securities, real estate and other industries continues to be below the critical point, and the total business volume has decreased.
Nagoya, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Bank of Japan President Haruhiko Kuroda said on Monday that the central bank is aware that the long-term implementation of ultra-loose monetary policy could squeeze the profit margins of financial institutions and could destabilize the country's banking system.
But he said that given low inflation and uncertainty in overseas economies, the Bank of Japan needs to maintain its massive stimulus program while keeping a close eye on the pros and cons of its policies.
"The Bank of Japan fully recognizes that under continued monetary easing, the strength of financial institutions will be increasingly affected," Kuroda said in a speech to business leaders in Nagoya.
He said that if financial institutions were more active in taking risks to compensate for the narrowing of profit margins caused by years of low interest rates, there could be turbulence in the banking system in the event of a serious negative shock.
"Although these risks are not significant at present, the central bank will closely monitor the development of the situation and encourage financial institutions to take necessary measures," he said.
Minutes of the Bank of Japan meeting released earlier on Monday showed that at the September meeting, the policy committee of the Bank of Japan discussed the rising cost of long-term easing.
According to the minutes of the meeting, one member said that if the economy continues to expand, "the Bank of Japan will have more room for flexibility in policy in the future."
The minutes of the meeting showed that another member said that given the limitations of the duration of the policy, the committee should discuss how long the Bank of Japan can maintain the stimulus policy.
Kuroda said the Bank of Japan will assess the financial risks posed by the easing policy, while also taking into account the uncertainty surrounding Japan's economic outlook, which may affect global demand due to Sino-U.S. trade frictions and rising protectionism.
"The impact of such issues on the Japanese economy is temporarily limited," Kuroda said.
"But how the problem continues, the impact on Japan's economy is likely to become greater," he added.
"There is a need for continued strong monetary easing, while considering both positive and negative effects in a balanced manner," Kuroda said.
While the downsides of the aggressive stimulus program have increased, such as long-term low interest rates that have eroded the profits of financial institutions, low inflation has forced the Bank of Japan to maintain the program.
The Bank of Japan maintained monetary policy last month; in the face of the risks posed by the end of the global trade war, Kuroda ruled out raising interest rates in the near future.
On June 1, 2018, in Cardiff, U.S., the corporate logo on Tesla electric vehicles.
Under a settlement, U.S. Tesla Motors and its CEO Musk have agreed to each pay a $20 million fine to financial regulators. Musk will also step down as chairman of the company but remain CEO.
The settlement will spell the end of two months of turmoil for Tesla.
The Securities and Exchange Commission's disclosure of the settlement agreement on securities fraud charges on Saturday will be a relief to investors.
Investors had feared the protracted legal battle would only further hit the electric car company, which is still losing money.
The SEC on Thursday sued Musk for fraud, saying its August 7 tweet misled investors.
The tweet said he was considering taking Tesla private for $420 per share and had secured financing.
The SEC said the tweets were actually unfounded and that the market turmoil they triggered was damaging to investors.
Investors and corporate governance experts say the agreement could strengthen Tesla, which has been hit hard by Musk's recent behavior.
Steven Heim, head of asset management at Boston Common, said the settlement should put Musk under more scrutiny and did not take the "devastating" step of driving him out of Tesla.
The asset management company owns shares of Tesla's battery maker Panasonic.
Under the proposed agreement, Tesla would have to appoint an independent chairman, two independent directors, and a board of directors to develop controls on Musk's external communications.
"It is in the best interests of our market and our investors, including Tesla shareholders, for this matter to be resolved quickly on agreed terms," SEC Chairman Clayton said in a statement.
Thursday's allegations wiped about $7 billion off Tesla's market value, which stood at $45.2 billion on Friday, down from GM's $47.5 billion.
In the settlement, the SEC retracted its demand to oust Musk as the company's head.
Many investors said the penalty would be disastrous.
"I think this is the best possible outcome for everyone involved," said Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial Partners, who gave Tesla a "neutral" rating and called the SEC's penalty a "light punishment" for Musk.
"It's important for Tesla that he still serves as CEO."
Neither Musk nor Tesla acknowledged or denied the SEC's allegations in the settlement agreement, and did not immediately return requests for comment.
The settlement agreement still needs to be approved by the courts.
Beijing Morning News (reporter Wang Ping) The Beijing Morning Post reporter recently learned from the Beijing Construction Industry Group that one of the core buildings of the 2019 Beijing World Expo Park, the Beijing World Expo Performance Plaza project, will adopt a multi-color ETFE mosaic membrane structure for the first time. The 5440-square-meter membrane structure will display six colors of deep red, dark green, orange, blue, red and green, and will present the shape of "butterfly wings" under the tension of the cable steel strand.
According to Liu Changbao, the project leader of the Beijing Construction Industry Five Construction Group, the construction area of the performing arts square project is 4,500 square meters, and the total amount of steel used for installation is 1,182 tons. The steel structure roof is supported by 26 cantilevered steel trusses with an umbrella-like arrangement. Under the tension of the cable steel strand, the shape of the "butterfly wing" is presented.
"Overlooking the performing arts plaza from the air, the colorful roof is like a fluttering butterfly passing through the flowers, and the bright colors will not fade with the passage of time and the wind, rain and snow."
Previously, the monochromatic ETFE membrane structure has been widely used in the Bird's Nest, Water Cube and other projects, but the multi-color mosaic ETFE membrane structure is the first in the country.
Reporters learned that because there are very few suppliers in the world with the production capacity of multi-color film structure, every inch of film structure material is very "precious ".
Liu Changbao said that in order to avoid problems such as overlapping and "fighting" at the end of the cable, the "double-fork" cable head structure will also be innovatively adopted, and special fixed plugs will be used to ensure that the "fighting" cable head is in the correct position.
At present, the construction of the 2019 Beijing World Expo Park is under way.
Among them, the International Pavilion Project has completed the hoisting construction of all "flower umbrellas ".
According to the plan, the project will meet the conditions for the exhibition at the end of October.

After countless storms, the sea is still there!
After more than 5,000 years of hardship, China remains there!
Face the future, and China will always be here! "
He pointed out that economic globalization has suffered setbacks, multilateralism and the free trade system have been hit.

The death toll from the powerful earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia's Central Sulawesi province has risen to 420, the official Antara news agency said at midnight local time, citing figures released by Wilem Rampangilei, the head of the country's disaster relief agency.
According to the official, this is only the statistics of the city of Palu, the capital of Central Sulawesi Province.

General Secretary Xi Jinping delivered a very important speech at the private enterprise symposium, injecting firm confidence for the private economy to move to a broader stage.
General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed that "let entrepreneurs unload their ideological baggage and move forward lightly" has aroused strong resonance among the vast number of entrepreneurs and innovation entrepreneurs.
Market vitality comes from people, especially from entrepreneurs, from entrepreneurship.
In the course of 40 years of reform and opening-up, there are thousands of stories of entrepreneurs starting their own businesses and innovation. The growth and growth of the group of entrepreneurs has continuously pushed forward the breaking waves of the Chinese economy.
For some time now, some people in the society have made some negative and skeptical remarks about the private economy.
The so-called "private economy departure theory" "new public-private partnership theory" and other false claims have caused some entrepreneurs' doubts and concerns.
Recently, some private enterprises have encountered many difficulties and problems in their operation and development.
For example, the changes in the international economic environment have had an impact on some export enterprises; the rapid adjustment of the demand structure has brought about the pressure of transformation and upgrading; some policies are not coordinated with each other, the policy effects are superimposed in the same direction, or the working methods are simple, resulting in some well-intentioned policies having the opposite effect, etc.
Various factors are intertwined, the private economy is experiencing difficulties, some private enterprises are facing difficulties in their operations, and entrepreneurs have shown a lot of anxiety.
Against this background, correcting the misunderstandings of understanding, unloading the ideological baggage of entrepreneurs, and making enterprises single-mindedly seek development, and the government single-mindedly promote development, have a bearing on market confidence and development expectations. It has a particularly profound practical significance.
This symposium re-emphasized the important assertion that "the three have not changed ":" The status and role of the non-public sector of the economy in the economic and social development of our country have not changed! "
In recent years, the CPC Central Committee has paid unprecedented attention to the importance of entrepreneurship and the strength of institutional guarantee, from the in-depth promotion of decentralization and the establishment of a power list system to the creation of a legal environment that protects the legitimate rights and interests of entrepreneurs, the creation of a fair and competitive market environment, and the creation of an atmosphere in which the whole society respects entrepreneurs.
The symposium also clearly put forward the policy measures to support the development and growth of private enterprises in six aspects, and launched a series of practical actions dedicated to the "light forward" of private enterprises.
These have given great encouragement to the group of entrepreneurs and given more expectations to all sectors of society.
The fog has been cleared and the policy has been set. The key is to implement it.
It is necessary to continuously create a better development environment for the private economy, help private enterprises to solve the difficulties in their development, and help to realize the transformation and upgrading of China's economy. It is necessary to make entrepreneurs feel fair in market competition, feel safe in legal operation, feel respect in social life, and inspire innovation vitality and creativity potential.
As China's economy enters the process of moving towards high-quality development, it needs more entrepreneurs to display their aspirations. It also provides a greater space and stage for entrepreneurs to exert their creativity.
We have reason to believe that with the further deepening of reform and the removal of obstacles, the private economy will usher in better development prospects and opportunities, and move to a broader stage.

Customs said that in the past, enterprises had to go back and forth to the relevant department's on-site office hall to submit paper applications. The process was long and it was not possible to track the status of the audit in real time.
Now, enterprise users can directly log on to the "Single Window" portal and apply online.

The export of Korean ginseng chicken soup to China has increased by 20 times in 4 years or is related to the increase of empty nest youth - CNN
An analysis of the 20-fold increase in the export of Korean ginseng chicken soup to China in 4 years: related to the increase of empty nest youth
The Yonhap news agency reported on Friday that the export value of Korean ginseng chicken soup to China exceeded US $100,000 last year, a jump of about 20 times from 2013 four years ago.
According to the analysis, this increase is related to the increase in the number of empty nest youth in China, which has led to the hot sale of convenience food, as well as the increase in young people's attention to nutritious meals.
The data was released on the 5th by the Korea Agricultural and Water Production Food Circulation Corporation (aT).
Last year, the export value of Korean ginseng chicken soup to China amounted to US $1003.39 million, with a weight of 21.8.59 million kg, a jump of 20.94% and 3,668.8%, respectively, from 2013.
According to the analysis, the increase in the sales of Korean ginseng chicken soup in China is related to the increase in the number of empty nest young people driving the hot sales of convenience food, as well as the increase of young people's attention to nutritious meals.
As of this year, one-person households in China have passed the 200 million mark, and are expected to increase to 30% of the total population in 2020. Local food enterprises have also launched a variety of convenience foods aimed at the “one-person family ”.
In addition, the analysis also said that bird flu is the biggest factor that hinders the Chinese mainland market of ginseng chicken soup.
According to aT, from November 2016 to April last year, there was an outbreak of avian influenza in South Korea, and the relevant departments banned the export of ginseng chicken soup to China, resulting in a sharp decline in the export volume.
In 2016, the export value of ginseng chicken soup to China amounted to US $840,000. As a result of bird flu, the export value plummeted to US $100,000 last year.

China-Vietnam border estuary port held national flag raising ceremony to celebrate the National Day
"I can't think of such a majestic and spectacular flag-raising ceremony in the border area. It's even more shocking than watching the flag-raising ceremony in the interior."
On the morning of the first day of the month, Mr. Zhang, who traveled from Sichuan to the Yunnan Estuary Port on the Sino-Vietnamese border, and more than 500 troops, resident citizens and Chinese and foreign tourists watched the flag-raising ceremony at the National Gate to celebrate the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
The estuary port is the largest port in the Yunnan section of the Sino-Vietnamese border. It is located in the Hekou County of Honghe Prefecture, Yunnan Province. It is across the river from Vietnam's old market. It belongs to a category of national ports.
With the continuous deepening of the nation's "Belt and Road" construction, as one of the most convenient routes for China to connect Southeast Asia, the flow of entry and exit from estuaries has steadily increased.
At 7:30 a.m. on the same day, the sun just revealed a corner, and the limited area of the estuary port gathered the local people and Chinese and foreign tourists who came to watch the flag-raising ceremony.
At 7:45 a.m., the flag-raising ceremony began on time. The members of the guard of honor at the National Gate of the Estuary Border Checkpoint were in high spirits and escorted the flag to the flag-raising platform with vigorous strides.
After the commander gave the order to raise the flag, the flag-raising hand worked hard to draw an arc. The bright five-star red flag stretched out like an "eagle spread its wings ", and rose slowly along with the soaring melody of the national anthem.
"Holding the National Day flag-raising ceremony at every New Year's Day, Spring Festival, National Day and other time nodes of great significance not only shows the image of China, but also inspires the patriotic feelings of people of all ethnic groups in the border areas."
So said the honor guard who attended the flag-raising ceremony.
It is reported that the national guard of honor responsible for the flag-raising ceremony at the estuary port is composed of more than 40 officers and soldiers from various posts at the estuary border checkpoint. From a three-person flag-raising team to a large-scale guard of honor, this team has experienced a history of more than 60 years. Since its establishment, it has carried out more than 70 ceremonial duties for national foreign affairs activities.
The newly revised personal income tax law adjusts the criteria for the determination of Chinese individual income tax resident taxpayers from one year to 183 days.
The relevant person-in-charge of the Ministry of Finance of China and the State Administration of Taxation said on the 30th that, in order to maintain policy stability, the next step in implementing the new personal income tax law will be to consider continuing to make preferential arrangements for people from abroad, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
The person in charge said that the current regulations for the implementation of the Individual Income Tax Law have special preferential provisions on the tax payment of people from abroad. Individuals who have no residence within the territory of China but have lived for more than one year but less than five years may pay individual income tax only on the part paid by units or individuals within the territory of China for their income derived from outside China.
It is not necessary to pay individual income tax within the territory of China for the part paid abroad.
The Ministry of Finance of China, the State Administration of Taxation, the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Commerce also issued a notice to expand the scope of application of the policy of withholding income tax for foreign investors to allocate profits for direct investment.
The scope of application of the policy of withholding income tax on profits distributed by foreign investors from resident enterprises in China for domestic direct investment shall be extended to all projects and fields that are not prohibited from foreign investment.
During the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, all parties released some positive messages on the Korean Peninsula issue.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in relayed the North's "irreversible" resolve to abandon nuclear weapons and said that US President Donald Trump and North Korean supreme leader Kim Jong-un may meet before the end of this year.
The U.S. State Department later said that Secretary of State Pompeo will visit North Korea in October to promote the implementation of the promise of the Singapore meeting between the leaders of the United States and North Korea.
From the beginning of this year to the present, the two Koreas have broken the ice and opened the way for dialogue. The leaders of the two Koreas and the DPRK and the United States have met. The general trend of de-escalation of the situation on the peninsula has continued, and the principle of dialogue and settlement of the peninsula issue has also been upheld.
First of all, the point that "the essence of the peninsula issue is a security issue" has not changed. The key to achieving peace on the peninsula is to properly and balancedly address the legitimate security concerns of all parties, rather than putting pressure on each other and emphasizing the demands of their own side.
Secondly, in the dialogue on realizing the denuclearization of the peninsula, the parties concerned are still divided on the steps and ways to achieve the denuclearization of the peninsula. Because of the long-term lack of political trust between the DPRK and the United States, the game thinking of "who comes first and who comes after" is still strong.
At the recent open meeting of the Security Council on the Korean Peninsula issue held at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, the different voices of all parties around the issue of sanctions against the DPRK once again highlighted that the two points on the peninsula issue "have not changed."
US Secretary of State Pompeo insisted that sanctions against North Korea will not be lifted until the complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is achieved.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, on the other hand, stressed the principle of "action in response to action ", noting that" the weakening trend of sanctions should be the same as the steps taken by North Korea on the path of gradually abandoning nuclear weapons. "
There is no doubt that the parties concerned should continue to implement the Security Council resolutions concerning the DPRK in a comprehensive, complete and accurate manner. However, pressure is not the goal. The implementation of sanctions and the promotion of a political settlement are the requirements of the Security Council resolutions. The two should not be left to one side or the other.
As Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, in view of the current positive developments in inter-Korean and inter-Korean relations, China believes that it is necessary for the Security Council to consider the timely launch of reversible provisions, so as to encourage the DPRK and relevant parties to take greater steps towards denuclearization.
In retrospect, the denuclearization of the peninsula and every progress in the peace process will require all parties to show sufficient political courage.
At present, in the face of the ever-higher expectations of the international community to promote a political solution to the peninsula issue, the parties concerned should, in particular, demonstrate political courage, make political decisions, implement commitments, resolve difficult issues, continue to make progress towards each other, and simultaneously promote the process of denuclearization of the peninsula and establish a peace mechanism on the peninsula, and jointly create a permanent peace on the peninsula.
The People's Government of Ji County, Linfen City, Shanxi Province, reported on Monday that during the National Day holiday, the Hukou Waterfall scenic area of the Yellow River, located in the county, will maintain a relatively high water level and do not have the conditions for opening.
In order to ensure safety, the scenic spot was temporarily closed during the National Day holiday.
Hukou Waterfall of the Yellow River is the second largest waterfall in China and the largest yellow waterfall in the world.
As the Yellow River flows to this point, the stone walls on both sides of the river stand steeply, and the mouth of the river is narrow as the mouth of a pot, forming the spirit of "a pot of thousands of miles of Yellow River ".
According to the reporter's understanding, June-October is the flood season of the Yellow River every year. From July 12, 2018, due to the high water level of the Yellow River, the Hukou scenic area of the Yellow River in Shanxi Province began to be closed, so the Hukou scenic area has been closed for nearly a month.
Ni Yufeng, chief engineer of the Hukou Scenic Area Management Committee, told the media that this is the longest extension of the high water level of the Yellow River in the last 20 years. "It has not been closed for so long before. In 2017, the closing time of our flood season is four days, and this year is nearly one month."
It is understood that the Hukou Waterfall Scenic Area of the Yellow River in Shanxi Province was originally intended to welcome the "11th" Golden Week. It also increased the staff arrangement and vehicle maintenance in advance, and even the hiring of temporary staff has been put in place.
According to the "Notice on Doing a Good Job in Flood Control of the Yellow River during the National Day" issued by the "Office of the General Command for Flood Control and Drought Control of the Yellow River ", Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan and Shandong Province are required to do a good job in the flood control work of the Yellow River during the National Day.
At present, the river flow of the Yellow River is relatively large. The upstream channel flow is maintained at 2,000-3000 cubic meters per second, the middle channel flow is maintained at 2,500-3500 cubic meters per second, and the downstream channel flow is maintained at 3,000 cubic meters per second.
Influenza vaccination services are provided at health centres and health posts, especially during the National Day holiday.
The Health Bureau ordered 150,000 doses of the four-price flu vaccine for 2018-2019 this year. At this stage, priority is given to high-risk people to be vaccinated free of charge. In order to facilitate residents to get the flu vaccine during the holidays, the health centers and health stations under the Health Bureau will provide vaccination services from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. during the National Day holiday (October 1 and 2).
In addition to the above convenience measures, the health centres and health stations under the Health Bureau have extended the influenza vaccination service from Monday to Friday to 8 p.m. since the launch of the scheme. As of 4 p.m. on September 30, 4,158 people have been vaccinated, up from 3,714 in the same period last year.
The free vaccination targets include the following Macao residents: persons aged 6 months to under 18 years, persons aged 50 years and over, pregnant women, all patients with chronic diseases, including obese people (i.e. those with a BMI of 30 or above), as well as staff of institutions, nurseries, kindergartens, primary schools and secondary schools, all health workers, and Macao residents working in gambling and entertainment venues.
At the same time, other personnel whom the Health Bureau deems necessary to be vaccinated, including the public sector, will contact the relevant agencies on their own initiative to arrange the vaccination by the health center after obtaining the list.
In order to facilitate the vaccinators and reduce the waiting time for vaccination, the Health Bureau will send medical staff to local secondary schools, primary schools, kindergartens and nurseries between October and December this year to vaccinate children, young and middle school students, teachers and staff. In addition, the Health Bureau will also arrange for staff to carry out group vaccinations in elderly and disabled homes, public departments or other institutions with a large number of people.
Students and young children who cannot participate in the mass vaccination can be vaccinated at the vaccination station or health center of the Count of Ren General Hospital from December 3, 2018 on the basis of Macao resident identity card, health board user card, influenza vaccination card (if any), student card, employee card or occupational certificate.
The Health Bureau reminds residents that between September 2017 and August 2018, people who have been vaccinated against the 2017 to 2018 flu will still need to be vaccinated against the new season of flu from September 2018. As the influenza antigen component of the 2018-2019 northern hemisphere flu vaccine has been updated, it is aimed at the northern hemisphere winter 2018-2019 and the summer 2019 seasonal flu.
The peak flu season in Macau generally occurs in January to March of each year, later than in temperate regions (such as northern China and Japan). The Health Bureau calls on the elderly, children, pregnant women, obese people and chronic patients who are at high risk of complications after contracting the flu, as well as those who are in frequent contact with high-risk people, to be vaccinated as soon as possible.

On the evening of the 29th, the reporter learned from the propaganda department of the Qingbaijiang District Committee of Chengdu City that on the evening of the 29th of September, Beijing time, a column of Central European Banlie (Chengdu) loaded with goods such as automobile connectors, binoculars and liquid crystal display screens was changed through the Shemianufka port in Poland, transferred to the customs, and finally arrived at Nuremberg, Germany.
This is the first time that China-EU Banlie has opened the Shemianufka port line in Poland. It marks the successful opening of another European transport line after China-EU Banlie and Jop.
The trip to Central Europe began on September 14 at the Qingbaijiang City Station in Chengdu. It left the country via the Alashan Pass, entered Europe via the Shemianufka Port in Poland, and finally arrived at Nuremberg, Germany, for a total of about 16 days.
For the first time, the China-EU class trip will carry out the shift operation of the class wide rail and the standard rail here.
The opening of this port has effectively solved the long-term operation and long-term problems caused by the current congestion at the Mara Port, and raised the time limit for class transport. It has also provided a new solution to the problem of congestion at the Mara Port. It has further enhanced the carrying capacity and transport efficiency of the hinterland of western China to the Euro-Mediterranean market, and laid a solid foundation for the development of the European market in China and Europe.
More than 400 people have been confirmed dead after a 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday, many of them swept away by the tsunami waves triggered by the earthquake.
Authorities expect the total number of deaths to increase significantly on Sunday as new figures are reported in remote areas.
Dozens of people are still reported to be trapped under the rubble of a hotel and a shopping mall in the city of Baru.
Waves as high as six meters (20 feet) caused by the earthquake hit the city of Baru.
So far, only the death toll has come from Baru. The death toll in Dongla, north of Baru, has been slow to report, and authorities are preparing for a worse situation.
With a population of 300,000, Dongla is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
Indonesia's Vice President Kara said the total number of deaths could rise to thousands.
Hundreds of people gathered at the beach to celebrate the holiday when the huge wave hit the coast at dusk on Friday. Many people were swept away by the huge wave and everything was destroyed wherever it went.
TOKYO, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Confidence among Japan's big manufacturers hit its lowest level in more than a year in the September quarter, according to the Bank of Japan's short-term survey quarterly report released on Monday, as rising raw material costs and a series of natural disasters affected production, putting pressure on companies.
The survey showed little evidence that escalating global trade frictions have dampened the confidence of large manufacturers.
But the risk of a full-blown trade war has hit the business outlook of companies and could threaten their capital spending.
Active capital spending is a bright spot in Japan's economy.
The survey calls into question the Bank of Japan's view that a robust economic expansion will help accelerate inflation to the 2% target, despite signs that companies are gradually shifting costs to customers.
"Amid fears of a global trade war, the confidence of manufacturers tends to stagnate due to slowing exports and weak factory production," said Nan Wuzhi, chief researcher at the Institute of Agroforestry.
"Confidence is still high. And because corporate profits are improving and prices are rising, I don't think confidence will continue to decline."
A short-term survey showed that the large-scale manufacturing business sentiment judgment index fell to positive 19 in September from positive 21 three months ago, marking the third consecutive quarter of deterioration.
The market's median estimate is positive 22.
The large non-manufacturing business sentiment index fell to positive 22 in September from positive 24 in the June survey, the first deterioration in eight quarters.
The Reuters survey was positive 22.
The survey showed that both the large-scale manufacturing and non-manufacturing business sentiment indicators were expected to remain stable in December.
Investors did not care about the decline of the short-term business sentiment judgment index. The Japanese Nikkei .N225 rose to a 27-year high on Monday, as the continued depreciation of the yen helped improve the export earnings prospects of Japanese companies.
Capital expenditure is sound.
Despite the decline in business confidence, the latest short-term outlook highlights the robustness of corporate capital spending plans, thanks to the renewal of capacity and increased investment in robotics and automation to cope with the labor shortage caused by an aging population.
According to a short-term survey by the central bank, large enterprises plan to increase their capital expenditure by 13.4% in the current fiscal year ending March 2019.
At the time of the previous short view survey, it was 13.6%.
Nanwuzhi said that the capital expenditure plan of all enterprises grew by 8.5% in the current fiscal year, close to the pace of Japan ’ s bubble economy era.
"There is still room for further growth in capital spending, given that small businesses have raised their profit estimates from now on, but much depends on the impact of the trade war on business confidence," he said.
The short-term survey shows that the ability of enterprises to pass on costs has increased. The output price index of large enterprises is positive 7, which is a ten-year high. This is an encouraging sign, reflecting the progress of Japan's efforts to fight deflation.
The index measuring the employment status of large enterprises hit minus 23, the tightest level since 1992, highlighting the tightening of the employment market.
Thanks to robust corporate spending, Japan's economy rebounded in the second quarter from a contraction in January-March this year.
But the escalation of trade frictions in the summer and the disruption of the supply chain by natural disasters have clouded the prospects of the export-dependent Japanese economy.
In dollar terms, the growth rate of services imports and exports is 16.4%.
A press release on the website of the Ministry of Commerce quoted the head of the Department of Service and Trade as saying that the total import and export of emerging services exceeded 1 trillion yuan in January-August, and the growth rate was faster than the overall rate.
Among them, the total import and export of emerging services amounted to RMB1,138.39 billion, an increase of 20.9%, which was higher than the overall growth rate of service imports and exports of 10.4 percentage points, and boosted the share of emerging services by nearly 3 percentage points.
In terms of services exports, in January-August, services exports continued the rapid growth momentum of this year. The export growth rate was 5.7 percentage points higher than the import growth rate.
Among them, the top three areas of growth are telecommunications computer and information services, personal culture and entertainment services, and insurance services, with growth rates of 61.1%, 38.8% and 26.5%, respectively.
The head of the Department of Trade and Services also pointed out that the share of new services imports in January-August also gradually increased.
In January-August, the import of emerging services grew rapidly, accounting for 23.6% of services imports, an increase of 1.6 percentage points over the same period last year.
Among them, imports of financial services, intellectual property royalties, telecommunications computers and information services all grew by more than 20%, at 47.1%, 23.3% and 23.2%, respectively.

Export transactions amounted to RMB206.494 billion (equivalent to US $29.86 billion), a year-on-year decline of 1%.
From the market point of view, transactions with Japan, the ten ASEAN countries, the BRIC countries and South Korea increased by 74.4%, 11.4%, 7.2% and 2.5%, respectively, while the traditional markets such as the United States, Australia, Canada and the European Union fell by 30.3%, 8.9%, 7.3% and 0.8%, respectively.
In terms of industry, means of transport, machinery and equipment, construction and decoration materials, electronic consumer goods and information products, and sanitary equipment increased by 24.8%, 21.1%, 20.0%, 15.1%, and 7.6%, respectively. Textile clothing and household appliances fell by 13.0% and 6.7%, respectively.
Xu Bing said that, as a barometer and weather vane of China's foreign trade, the situation of the buyers participating in the current Canton Trade Fair and the export transaction data show that China's foreign trade development will still face many uncertain and unstable factors next year.
However, with the in-depth promotion of supply-side structural reform and the recent introduction of policies and measures in the areas of "six stability" by the state and local governments, the new dynamic energy of China's foreign trade development is accelerating and new progress has been made in the diversification of the enterprise market. These are important foundations and powerful conditions for the development of foreign trade.
"Taking all factors into account, it is expected that China's foreign trade imports and exports will maintain a steady growth throughout the year, with further improvement in quality and efficiency," Xu Bing said.
The General Administration of Customs of China announced that exports in US dollar terms rose by 14.5% year-on-year in September, while imports grew by 14.3% year-on-year. The trade surplus in September was US $31.69 billion. The export growth rate and trade surplus in September were the highest since February this year.
Despite the escalating trade friction between China and the United States, China's export performance in September was still significantly higher than expected. The strong external demand, the rush of enterprises to export before the imposition of tariffs by the United States and the depreciation of the RMB exchange rate, or the main supporting factors, also showed the resilience of China's foreign trade. However, the impact of the trade war between China and the United States on confidence and the impact on the industrial chain cannot be underestimated. Analysts believe that the challenges of China's foreign trade may become apparent in the fourth quarter or next year.
According to a Reuters survey, U.S. fund managers recommended increasing their cash holdings in September, maintaining a cautious stance as the United States and China began the latest round of reciprocal import tariffs and the dispute showed no signs of easing.
But according to the 12 fund managers involved in the survey, North America's asset allocation rose to its highest since June 2017, while the UK, the eurozone and especially emerging markets saw their positions fall.
The share of global stock allocation averaged 56.6%, while the share of bonds was 35.5%, basically in line with last month ’ s survey.
Its most obvious change is that the cash ratio rose to 5.1%, the highest since December 2014.
"Some economic data have brought confidence to the market, but the trade war is still the biggest concern, so it's best to be prepared to enter when the market falls back," said a fund manager at a large fund company.
But fund managers still preferred stocks in September, especially U.S. stocks, even though U.S. stocks were considered to be overpriced.
Today, in Shanghai, China's open landmark, the world's first major national-level exhibition on the theme of imports, the China International Import Expo, officially opened in the middle of the year.
An exhibition is like a "window" that enables the world to better understand a city and a country.
Through the "window" of the Expo, people can see that they are moving to a higher level of "open China ". With the help of the" window "of the Expo, they welcome the mutual benefit and win-win situation between the world and China, which is" reform and opening up again ".
"For a country, openness is like breaking a cocoon into a butterfly. Although it will experience pain for a while, it will be replaced by a new life."
General Secretary Xi Jinping's summary of the road to openness points to an important reason for "why China can ".
Looking back on the 40 years of reform and opening-up, China, which dares to plunge into the vast ocean of the world market, has always faced all the risks and challenges with an open attitude, continuously released its endogenous driving force and continuously enhanced its competitiveness.
It can be said that China has effectively interpreted the value and significance of openness with its own tangible achievements.
Standing at a new historical starting point, holding an import-themed exposition is a major decision made by the Party Central Committee, with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, to promote a new round of high-level opening to the outside world. It is a major initiative of China to open its market to the world. It is a practical action of China to support economic globalization and trade liberalization. It demonstrates the strong and clear will that "the door of China's opening will not be closed, but will only be opened wider and wider ".
And the enthusiastic registration of exhibitors from all countries and the "one difficult to find" booth are the biggest affirmation and the best response to China's development of an open economy in a larger scope, a wider field and a deeper level.
More importantly, the current global economic and trade order has reached a crossroads.
Some countries have built a high wall of trade protectionism and retreated to the old path of unilateralism. This has increased the international community's concern about the prospect of free trade, and also added a lot of uncertainty to the warming world economy.
Against this backdrop of the times, the event on the banks of the Huangpu River embodies China's defense of free trade, and enables the world to see China's self-confidence and China's responsibility in opening up the market and sharing the future.
Go your own way, go your own way.
By opening its mind and embracing the world, China has not only vigorously promoted its own development, but also brought surging "China opportunities" to all countries and regions of the world.
In recent years, China has advocated and promoted the joint construction of the “Belt and Road ”, launched the establishment of the Asian Investment Bank, and set up the Silk Road Fund.... China has provided a series of international public goods, provided real export markets, development opportunities and jobs, and allowed enterprises from all countries to ride the“ express train ” of China ’ s development.
The Expo is also such a public product and a large platform for global economic and trade cooperation.
On this platform, more than 3,000 enterprises in more than 130 countries and regions have taken a new step in the Chinese market by shining onto the scene with high-quality products and services with various characteristics.
In addition to enterprises in various countries, domestic consumers are also the real beneficiaries.
By building this platform of "Optimal and Optimal Progress ", it provides a multi-channel high-quality supply for consumption upgrading and meets the people's individualized, diversified and differentiated consumption needs.
As the door of China's opening to the outside world opens wider and wider, goods will flow freely, goods will be used to the best of their ability, and the step towards a better life will be more solid.
From a more macro perspective, the significance of the Expo has gone beyond the scope of economy and trade. Rather, it looks to the future, conveys the concept of openness, inclusiveness, inclusion, balance and win-win, and forms a consensus to jointly address today's challenges.
If the world is good, China can be good; if China is good, the world is better.
We expect that the Expo will bring the world a wonderful and complete future. We are more hopeful that we will move to a higher level of "open China" and join hands with the world to build a glorious future of a community of human destiny.
Foreign media: The U.S. and Canada reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
[Abstract] The agreement includes Canada opening up its dairy market to the United States, and the United States temporarily not imposing tariffs on Canadian-made cars.
According to foreign media, a Canadian source revealed on the night of September 30, local time, that the United States and Canada have reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
It was revealed that the agreement included Canada opening up its dairy market to the United States, and the United States temporarily not imposing tariffs on Canadian-made cars.
On the 27th of last month, the United States and Mexico announced that they had reached a preliminary agreement in principle on updating the North American Free Trade Agreement. However, the United States and Canada failed to reach an agreement before the August 31 deadline set by the United States to extend the negotiation period to September 30.
Earlier, a spokesman for Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland said that Canada would only sign a favorable agreement, "focusing on the substance, not the timetable. We will continue to consult and hope to reach an agreement that is in Canada's national interest."
More than 90% of Brazilian women voters said the presidential candidate did not take into account the needs of women.
According to data released recently by the National Geographic Institute of Brazil (IBGE), more than 90% of Brazilian women do not believe that presidential candidates take into account the needs of women, according to the South American Overseas Chinese News Network.
According to the report, the number of women in Brazil has reached 107 million. If all Brazilian women are brought together to form a country, the country's population will rank 13th in the world, more than twice that of Spain's entire population.
In Brazil, the number of female voters accounts for 52% of the total number of voters, with men accounting for 48%. Although the proportion of women in the electorate is very high, in the Brazilian Congress, women account for only 10%.
Among the world's 193 countries, Brazilian women's participation in politics is ranked only 154th, higher than that of Arab countries.
After more than 20 years of struggle for rights, Brazilian women still haven't succeeded in obtaining their due rights.
Natalia Mori, a Brazilian sociologist, pointed out that the reason for this phenomenon lies in the combination of ancient patrilineal society, racism, and capitalist values.
"Politics is supposed to consist of citizens claiming civil rights, identity, access to public goods and the formation of the same society by multiple social groups. But Brazilian politics is the monopoly of one group, and most of the population is not represented."
A previous study conducted by Locomotiva also pointed out that 94% of Brazilian women do not feel that elected politicians can represent their rights, 90% of Brazilian women do not agree with the decisions made by politicians, and 93% do not agree with the current government policy.
"We need to reverse the underrepresentation of women in parliament. Brazil's political system is still affected by inequality. So far, there is still serious gender, class and racial discrimination in Brazil's political sphere," said Natalia Mori.
Despite the lack of women's rights, most Brazilian women still believe in the power of democracy.
The survey showed that 76% of women think they can make a difference in democratic elections, and 72% are interested in politics.
In addition, 55% of women believe that democratic politics is the best way to subject women to less prejudice.
The Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan held a solemn flag-raising ceremony on October 1 to welcome the 69-year-old birthday of New China.
All the members of the Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan, news agencies in Kazakhstan, financial institutions, Chinese-funded enterprises, overseas Chinese, Confucius Institutes and representatives of foreign students attended the event.
On October 1, the Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan held a flag-raising ceremony to welcome the 69-year-old birthday of New China.
After the flag-raising ceremony, Chinese Ambassador to Kazakhstan Zhang Xiao said that on the occasion of the 69th birthday of the great motherland, we held a solemn flag-raising ceremony in a foreign country, which was a profound patriotic education activity.
Although we have been living overseas for a long time, we are always committed to the great motherland.
Zhang Xiao said that the Chinese nation is closer to achieving the great goal of national rejuvenation today than ever before and closer to the center of the world stage than ever before.
"Our mission, responsibilities and work are more glorious, difficult and onerous than ever before."
Zhang Xiao stressed that we should not forget our original intention, keep our mission in mind, promote the joint construction of the "Belt and Road" between China and Kazakhstan to be stable, far-reaching and realistic, draw a more beautiful "Belt and Road" and "Gongbi Painting ", and devote all our strength to the development and construction of the motherland and the friendly cooperation between China and Kazakhstan.
The T2 terminal of Guangxi Guilin Liangjiang International Airport was officially opened on the 30th.
Zhao Leqin, secretary of the CPC Guilin Municipal Committee, said that after the opening of the new terminal, it can meet the annual passenger throughput demand of 12 million passengers, and build a new advantage in Guilin air traffic. It is of great significance to further improve the modern three-dimensional transportation pattern of the "four-in-one" of Guangxi's river-sea linkage, sea-rail connection, land-and-sea connection and air-port connection.
This year Guilin is expected to receive more than 90 million visitors.
The expansion project of the T2 terminal and the supporting facilities of the station at Guilin Liangjiang International Airport is a major public welfare project for the 60th anniversary of the founding of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. It is also a landmark project for the construction of Guilin international tourist resorts.
The project started in December 2015, with a construction area of 100,000 square meters and a total investment of RMB3.258 billion. Upon completion and commissioning, the project will meet the needs of 12 million annual passenger throughput, 10.12 million flights and 95,000 tons of cargo and postal throughput.
On the same day, more than 200 flights took off and landed at the T2 terminal of Guilin Liangjiang International Airport.
The design of the new terminal building is inspired by the mountains and waters of Guilin. It looks like a "mountain and water crown" from afar. It looks like the "dragon ridge terraces" and the tiered eaves of the folk houses of northern Guangxi. It is in harmony with the mountains and waters of Guilin.
According to the report, the new terminal of Guilin Airport can meet the peak flow of nearly 4,000 arrivals and departures per hour. It has applied intelligent baggage sorting system, security integration platform, face recognition and other "smart airport" technical means, and has planned a business district that covers a wide range of industries, including catering, department stores, tax exemption and leisure and entertainment.
As growth in Europe, Asia and emerging markets has mostly been less than encouraging, the US has increasingly become the main engine of global economic growth.
A container freighter moored in the harbor in New Jersey, U.S. September 23, 2018.
But because the current growth in the United States has benefited from the timing of the fiscal stimulus of tax cuts, the country's economy has also come under close scrutiny.
"As the United States is returning to full employment, it is inevitable that the economy will suffer a decline."
The only question, he said, is when it will happen and, in his view, it may only happen sooner rather than later.
While Barclays is optimistic about the outlook for the U.S. economy until the end of this year, the bank acknowledges that it will be more difficult to make forecasts for the longer term.
"In the absence of more sustainable investment growth to boost economic growth potential, current fiscal policy-inspired growth will be unsustainable," Barclays economists said in a research note.
"In the absence of investment growth, the risk of a hard landing for the economy in 2020 will rise," they said.
A series of business surveys will broadly show that major economies are in the economic cycle stage at the end of the third quarter.
The eurozone and US manufacturing survey, due to be released next Monday, will be watched, and the services survey will be released on Wednesday.
But the focus of next week's data is bound to be the U.S. non-farm payrolls data to be released next Friday, which will provide clues as to whether the tight job market is driving significant wage growth.
Its importance is not only because it is important for the profitability of companies and the purchasing power of consumers, but also because the jump in wages or the rise in overall inflation may upset officials of the US Federal Reserve (Fed/FED).
"Pay is going to get a lot of attention because it's likely to go up significantly again month-on-month.
September's rise from a year earlier may not exceed 3%, but we can fully expect a breakthrough next month, "ING economists wrote in a research note.
European politics is likely to be a source of market volatility at a time when holidays in China and other parts of Asia will lead to weak data in the region next week.
The Italian government has ignored its previous financial commitments to the EU, and the rest of the EU will have to quickly determine whether to firmly oppose Italy's decision. Tria does not support the decision and wants to abide by EU rules.
As the Brexit negotiations enter a crucial phase, the annual meeting of the British Conservative Party in Birmingham may also spark.
At the same time, with Brazil ’ s highly anticipated presidential election next weekend, concerns surrounding emerging markets are unlikely to diminish.
[Abstract] When the ship is completed, it will be delivered to the East China Sea Branch of the State Oceanic Administration of China for use. Chen Zhi, Director of the Observation Department of the Marine Early Warning and Monitoring Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China, said that the ship's commissioning will be of great significance for the development of China's offshore ocean observation system and the promotion of global ocean observation.
On September 29, China's first 3,000-ton large-scale buoy ship, the "Xiangyanghong 22 ", was launched at the China Wushu Group.
When completed, the ship will break the current equipment bottleneck of China in the safeguard work of large-scale buoys, submersible marking, recovery, and emergency repair.
The "Xiangyanghong 22" wheel is mainly used for the regular inspection and maintenance of buoys/submersibles, the regular deployment and recovery of buoys/submersibles, the emergency deployment, recovery and repair of buoys/submersibles, as well as the ability to carry out comprehensive marine investigation tasks such as cross-sectional investigation.
The new ship is 89 meters in length, 18 meters in width, 7.2 meters in depth, and has a capacity of 10,000 nautical miles.
Wang Weiling, deputy general manager of the Wushu Group, said: "Xiangyanghong 22 is the first large-scale buoy operation ship in China, and the only working ship in China with the operational capability of lifting ten-meter large buoys. It will further enhance China's large-scale buoy security capability."
It is understood that when completed, the ship will be delivered to the East China Sea Branch of the State Oceanic Administration of China for use. Chen Zhi, Director of the Observation and Inspection Department of the Marine Early Warning and Monitoring Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China, said that the ship's commissioning will be of great significance for the development of China's offshore ocean observation system and the promotion of global ocean observation.
"This ship has both large-scale buoy deployment and maintenance operations, as well as a comprehensive marine survey capability. It is the first comprehensive ship in China dedicated to the operation of buoys in the middle and far sea and comprehensive marine survey.
With such a buoy operating vessel, our ocean observation and ocean investigation will have a powerful tool in the future. "
The first race day of the 2018 International Extreme Sailing Series in Qingdao, scheduled to start on September 30, was postponed to October 1, and a pre-race meeting was held at the Qingdao Olympic Sailing Center on October 1. The captains of 12 hydrofoil catamaran teams from six countries and regions made a full appearance.
Due to the impact of Typhoon "Tam Mei ", strong winds continued in the Hong Kong pool. The maximum wind speed was even as high as 24 knots. The departure signal was delayed by nearly 90 minutes from 1 p.m. on the 30th. The wind speed was still not lowered. The president of the event, Anne Mdrand, announced the cancellation of the first day of competition and postponed the competition to the afternoon of October 1st.
"The strong winds blowing from the shore continue, and the sea conditions are just too intense."
"In this case, no one knows when and what kind of wind the wind is blowing toward the racing boat," Mdrant explained.
Close to the city, with the current wind conditions, canceling the game is the wisest choice. "
It's still a bit of a disappointment for all the crew that's ready.
"The boat is ready to stop, and we're in good shape."
Max Richardson, the helmsman of the Qingdao team, admitted: "But I know that the change of the race is the right choice, and I hope that the wind will be less today, and we will be able to show our hands."
"The loss of a day makes the game more interesting," said Omika Wilkinson, a "star of hope" who is known as the New Zealand team for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
Because the weight of today's game will increase, and there are only two days left to play.
It's going to be especially hard. "
Although the sea breeze was strong, Pierre Eavis Durand, the helmsman of the French ABM team, appealed at the pre-race meeting about his warm-hearted past with Qingdao, where the competition was held: five years ago, the International Extreme Sailing Series accidentally injured himself and broke his muscle. Thanks to the treatment of the local event medical team, he was able to stand at the venue five years later today.
It is reported that the International Extreme Sailing Series was founded in 2007 and is a World Sailing Federation event with the same name as Volvo, America's Cup, World Sailing Against Tour and other events.
The Qingdao race will use "Flying Phantom" hydrofoil catamaran (Flying Phantom).
2018 is the 8th year of the event's landing in Qingdao, the "sailing capital ", and the Qingdao station is also the battle for the series.
Despite the continuing turmoil in the global financial market, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said on Monday that the investment income of the Exchange Fund in the third quarter of this year fell by 97% year-on-year, but was better than the performance of the previous quarter. As a result of the trade war between China and the United States, overseas stocks have soared and foreign exchange losses have narrowed significantly.
According to the latest data of the HKMA, the foreign exchange fund recorded investment income of HK $1.6 billion in July-September 2018, which was significantly lower than HK $61.8 billion in the same period last year, but better than the revised HK $100 million in the second quarter of this year.
Chen Delin, president of the HKMA, said in the Legislative Council that at the beginning of the Sino-U.S. trade war, Hong Kong and emerging market stock indexes ran counter to the U.S. stock index. After the U.S. stock market index peaked in late September and early October, market sentiment began to reverse as investors gradually realized that the trade war was also bad for the U.S. itself.
"A change in market sentiment is a good thing. If a trade war has only one-sided impact, it will do little to help resolve the matter."
But he also pointed out that "if the trade war between China and the United States is not resolved, financial market volatility will continue to rise."
In the third quarter of this year, the stock investment loss of the Exchange Fund in Hong Kong narrowed by 8% to HK $4.7 billion compared to the previous quarter, while the return on overseas stock investment increased by 172% to HK $12.8 billion. The foreign exchange loss of HK $16.2 billion and the bond yield of HK $9.7 billion decreased by 24% and 31% respectively on a quarterly basis, mainly reflecting the general rise of the US dollar against major currencies during the quarter and the rise of US interest rate below 3% in mid-September.
The Exchange Fund is mainly used to support the Hong Kong dollar.
Hong Kong has implemented the linked exchange rate system between the Hong Kong dollar and the United States dollar since 1983.
Regarding the current financial situation in Hong Kong, Chen Delin said that the economic and asset market uncertainties have increased and the downside risks have increased. However, Hong Kong's financial system is sound, it is also well-defended and has sufficient anti-earthquake capability.
"Hong Kong's international investment position is abundant, with a net foreign investment value of US $1.4 trillion equivalent to four times GDP, higher than Singapore's 2.5 times and Japan's 0.6 times. It is more than enough to cope with the downward economic cycle or reversal."
Recently, the Hong Kong dollar interest rate continued to fall and the spread between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar widened. Chen Delin pointed out that the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar rose by more than 400 basis points on September 21. The market generally believed that the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar was mainly related to the rise in the interest rate of the Hong Kong dollar. After that, the Hong Kong dollar hovered around the level of 7.80-7.84. Until recently, the interest rate of the Hong Kong dollar continued to fall. The spread between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar may attract the market to sell the Hong Kong dollar and buy the US dollar. As a result, the chances of the Hong Kong dollar triggering the weak exchange guarantee again are greater than in the previous period.
However, he believes that with the start of the interest rate hike cycle of Hong Kong banks and the normalization of the Hong Kong dollar interest rate, the situation of Hong Kong dollar interest rate below the US dollar interest rate will change in the future.
"The trend of the Hong Kong dollar interest rate and the US dollar interest rate will be more consistent. We must be more careful in managing risks and be prepared to deal with market fluctuations."
As the Hong Kong dollar is very well funded, the Hong Kong dollar interest rate fell further. The three-month interest rate fell 0.9% to 2.08179% on Monday, and the gap with the US dollar rose from 46 basis points to 51 basis points. The one-month interest rate hit a five-month low, and the gap with the US dollar widened from 120 basis points to 127 basis points.
From May to mid-September, the spot exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar was close to US $7.85 for most of the time.
During the period, due to factors such as arbitrage activities and the outflow of some of the capital from the Hong Kong dollar after the completion of the large-scale IPO activities, the weak party exchange guarantee was triggered several times in May and August after being first triggered in April.
The HKMA purchased the Hong Kong dollar and sold the US dollar at the level of 7.85 in accordance with the linked exchange rate system to maintain the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.
In May and August, the HKMA bought a total of about HK $52.1 billion under the weak exchange guarantee mechanism.
Is the new tax law still preferential for people outside China?
In response to a reporter's question on the 30th, the relevant heads of the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation said that in order to maintain policy stability, the next step, when implementing the new personal income tax law, will consider continuing to make preferential arrangements for people from abroad, including those from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
A reporter asked that the newly revised personal income tax law adjusts the judgment standard of Chinese individual income tax resident taxpayer from one year to 183 days.
Will there be any preferential arrangements for overseas people, including those from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, when implementing this law next?
In response, the person in charge said that the current regulations for the implementation of the Individual Income Tax Law have special preferential provisions on the tax payment of people from abroad. Individuals who have no residence in China but have lived for more than one year but less than five years may pay individual income tax only on the part paid by units or individuals within China for their income derived from outside China.
The person in charge said that in order to maintain policy stability, the next step in implementing the new personal income tax law will be to consider continuing to make preferential arrangements for people from abroad, including those from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
There is no "threshold" of the moon child center: quality certification promotes quality improvement.
With the pull of the "two-child economy" and the prosperity of the mother-and-child market, from the north to the third- and fourth-tier cities, various grades of monthly clubs have sprung up all over the country.
The monthly meeting house, which is very hot at the moment, has met the consumer demand of the masses, with fees ranging from tens of thousands of yuan to hundreds of thousands of yuan. However, it is also in an awkward position. So far, there is no threshold for this institution, and there is still a gap in supervision.
The State Administration of Market Supervision recently launched the 2018 National "Quality Month" series of activities. Journalists came to a five-star monthly center in Tianjin to visit the certification experience of mother-and-child care services.
The general monthly child center provides services such as newborn care, nutritious meals, and post-natal repair and shaping.
At this monthly child center, the reporter saw that the nurse checked the nursing situation of the newborn every day, and the professional nurse provided the fine nursing services such as bathing and touching for the newborn.
At the same time, in order to meet the needs of new mothers, from the wound care at the beginning of the month, to the beauty and body care at the middle and later stages of the month, to provide nursing programs such as traditional Chinese medicine treatment and beauty care, and help mothers to recover their fair bodies.
A new mother who lives in the house told reporters that she had booked into the monthly meeting house eight months in advance.
The service items of the monthly clubhouse have a direct impact on the comfort level and physical recovery of the pregnant women during the month. Some small-scale monthly clubhouses can only provide some simple monthly services. There are hidden dangers such as irregular disinfection and hygiene, easy cross-infection, and unscientific diet.
The person in charge of this monthly center said that they are the only one of all five-star monthly centers in Tianjin that has received B-level service certification.
"Although some customers didn't understand the meaning of B-level certification at first, it is important for the long-term development of the enterprise to force the strict and standardized process management of the enterprise to benefit the customers through certification," he said.
Pan Lifen, deputy director of the certification and supervision department of the State Administration of Market Supervision, said that service certification is a new certification system based on customer perception, attention to organizational quality management and satisfaction of service characteristics. It is an important component of the national quality infrastructure. It plays a positive role in raising the proportion of quality service supply and enhancing the international competitiveness of China's services.
China started in 2004. After more than 10 years of development, the service certification program has gone through a process of gradual development from scratch. A number of influential service certifications such as financial service certification, mother and child care service certification, commodity after-sales service certification, e-commerce service certification and health care service certification have emerged.
According to the statistics of the State Administration of Market Supervision, at present, there are more than 130 state-owned service certification institutions, more than 2,000 service certification personnel, and nearly 8,000 valid certification certificates.
Pan Lifen said that it is necessary to further guide and promote the development of service certification, gradually expand the coverage of service certification in the fields of health, education, sports, finance and e-commerce, and promote the supply-side reform and quality improvement of the service sector.
HONG KONG, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Hong Kong property prices have fallen for two consecutive months after peaking. Hong Kong Monetary Authority Chief Executive Chen Delin said on Monday that it will take time to see if the property market has entered a downward cycle. If confirmed, the tightening policy of counter-cyclical measures can be considered in due course.
Chen Delin also pointed out that if property prices were to fall back, the first people to be affected would be those who bought property at the peak of the property market. However, it is expected that there will be a sharp fall in property prices during the Asian financial crisis in 1997, and the opportunity for the public to sell property at sharply reduced prices will be much lower.
Chen Delin, who led a number of senior members of the HKMA at the Legislative Council briefing, said that if it is confirmed that the property market has entered a downward cycle, measures can be relaxed in due course.
"However, we have only seen a few weeks of data. It is still too early to relax. We still need more time to see if the housing market has entered a downward cycle."
Since October 2009, the HKMA has launched eight rounds of counter-cyclical measures to significantly tighten the mortgage of various properties, including reducing the number of mortgages, and requiring mortgage applicants to pass rigorous stress tests to enhance the risk management and anti-seismic capability of banks.
As Hong Kong officially entered the interest rate hike cycle, the private residential property price index in Hong Kong peaked for two consecutive months in August-September. The monthly decline in September widened to 1.44%.
But the cumulative increase in the first three quarters of this year was still 10.2%.
According to the data of the HKMA, the financial situation of households measuring the resilience of Hong Kong to financial risks is still healthy. In the second quarter of this year, the ratio of households living in self-occupied housing without mortgages in Hong Kong reached 66%, which is higher than the average of 60% in 2009-11. The average mortgage yield and the contribution-to-income ratio of newly granted mortgages were 47% and 34%, respectively, a marked improvement from 64% and 41% respectively in 2009-11.
But Chen Delin said that the high earthquake resistance does not mean that people who have already bought property will not be harmed by the economic downturn, because property valuations will fall, and those who buy property during the peak period will bear the brunt.
Although the HKMA has tightened bank lending to mortgage lenders, homebuyers can also obtain a high percentage of mortgage loans through mortgage insurance or mortgage loans provided by developers.
Chen Delin said that at present, together with the mortgage loan provided to the developer, the mortgage rate of the borrower can reach 85-90%. If the property price falls by 10%, there will be negative assets (i.e. the property market value falls below the level of total outstanding mortgage loan).
However, Ruan Guoheng, vice-president of the HKMA, pointed out that the authorities estimate that the total amount of mortgages provided by developers is only 2-2.5% of the total amount of bank mortgages. The proportion is still low.
At the peak of Hong Kong's negative assets in 2003, the number of negative assets exceeded 100,000, accounting for 22% of the total number of people supplying buildings.
As of the third quarter of this year, Hong Kong recorded zero negative assets for seven consecutive quarters.

On November 5 (Zhang Linhu), a man in Liaoning Province killed his lover and left him for dead before absconding to Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region due to a disagreement over money distribution.
On the 5th, the reporter learned from the Dongsheng District Public Security Bureau of Ordos City, Inner Mongolia, that the man was successfully captured after a joint investigation by the police of the two places.
On June 26, 2018, a woman disappeared in Anshan City, Liaoning Province, and her family alerted the local police.
After investigation and investigation by the police, this is not a simple case of missing persons. The missing person, Bai Mou, is likely to be killed by lover Wang Mou. The police immediately set up a task force to conduct further investigation.
On October 30, the task force discovered that the suspect Wang may be hiding in the Dongsheng District of Ordos City. Dongsheng Police immediately organized a competent police force to cooperate fully with the Liaoning police in the detection of the case.
After five days of investigation, the police finally found out the location of Wang Mou, and combed his relations in detail.
On November 4, the police of the two places worked together to capture the criminal suspect Wang Mou in an excavator accessories shop in Dongsheng District.
According to Wang's account, he and the victim, Bai, were lovers. Because Bai's sister had a large sum of money temporarily deposited in Bai's name, the two decided to take the money as their own.

CNN Shenzhen October 1 (Zheng Xiaohong Xu Dianwei Liu Shumeng) October 1 was the first day of the "Golden Week" of the Mainland National Day and the last day of the Hong Kong National Day Public Holiday. Many mainland residents took advantage of the holiday to travel and shop in the country. Many Hong Kong residents who came to Shenzhen returned to Hong Kong on the same day. There was a "pop-up" of passenger flow at the Shenzhen ports. Twenty-two self-service channels were newly opened at the Luohu and Shenzhen Bay ports to enhance the efficiency of customs clearance at the ports and facilitate efficient and speedy customs clearance of passengers.
According to the data provided by the Shenzhen Border Inspection General Station, as of 16 p.m. of the same day, the number of people entering and leaving the Shenzhen Port amounted to more than 429,000, and the number of transport vehicles amounted to more than 16,800 (me, racks, columns). The ports were always busy and not in disorder, and maintained a good order of entry and exit.
It is understood that under the influence of many positive factors, such as the increase in the number of countries providing visa-free exit policies for Chinese citizens, the number of tourists who use the National Day holiday to travel to Europe and Southeast Asia and other countries for holiday shopping has continued to increase.
On the first morning of the first day of the month, the exit direction of Luohu, Shenzhen Bay, Huanggang, Futian and other ports ushered in the peak of passenger (car) flow. Among them, the peak of passenger flow at Luohu Port lasted from 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. and the peak of passenger (car) flow at Shenzhen Bay Port from 6:30 a.m. to 13:00.
According to the report, in order to cope with the peak flow of passengers (vehicles) in and out of the country, the Shenzhen Border Inspection General Station, in accordance with the unified deployment of the National Immigration Administration, started the service mode of passenger (vehicles) flow during peak hours, arranged overtime police to support the first line of duty, opened full inspection channels ahead of time, guided passengers and vehicles to wait for inspection in an orderly manner, and ensured that the queue for entry and exit clearance of Chinese citizens did not exceed 30 minutes, taking into account the efficiency of customs clearance of foreigners; and strengthened the maintenance of order in densely populated areas to ensure the safety and order of customs clearance.
At the same time, the Shenzhen border inspection terminal reminds passengers that they should pay attention to the validity period of their documents, visas and endorsements before travelling, make reasonable arrangements for their travel, avoid the rush hour of passenger flow as far as possible, and choose the right time and the right port to travel.
Passengers travelling to Hong Kong on the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong high-speed railway must hold valid entry and exit documents and visa endorsements. The high-speed rail ticket is only a travel document and cannot be used as an entry and exit document. If they cannot leave the country for Hong Kong due to the non-conformity of the documents and other reasons, they should follow the guidelines of the police on border inspection and duty, and wait for the staff of the MTR Corporation to take them to a designated place to go through the transportation procedures for returning to the Mainland.
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic and difficult disease involving multiple organs throughout the body. It has been considered an "incurable disease" in the past.
Because its pathogenesis is not clear, diagnosis and treatment are difficult, and there is no effective treatment method.
Recently, Liu Wanli, a researcher at Tsinghua University ’ s School of Life Sciences, and Li Zhanguo, director of the Rheumatism Immunology Center of Peking University ’ s People ’ s Hospital, discovered that human immunoglobulin has a molecular mutation that increases susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus, and that this variation is involved in regulating immune B cells.
In short, the two teams confirmed that an abnormal immune molecule in the body is an important cause of the onset of systemic lupus erythematosus.
According to one of the authors of the article, Sun Xiaolin of Peking University People's Hospital, the Li Zhanguo team collected nearly 2,000 cases of systemic lupus erythematosus patients with large samples and conducted research. It was found that the patients with immunoglobulin variation produced a wide variety of disease-causing cells and a large number of autoantibodies. The incidence and severity of inflammation such as nephritis, arthritis, serous inflammation and vasculitis significantly increased.
Liu Wanli's team discovered the immune signaling pathway activated by the mutation of the immune molecule and the pathogenic mechanism of promoting the secretion of multiple autoantibodies by B cells through various research methods such as immune cell tracing, animal testing, sequencing and so on.
Reporters learned that the two teams worked together to give full play to their respective advantages, and achieved a close combination of basic research and clinical application.
Liu Wanli's team is committed to the study of B-lymphocyte immune recognition and immune activation, while Li Zhanguo's team has long been engaged in the clinical study of systemic lupus erythematosus.
"This study is one of the results of many years of cooperation between the two teams. It is also the first time that the academic community has recognized that the abnormal immunoglobulin gene will induce systemic lupus erythematosus. It has laid a solid foundation for further academic research and clinical targeted treatment."
This is not to protect the short, but to do things in accordance with the law.
The lawyer went to court with a hatchet?
The news did sound exciting at first glance, and it also blew up in the legal circle.
Fujian Quanzhou City, China and France subsequently fined the lawyers involved 500 yuan and made a written recommendation to the Quanzhou City Bar Association to investigate and deal with the matter.
According to the Beijing News, the Quanzhou City Law Association issued a formal notice a few days ago saying that the acts of the two lawyers do not involve violations of the law and regulations, and will not be punished according to law.
According to many reports, the treatment of the Quanzhou City Law Association is not to protect the short or engage in confrontation, but has been recognized by the Quanzhou Central Academy.
An incident that could have triggered tensions within the legal community has finally been properly resolved.
The reversal of the matter stems from a more complete restoration of the truth: the axe carried by the lawyer involved is of the same style and the same type as the murder weapon of the defendant, but it has not been opened. It is only used as supporting evidence in the cross-examination of evidence. There is no intention of intimidation or "endangering the safety of the court ".
There are four very important details to be paid attention to in judging whether the conduct of the lawyers involved is illegal or not. First, the local court held two previous sessions and only produced photos of the axe. From the point of view of the defence, it is necessary to show the original object of the axe. Second, the axe was purchased only one hour before the court session. It is not that the lawyer did not want to seek the judge's consent, but objectively failed to contact the judge. Third, the whole axe was not used excessively or improperly. Fourth, the lawyer publicly acknowledged the mistake at the first time and expressed his apologies to the court.
In combination with these circumstances, it can be seen that the lawyers involved "appear in court with axes" have nothing to do with evil, but only for the purpose of defense.
After clarifying the whole fact, the Quanzhou City Law Association did not push the boat along the water, but made a decision not to punish in the face of pressure.
This decision, too, can stand the test of fact and law.
As for bringing the axe, which is used as a control tool, to the court without the permission of the court, it is indeed easy to cause unease and misunderstanding.
For reasons of safety and caution, Quanzhou Intermediate Court's previous fines and judicial recommendations are also justifiable.
In order to safeguard the dignity of lawyers and prevent individual courts from making difficulties with lawyers, the Supreme Law issued the "Rules for the Security Inspection of Judicial Police of People's Courts" in 2014, which established the principle that lawyers do not need to carry out personal security inspection when appearing in court.
Since the rule was issued, the majority of lawyers have led by example, and few incidents have occurred due to security loopholes that jeopardize the security of the court.
In such rare cases as Quanzhou, as long as communication is conducted in the spirit of mutual respect and understanding, misunderstandings are not difficult to eliminate.
As a self-discipline organization of the legal profession, the Bar Association is charged with the dual mission of punishing illegality and safeguarding legality.
In the past, individual legal association organizations have been criticized for emphasizing discipline and failing to safeguard.
And the decision of Quanzhou Legal Association, both in terms of the process and the results, is commendable, setting an example for more legal associations to perform their duties correctly.
From October 1, which tax benefits will affect our moneybag?
Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 1 (reporter Sang Tong) The new personal income tax law will come into effect on January 1, 2019. In order to enable the broad masses of the people to enjoy the tax reduction dividend as soon as possible, from October 1, the actual wage and salary income earned by taxpayers will be deducted at the starting point of RMB5,000 per month, and the new tax rate scale will be applied.
With the landing of the New Deal, what are the benefits that will affect the pocketbook of the masses?
Good for one: the tax reduction on income from wages and salaries is obvious
Taxpayers who have obtained wages and salaries after October 1 can deduct the basic deduction cost of RMB5,000/month and apply the new tax rate scale. Most taxpayers have different levels of tax reduction, especially for low- and middle-income earners.
According to the tax reduction tables of different income groups, the monthly income after deduction of “three risks and one gold ” amounted to RMB 8,000, RMB 10,000, RMB 20,000 and RMB 50,000. The tax payable after tax reform amounted to RMB90, RMB290, RMB1,590 and RMB9090 respectively. Compared with the monthly threshold of RMB3,500, the corresponding tax reduction rates were 73.9%, 61.1%, 49.0%, and 18.8%, respectively.
It is worth noting that due to holiday reasons, the wages that should have been paid in October, which were issued by various units in accordance with the law at the end of September, may be applied to the new basic deduction of fees and tax rates.
For this reason, the withholding client software, which is uniformly popularized by the tax department, has provided the corresponding tax calculation function, but the corresponding tax still needs to be declared and paid within the statutory filing period.
Secondly, the gap between the low tax rates and the tax brackets has increased significantly
In addition to raising the threshold, a new tax rate schedule will be applied from October 1.
The seven-step tax rate of the wage and salary income is the same as before, and has not changed, but there has been a marked change in the range of tax rates. The range of low tax rates of 3%, 10% and 20% has been significantly expanded. The range of tax rates of 25% has been reduced, while the range of higher tax rates of 30%, 35% and 45% has remained unchanged.
It is worth noting that the tax law has also adjusted the various tax rates of income from production and business operations, with the lower limit of the top-grade 35% tax rate raised from RMB100,000 to RMB500,000.
This means that individual businesses and sole proprietorship partnerships will all benefit from the tax reform.
"Judging from the previous calculation of individual tax cuts for Shanghai taxpayers, the vast number of taxpayers will fully feel the dividends of tax reform, especially for low- and middle-income people."
Lan Min, head of the personal income tax department of the Shanghai Municipal Taxation Bureau of the State Administration of Taxation said.
Good for the third: more convenient and optimized tax payment services
Since the promulgation of the new personal income tax law, the Shanghai Municipal Taxation Department has carried out a series of comprehensive and extensive tax publicity actions.
On the one hand, carry out "one-on-one, point-to-point" policy guidance for key tax sources and key enterprises.
The Pudong New District Tax Bureau has visited such large enterprises as Apple Trade (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., Alipay (China) Network Technology Co., Ltd., Hongxing Meikailong Home Group Co., Ltd., which have a large number of employees, a large amount of withholding and payment work, and a large amount of tax payment. The Xuhui District Tax Bureau visited the large labor service enterprises in the region, Zhongzhi Financial Consulting Co., Ltd., and Zhongzhi Shanghai Economic and Technical Cooperation Co., Ltd., to collect the concerns of enterprises in a timely manner, respond to the demands of enterprises, and solve the difficulties of enterprises.
On the other hand, the tax policy of "all-around, multi-dimension and three-dimensional" should be carried out for the general public taxpayers.
Make use of the official Shanghai tax website, WeChat public number, microblogging and other channels to push the policy hot spots in a timely manner to ensure that the policy publicity is in place.
At the same time, since September 28, the Shanghai Tax WeChat Public Number 12366 smart consulting platform has launched a "target-oriented" intelligent integrated tax reform propaganda service through the "artificial + intelligence" tax payment service consultation.
On the evening of November 5, Beijing time, the England Football Association officially announced that former England captain Rooney will return to England's national team for the warm-up match between England and the United States on November 15.
In August last year, Rooney announced his retirement from the England squad.
Rooney has previously made 119 appearances for England, scoring 53 goals, and is the team's all-time leading scorer, with the second-highest number of appearances.
According to the FA website, this match with the United States is to raise money for Rooney's children's charity foundation, and Rooney himself is very excited: "It's a pleasure to play for England at Wembley again, thanks to Southgate and the FA for inviting me to help my foundation.
Playing for England is the greatest glory of my career, the 120th time and will be the last time I play for England. It will be a special memory for me. "
The annual Yangcheng Lake crab cultural tourism festival kicked off on the 30th. According to Gu Wenhua, the party secretary of "Yangcheng Lake hairy crab town ", the annual economic output value of the town's crabs is nearly 3.8 billion yuan, with a net income of more than 600 million yuan.
Yangcheng Lake hairy crab, also known as the golden claw crab, has a reputation as the "king of crabs" because the crab is not mud-stained. It is commonly known as the clear water hairy crab, with a green shell and white belly, and the meat is greasy.
It has become a common practice for people to eat crabs in the golden autumn season with the fragrance of Dangui.
The hairy crab is the most well-known image spokesperson in Bacheng.
Peeling crab shells, sucking crab feet, picking crab meat and dipping crab material, diners feel the beauty of being in the south of the river.
Jinwei, a crab farmer, said that more diners will spend more time in Bacheng this year. On the edge of the vast Yangcheng Lake in Yanbo, they will watch the egrets hunt for food, watch the sunset and the west, experience the fun of catching crabs, and enjoy the slow pace of water life.
As a result of the widespread introduction of large-scale seedlings in the town of Bacheng, the number of hairy crabs coming out of the water this year is much larger than before.
Chang Jianhua, a crab farmer who has been dealing with hairy crabs for nearly 20 years, is planning to export the crab seedlings and breeding technology of Yangcheng Lake hairy crabs to Thailand, so that aquatic food can cross the border and promote cultural exchanges with overseas cuisines.
"Kunqu Town" is a cultural sign of Bacheng.
At present, there are Crab Boat Court, Fisherman's Lights, Spring and Autumn Water Town, Linhu Crab Market, Zhengyi Bajie Crab Market, and a street of gourmet food. There are as many as 1,300 large and small restaurants around Yangcheng Lake hairy crabs doing catering business. There are a lot of different kinds of Crab Boats. The busy traffic at the peak of passenger flow has become a unique scenic route.
Gu Wenhua said that "a crab" attracts nearly 3 million tourists from home and abroad each year, and has also formed a two-way, two-way, lively and fragrant bacheng old street.
A number of tourism products such as the Kunqu theme post office, the concept book bar for picking up paintings, the Fan Mo Baobei theme image museum, the Kunqu theme residence, the embroidery museum, the Qipao museum and many other tourism products have been unveiled. A number of celebrity studios such as the Kunqu scholar Yang Shousong, the flute master Chen Dongbao, the famous Kunqu Xiaosheng Yu Jiulin, the bamboo carving craft master Ni Xiaozhou, and the folk song inheritor Lu Zhenliang have entered. Old Street has become the cultural core area of the "Kunqu Town" of Bacheng.
It is reported that during the Crab Culture and Tourism Festival, the 4th Kunqu Town ・Bacheng Chongyang Festival will also be held once again. Quyou from all over the world will gather together to recapitulate the beautiful scenery of Yushan.
A number of cultural venues, such as the Bacheng Historical and Cultural Exhibition Center, Kunqu Promenade, Ayingya Court, Chongwen College and Kun Opera Theatre, will also be unveiled, presenting the cultural charm of Kunquyuan Township, the home of Chinese calligraphy, and Jiangnan Fish and Rice Water Village.
A three-way trade agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico will bring new opportunities for 500 million people.
According to foreign media reports, the joint statement of Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland and U.S. Trade Representative Lighthizer, published on the Canadian government website, said that the United States, Canada and Mexico reached a three-way trade agreement, which will be known as the "USMCA" (US-Mexico-Canada Agreement).
Earlier, Canada's CTV News television quoted senior U.S. sources as saying that Canada and the United States had resolved their differences and reached an agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
The Washington Post, citing two sources with knowledge of the situation, reported that the agreement reached between the United States and Canada on September 30 will retain the North American Free Trade Agreement as a three-party trade agreement, and the heads of the three countries will sign a new agreement within two months.
"Today, Canada, the United States and Mexico have agreed on a new trade agreement - the USMCA, which will provide a high standard of trade agreement for our workers, farmers and companies. It will lead to freer markets, fairer trading and more sustainable economic growth. The agreement will strengthen the middle class, create high-paying jobs and create new opportunities for about 500 million people," the statement said.
It is reported that the current North American Free Trade Agreement was signed by the United States, Mexico and Canada in 1994.
After his inauguration as president, Trump announced plans to revisit the agreement and sign a new deal.
The three countries began this negotiation process in 2017.
The results of the Okinawa governor's election, which was held ahead of schedule due to the illness and death of former Governor Ong Xiongzhi, were announced in the early hours of the morning local time. Yucheng Danny, who opposed the planned relocation of the US military base in Japan, was successfully elected.
The election was held on September 30. The final result showed that Yucheng received a total of 3966.32 million votes, the highest number of votes in the history of the Okinawa governor's election, and more than 80,000 more votes than his main election opponent, Saki Shinsoon.
A total of four candidates participated in the election, with a turnout of 63.24%, down 0.89 percentage points from the 2014 election of governor of Okinawa Prefecture.
Yucheng told the media on Monday that the election results showed that the county people did not want to let the efforts of Governor Weng before his death be in vain. He will carry on the legacy of Governor Weng and continue to make efforts to the Japanese government and the US government on opposing the relocation plan of the US military base and the closure of the Futenma base.
The U.S. military base of Futenma, located in Yiyewan City, Okinawa Prefecture, has long been criticized. The Japanese and U.S. government had previously agreed to relocate it to the border area of the famous city, but the people of Okinawa strongly opposed it, hoping to move the base out of Okinawa completely.
As for the relocation plan strongly opposed by the county residents and the requirement to revoke the land reclamation permit along the ancient coast of Bianye, Yucheng said that he did not stand in opposition and split with the central government at the beginning. He hoped that the two sides could fully exchange views and showed their intention to resolve the issue through consultation.
Japanese Prime Minister Abe Jinsan also told the media on the morning of the first day of the month that he seriously accepted the result and would make efforts to revitalize Okinawa and reduce the burden of the base.
At a press conference on Monday, Japan's Chief Secretary of State Yoshihide Suga said that there has been no change in the government's policy on moving US military bases as soon as possible.
At the same time, he also expressed his intention to talk with Yucheng.
Yucheng will be officially installed as governor of Okinawa Prefecture on the 4th of this month.
Since the mid-2000s, as China's demand for oilseeds has grown, Paul Thomas, a farmer in North Dakota, has grown more and more soybeans in his fields.
The shift culminated this year, when he planted 1,600 acres of soybeans in 5,000 acres, on a scale never seen before.
But Thomas and many farmers like him plan to switch to the staple crops of the former U.S. agricultural region in 2019: corn and wheat.
U.S. farmers planted more soybeans than corn this year, for the first time in 35 years.
The reason for the plan to switch to other food crops is that U.S. farmers face difficulties selling soybeans against the backdrop of President Donald Trump's trade war against China.
China typically buys about 60% of U.S. exports of soybeans, but the trade war has resulted in almost zero purchases of U.S. soybeans in recent months, causing soybean prices to fall to decade lows.
Thomas intends to grow more wheat next year, hoping to make more money by reducing its dependence on crops that depend on Chinese demand.
Thomas said the price of soybeans "has hit us hard."
Without Chinese demand, he said, the spot price of soybeans near his farm is $7.10 per bushel, while the price necessary to cover the cost is $8.50.
U.S. farmers planted a record amount of soybeans this year, and the harvest is expected to reach a record high.
At such a vulnerable moment, they were hit by a trade war.
In response to Trump's imposition of tariffs on imports of Chinese goods, China imposed import tariffs on imports of American soybeans in July.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture will release its first estimate of next year's planting area, which is expected to include consideration of the impact of tariffs.
It is expected that the estimate will confirm the expectation of the private sector that soybean seeding area will be reduced.
According to a report seen by Reuters, Informa Economics predicted on October 19 that corn acreage will increase by 4% to 92.7 million acres (37.5 million hectares) in 2019, while soybean acreage will be reduced by 7% to 83 million acres.
Informa also expects a 4% increase in wheat acreage in the US.
Soybean acreage planted before the retaliatory tariffs rose to 89.6 million acres this year, some 15 million acres higher than 10 years ago.
Corn acreage has increased by less than 5 million acres since 2008 to 89.1 million acres, and wheat acreage is 47.8 million acres this year, near the lowest level in 100 years.
Aron Carlson, president of the Illinois Corn Growers Association, has a total planting area of 3,600 acres. This year, he spent nearly half of it on soybeans, but plans to cut back in the future.
He said it was possible to increase corn acreage by up to 20% at his farm in northern Illinois, the largest soybean-growing state in the country.
Soybean yield per acre is lower than that of corn, but it also requires less fertilizer, which makes it cheaper to grow soybeans overall.
If farmers switch to final-value corn, it may raise costs, but it will benefit some businesses, including Andersons Inc. fertilizer sellers.
Andersons CEO Pat Bowe told Reuters he expects the switch to corn will benefit fertilizer use.
Bayer is also expected to benefit from farmers switching to maize.
The director of the Langman Airport Authority in Bangkok, Thailand, Sutilawa, held a press conference on the 29th to apologize for the incident in which a Chinese citizen was beaten at the airport, and said that Thailand welcomes Chinese tourists. The relevant departments will strengthen management, enhance service awareness and avoid similar incidents.
According to the report, on the 27th, the security guard of Langman Airport had a physical confrontation with a Chinese man who was refused entry.
Sutilawa said that the behavior of the security guard involved was a serious breach of discipline. The Airport Authority has suspended him and established an investigation committee to investigate the matter in accordance with the procedure. If the matter is true, the security guard will be dismissed.
At present, the Thai Immigration Bureau has arranged for the man to return to China by air.
Sutilawa apologized for the incident, which damaged Thailand's image, and said that Thailand attaches great importance to the matter, is willing to do its best to reduce the impact of the incident on the beaten tourists, and will send a letter of apology to the party through the Chinese Embassy in Thailand.
He said that Langman Airport is willing to provide convenience for Chinese tourists to Thailand and jointly with the Thai Immigration Bureau to set up special entry channels for Chinese tourists at the five major Thai international airports, including Suvarnabhumi, Langman, Chiang Mai, Phuket and Heai in Bangkok.
He said that the next step of the Airport Authority will be to rectify the land signing area, express the cost of land signing, and improve the service quality and communication ability of the staff.
When the Chinese Embassy in Thailand learned of the incident, it made contact with the parties at the first time to find out what had happened.
At the same time, he made representations to the heads of the Thai Immigration Bureau, the Airport Authority and the Ministry of Tourism and Sports, asking the Thai side to thoroughly investigate the incident and severely punish the perpetrators. He will continue to maintain close communication with the Thai side, properly handle the matter and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the parties concerned.
New China International Times Review: Defending Multilateralism, China Knows and acts in one.
At a time when unilateralism is surging against the current, international rules and the multilateral order have suffered a shock.
In a way, the confrontation between unilateralism and multilateralism has entered a critical period.
As a responsible and powerful country, China, with the concept of following the general trend and combining the road, and solid and powerful actions, will work with the international community to jointly safeguard multilateralism and promote multilateralism to move forward.
In the face of the new situation and new challenges, China has issued a loud voice on the development direction and path of multilateralism.
As State Councilor and Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Yi said in his speech at the general debate of the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, multilateralism in the new era should adhere to the goal of win-win cooperation, be based on rules and order, be based on fairness and justice, and be guided by effective action.
At the same time, China calls for the establishment of a global development cooperation pattern with the United Nations as the core, North-South cooperation as the main channel, and South-South cooperation as a complement, and calls on all parties to work together to build a community for the future of mankind.
China's thinking and calls reflect the mainstream voice of the international community.
As President Espinosa of the 73rd session of the General Assembly said, in the current situation, "the United Nations needs to promote multilateralism and uphold the rules-based international system more than ever."
International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde said that the international community should continue to firmly uphold the multilateral trading system, adhere to international trade rules and resolve differences through consultation.
In recent years, with the adjustment of the balance of global economic and political forces, a number of emerging markets and groups of developing countries have emerged, playing a greater role in the major international multilateral mechanisms, and providing a new impetus for the development of multilateralism in the face of headwinds.
From this perspective, the concept of building a large family, rather than cobbling together small circles, and adhering to the concept of multilateralism, such as building a common business rather than a winner-take-all approach, advocated by China, conforms to the trend of the times, is an inevitable choice to meet global challenges and solve world problems, and represents the common aspirations of most countries in the world.
There are advanced ideas and more solid actions.
The "Belt and Road" initiative proposed by China has become the largest international cooperation platform.
China has launched international and regional cooperation initiatives such as the “Belt and Road ”, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and the“ 16+1 Cooperation ” to promote international and regional cooperation, improve and complement the existing international system and order, bring innovative vitality to multilateral cooperation, and contribute to promoting the development of the international order in a more just and reasonable direction.
As a defender of the international order and a practitioner of multilateralism, in the multilateral arena of the United Nations, China's actions have become more and more forceful.
Good offices to international hotspots, address climate change, participate in peacekeeping operations, vigorously reduce poverty and help other countries implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
As UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said, China has become an important pillar of multilateralism.
When the “trust deficit ” facing the world intensifies, when the trend of populism and polarization rises, it is the most urgent time for the world to demand multilateral cooperation.
At such a historic juncture, the international community needs to join hands, turn consensus into action, resolutely defend multilateralism and jointly promote the building of a community of destiny for mankind.

CCTV issued a quick comment on this: This is the first Martyrs' Day after the implementation of the Law on the Protection of Heroes and Martyrs.
Five years ago, the establishment of the Martyrs' Day on the eve of the National Day demonstrated the great journey of the Chinese nation from suffering to glory. We should always be vigilant: "Where we come from, where we go ".
General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that "abandoning the tradition and discarding it is tantamount to severing one's own spiritual lifeblood ".
"Only by not forgetting history can we open up a future."
We advocate heroes and commemorate martyrs, that is, we should always remember the history, continue the heroic spirit, and rally the strong positive energy of the national rejuvenation.
The quick review points out that Ying Li is the backbone of the nation.
To honor the martyrs and sacrifice the martyrs is to make Yinglie a noble, holy and powerful eternal memory in our hearts.
According to incomplete statistics, about 20 million martyrs died heroically for national independence, the liberation of the people, the prosperity of the country and the happiness of the people.
Every martyr who has died for his country will be remembered, and every spirit of loyalty to the country will be looked up to.

The fifth "disabled voice month" comes to pay attention to the issue of sex education for disabled teenagers - CNN
In recent years, the topic of sex education for young people in China has been widely discussed, but the challenge of sex education for young people with disabilities is still very difficult.
Recently, a seminar on the challenges and practical strategies of comprehensive sexuality education for people with disabilities was held in Beijing.
How to carry out sex education for disabled children and young people has become an important topic of this seminar.
The "Report on Sexual Knowledge, Attitude and Behavior of Disabled Children and Youth in China" released at the meeting showed that the proportion of disabled children subjected to sexual harassment and sexual assault is higher than that of healthy children.
For disabled children and adolescents, more attention is also given to "sexual protection" in the society.
The purpose of this seminar is to discuss the promotion of comprehensive sexuality education for disabled children and young people in China from the three aspects of family support, school education and institutional services, and to provide support for disabled children and young people from the source, so that they can enjoy the right to enjoy love freely, just like other people.
Experts believe that, for a long time, the Chinese public's understanding of the disabled has remained at a level that is not sufficiently in-depth.
Influenced by traditional concepts and other factors, China's comprehensive sexuality education for people with disabilities, especially disabled children and young people, is not deep enough.
However, in recent years, with the support of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and public welfare personnel, the practice and implementation path of sexual and reproductive health education for all-round development of people with disabilities in China have made encouraging progress.
The Report shows that children and young people with visual impairment, hearing impairment, intellectual disability and physical impairment may have more difficulties in acquiring sexual knowledge and understanding of intimate relationships than the general population, but on the whole, they have developed towards convenience and enrichment.
The "Seminar on Challenges and Practical Strategies of Comprehensive Sex Education for People with Disabilities" was organized by the Shanghai People's Welfare Foundation, with the joint support of the UNESCO representative office in China, the Beijing representative office of the International League for the Disabled (France) and the representative office of the United Nations Population Fund in China. The aim is to jointly explore the practice and implementation path of sexual and reproductive health education for people with disabilities in the full cycle of comprehensive development in the context of a healthy China strategy, promote the understanding of the international policy of comprehensive sexuality education and the right to health of disabled children and youth by policy makers, educators, researchers, social service organizations, parents' representatives and other stakeholders in the field of special education and inclusive education; and conduct extensive exchanges on the practice, strategies, challenges and resources of sex education for disabled children and youth in China, discuss and draw up a blueprint for future comprehensive sexuality education for disabled children and youth, and form a support network.
BEIJING, Sept 30 (Reuters) - China's central bank on Sunday released data on the expected short-term net outflow of foreign currency assets, showing that the central bank's short positions in foreign currency forward contracts and futures contracts were zero for 12 consecutive months as of the end of August this year. There were still no long positions for the month.
The central bank's previous data showed that as of the end of August last year, the central bank held a short position of US $6,044 million in foreign currency against local currency forward contracts and futures contracts, which was unchanged for the fourth consecutive month. The short position in SDR (Special Drawing Rights) amounted to US $4.276 billion.
Since then, the central bank's foreign exchange forward short position has been zero.
The central bank first released the data at the end of March 2016; the data showed that at the end of February 2016, the central bank had a long position of US $2,438 million in foreign currency against local currency forward contracts and futures contracts, and a short position of US $28.9 billion.
The September data released at the end of October of the same year showed a net increase of $16,401 million to $45,301 million for the first time.
The central bank has previously said that the forward and futures short positions of foreign currencies against local currencies mainly reflect the foreign exchange forward operations conducted by the central bank with commercial banks to meet the needs of enterprises for hedging their foreign currency liabilities, and will continue to provide long-term safe-haven products in accordance with the principle of real needs. The impact of the forward operations of the central bank on the future size of foreign exchange reserves is relatively small.
On the evening of September 20 this year, on the K158 train, Joe, who was a junior in Zhengzhou, took a bus to Hebi.
A great man on the train bought a seatless ticket, but took her seat: "Let's shoot it."
After a two-hour drive, the conductor advised him that an hour was still ineffective.
In the end, a male passenger in the same car couldn't look down and pulled him up.
From the point of view of public opinion, although most of the final result is that the bully is condemned by the public, punished by the public security department, and even included in the integrity blacklist, the public still feels that they cannot "unhate ": why not allow the bully to be punished on the spot?
Why can't they stop their immoral or even illegal behavior on the spot, but only punish them afterwards?
And for the unreasonable behavior of the "master bully ", how is it just a male passenger who" sees the road uneven "and drags him up?
The main reason is that only long-distance trains are equipped with passenger police, and short-distance trains are generally not available. Even if there is a passenger police, the passenger police are more concerned about the possible rogue response of the bully and do not take measures to force the removal.
Repeated incidents of bullying have made people realize that the bully must be forcibly removed or even punished on the spot in order to act as a deterrent.
This requires that our train police should dare to take strong measures in a timely manner. Trains without police should be equipped with police as soon as possible in order to prevent and combat illegal acts in a timely manner.
On October 1, the first day of the National Day holiday, the number of vehicles in the direction of Songpan, Maoxian County, via Beichuan Qiang Autonomous County, Sichuan Province, soared.
At 1300 hours, Beichuan traffic police received a call for help, saying that his family had a traffic accident in Songpan. As the local medical conditions are limited, they are in urgent need of being sent to Mianyang for treatment.
It coincides with the implementation of one-way traffic control on the Tangjiashan Yan Sehu Huanhu Road in Beichuan. I would like to ask the traffic police to release the 120 emergency vehicles.
After receiving the call for help, the police on duty promptly reported the situation to the brigade. After a brief understanding of the situation, Huang Xuemin, the commander of the brigade, immediately arranged for the police on duty at the control point to contact the helper and asked to do a good job in the escort work.
"At that time, there were more than 1,000 vehicles entering the controlled section. After contacting the 120 emergency vehicles, it is expected that the time of arrival in Beichuan will be around 1500 hours. We will arrange the deployment immediately."
Beichuan traffic police Yuli Squadron Leader Gala Wei said that emergency vehicles need to be bypassed from the Tangjiashan Yan Sehu Loop Road, and the road is steep and narrow. In order to prevent the vehicles that have entered the section of the road from driving in parallel, the traffic police will exercise sectional control over the vehicles at the beginning, middle and end of the road one hour in advance, and remind all passing drivers to give way to the side of the road and miss the vehicle for emergency vehicles.
Subsequently, the police of the beating drum squadron also temporarily stopped the vehicles from entering the control section and queued up for the 120 emergency vehicles that were about to arrive.
At 1500 hours, a Sichuan U-plate ambulance drove into the territory of Beichuan. The Beichuan traffic police sent a police car to drive, escorting the emergency vehicle all the way into the control section.
It is understood that only one vehicle can pass through some places on the Huanhu Road. The police carried out temporary control of these places in advance, ensuring the smooth passage of the 120 emergency vehicles.
When they reached the village of Shilibei in Xuanping Township, there was a section of road that could not be mistaken. So the traffic police contacted the village committee ahead of time, borrowed the village road to bypass, and banned the entry of social vehicles.
"It took only 40 minutes for the Beichuan traffic police to receive 120 emergency vehicles and drive into the normal road of 302 provincial roads."
Gala Wei said that, according to the normal situation, the entire passage time will take 4 hours.
"This arrangement has successfully secured valuable treatment time for the patient."
It is reported that at 17:20, critically ill patients were sent to Mianyang in time for treatment.

Indonesia's Vice President Kara said the death toll could rise to thousands.
Earlier, Indonesian President Joko Widodo had surveyed the disaster area and called on the people to be patient.
Nov 4 (Reuters) - The Daily Telegraph reported on Sunday that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab privately demanded Britain's right to leave the "safeguard" arrangement at the Irish border in three months' time.
The report said Raab made the request to Ireland's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade Simon Coveney at a private meeting in London last Tuesday.
The report said the request was a "clear contradiction" with the statement made by David Lidington, the British Cabinet Office minister, during a visit to Dublin three days later.
The Department for Brexit Affairs said it would not comment on private meetings.
At 8:05 a.m. yesterday, two suspected pickpockets were caught stealing from the Yongdingmen station of the No. 20 bus to the Zhushikou station.
Two pickpocket men cut the pocket of the passenger's coat and stole $800 of the cash, leaving the police, who had already been squatting nearby, to grab it.
This is the first case of pickpocketing uncovered by the Beijing police during the National Day.
At more than 5 a.m. yesterday, the anti-scratch investigators of the Beijing Public Security Mobile Investigation Team arrived at the predetermined position.
According to past experience, where the flow of people is concentrated, the public transport hub and the public transport subway line, including the crowds watching the flag-raising in Tian'anmen Square, are the key areas of their work.
In the crowd, the civilian police in civilian clothes calmly observed the passing crowd.
At more than 7 a.m., investigators who were squatting at the bus stop found two suspicious men following a male passenger on the 20th bus from Yongdingmen station.
In the car, two suspicious men, one on the left and one on the right, sandwiched the male passenger in the middle. One of them tried to give cover to the other.
But they didn't know that their every move had already fallen into the eyes of the civilian police who were watching from the sidelines.
"Catching the thief and catching the stolen goods ", the civilian police in civilian clothes pay attention to the fire. In the process of waiting for the man to steal, the police couldn't take their eyes off the man who was ready to pick up the stolen goods. After their pick-pocketing, they were caught by the investigators.
Beijing Morning Post reporter saw that the police seized 800 yuan in cash from the theft suspect.
"They took the money from the passenger's clothes pocket."
"They cut this place open and stole 800 yuan from a visitor to Beijing. When we caught them, the money had just been put into their own pockets," the police said, pointing to a broken coat pocket.
Reporters learned that in order to catch the two men, plainclothes police officers followed for a full hour and finally caught them at the time of the crime.
The two suspects are currently under police scrutiny.
Plainclothes police told reporters that in the crowd who is suspicious, this problem is very simple for the police.
"If they catch more thieves, they will find that their eyes and looks are different from those of ordinary passengers. In addition to staring at people's pockets and backpacks, they also like to drill into the crowd rather than walk away from people."
The police also told reporters that suspects often have no purpose in waiting for a car, like to roam the station and find the object of pickpocketing before tailgating the car.
"It's all a matter of experience. It's natural to know that the clothes have been dry for so long."
In addition, the police also suggested that "the jacket pocket is the most convenient to put things, and the most vulnerable to theft."
During the ride, you should pay attention to your own belongings in order to prevent theft.

British Prime Minister Theresa May called on her party to unite behind her Brexit plan on Sunday, directly calling on critics to support it, saying the free trade deal they want is at the heart of her Brexit plan.
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May heads to the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, Britain, September 30, 2018.
Theresa May's plans have come under fire again from two former Cabinet ministers at the start of the Tory party's emotional annual conference, including former Foreign Secretary Johnson calling Theresa May's plans "unhinged."
But she also received strong support from other pro-Brexit ministers, who "praised Theresa May as one of the most polite people," with International Trade Secretary Fox and Foreign Secretary Hunt also pointing their ire at the EU.
Theresa May's already fragile leadership came under further pressure this month as the EU rejected parts of the so-called "Chequers" plan.
But Theresa May has taken a positive view of these consultations, saying she is prepared to consider the EU's doubts.
"My message to my own party is let's work together to find the best deal for the UK," said Theresa May.
Former British Foreign Secretary Johnson called Theresa May's plans "unhinged" and attacked her for not having confidence in Brexit.
He and former Brexit Secretary Davis are pushing for a Canada-style free trade deal with the European Union.
Theresa May, for her part, said the proposal would allow Northern Ireland to implement different tariff rules, which would be tantamount to Northern Ireland splitting from the UK.

In recent years, there have been incidents of unqualified plastic runways on campus in many places.
To this end, the Ministry of Education issued a notice that the new national standard must be implemented for the surface sports venues of synthetic materials for primary and secondary schools to be delivered for use after November 1 this year.
The compulsory national standard 鈥淪ynthesis Materials Surface Sports Grounds for Primary and Secondary Schools鈥? was led by the Ministry of Education and drafted with the participation of 26 scientific research institutes and testing institutions. After more than two years of revision, more than 100 expert meetings were organized during the period, as well as on-the-spot inspection and sample inspection throughout the country, and numerous verification experiments of products of hundreds of enterprises on the market were collected.
In comparison with the old national standard of 2005, reporters found that the new national standard has not only changed from a "national recommended standard" to a "national mandatory standard ", but also added a number of contents, including thickness requirements, physical properties, anti-aging properties, inorganic filler content requirements, anti-slip adhesive high polymer content requirements, limit of harmful substances in finished products, limit of harmful substances in non-solid and solid raw materials.
In particular, it is worth mentioning that the new national standard has set a limit on the harmful substances that may be produced in the construction of plastic runways on campus, from the original 7 items to 18 items, and has set a limit on the amount of volatile organics in the runways after construction in accordance with the home improvement standards.
For example, the release of hazardous substances is specified in the "Limits and odour requirements of hazardous substances in cast-in-place and prefabricated surface products ". Total volatile organic compounds are required to be no higher than 5 mg/m3, formaldehyde no higher than 0.4 mg/m3, carbon disulfide no higher than 7 mg/m3, benzene no higher than 0.1 mg/m3, and odour grade no higher than 3.
The new national standard has also made detailed provisions on the sampling requirements, inspection rules, judging rules and other issues of plastic runways in primary and secondary schools.
In addition, the campus artificial lawn has also been included in the compulsory testing scope of the national standard for the first time.
In the near future, all localities should carry out special work arrangements on the implementation of the new national standard, and submit the implementation of the new national standard to the Department of Physical Education, Health and Arts Education of the Ministry of Education within the year.
On the afternoon of September 30, Chengdu (Wang Yu), a client of CNN, the 2018 Women's Table Tennis World Cup final arena staged the "National Table Tennis Civil War ".
In the end, Grand Slam winner Ding Ning's team-mate Zhu Yuling, who played at home at 4:0, reached the Women's Table Tennis World Cup title again after four years. This is the 21st time that Chinese women's table tennis has taken off the tournament crown.
Ding Ning and Zhu Yuling are both teammates and friends. Both parties are quite familiar with each other's skills and tactics.
Whether it's preparation or pre-match warm-up, both sides are just like each other.
Entering the final, the two men agreed that they had completed the task of the competition.
But the contest between Ding Ning and Zhu Yuling in the competition is nothing short of a knife and a sword.
In the first inning, Ding Ning, who had the best experience in the tournament, started with a 3:1 lead. Then Zhu Yuling took advantage of Ding Ning's error to make the score 3.
Then Zhu Yuling's mistake in the attack began to increase. Ding Ning took the opportunity to score 3 points 9:5, and took the first set point with 10:6.
Although Zhu Yuling was chasing three points, Ding Ning still used his serve to take the first set at 11:9.
In the second inning, Zhu Yuling's error was still high. Ding Ning took advantage of the advantage in the stalemate to lead by 6:1.
Zhu Yuling scored 2 points with a change of pace after 2:7, and then used the attack to score 8:9 at one time.
At the critical moment, Ding Ning scored 2 minutes 11:8 to win another game.
In the third game, the two started to bite into a tight 3:3 tie.
Ding Ning then made more mistakes in the attack and lost three points, but she then used the sharp attack to score three points to level the score at 6.
Zhu Yuling scored 2 points to establish the advantage again, and got the game point first with 10:8.
But Ding Ning's attack was extremely ferocious. After scoring four points, he took the third set at 12:10.
In the fourth inning, Zhu Yuling got off to a 4: 2 lead.
But since then, Ding Ning has shown a super-strong attacking state, scoring four points before stopping Zhu Yuling.
After the suspension came back, Zhu Yuling recovered some form and gradually chased the score to 8:8.
At the crucial moment, Ding Ning didn't have a soft hand and scored 2 points to get match point.
With Zhu Yuling back out of bounds, Ding Ning swept his opponent 4-0 to win the title.
Last month, Ding Ning won the Bulgarian Open, ending her 14-month championship drought, and came to Chengdu, although she said before the tournament that she did not set a target for this competition, and in the semi-final at the end of the morning, Ding Ning said she had completed the task.
In the end, Ding Ning overcame teammate Zhu Yuling to win her third individual World Cup title. She expressed satisfaction with her performance: "A championship is important for every athlete.
I didn't think of it before the game. I just said that I'm very satisfied to play in the final. "
Chu Yuling, the Sichuan sister of the home team, won a silver medal and did not complete the goal of defending her title. She said, "I think I can handle the pressure in the whole competition. Today, Ding Ning played very well, so she has not found the rhythm."
To activate rural consumption, it is necessary to rely on the normalized mechanism to purify the market, guide healthy consumption demand, and enhance farmers'sense of acquisition on consumption.
The data showed that the consumption potential of rural residents continued to be released. Retail sales of rural consumer goods increased by 10.5% in the first half of this year. The growth rate was 1.3 percentage points higher than that of cities and towns.
During a visit to a poverty-stricken village in a western county, there was only one convenience store in the village. Some goods appeared to be familiar with each other. "Golden Dragon Fish" was marked as "Golden Dragon Oil "," Wang Zi "became" Wang Milk ", and "Shanzhai" had a lot of goods.
Over the years, similar phenomena have frequently been revealed. Some rural fake and low-quality goods are near famous brands, with similar names, similar packaging, and false and false authenticity, which makes it impossible to prevent.
A consumption survey report released by a city in the western part of the country revealed that the problem of over-counterfeit goods in rural businesses is serious. Sixty-six percent of users have bought fake goods in the offline supermarket in the townships, of which food accounts for more than half.
The relevant departments have rectified the rural market, shouting and beating year after year. Why is "Li Ghost" still fighting repeatedly?
Unlike the urban market, farmers' awareness of rights protection is relatively weak. This, coupled with the fact that many rural areas are remote and in blind areas beyond the reach of regulatory forces, has given rise to a breeding ground for fake and low-quality commodities.
A commodity is multi-headed, some departments are in charge of prices, some are in charge of production, some are in charge of the market, their functions are cross-cutting, they fight against fakes year after year, they concentrate on managing a gust of wind, fake goods evade the spotlight, and slowly come out, just after the old vacation, the new vacation comes out.
In the absence of a long-term supervision mechanism, the rural market is difficult to be purified, the illegal cost is low and the benefits are large. As a result, some illegal traders have become obsessed with "going to the mountains and going to the countryside ", and some rural areas have become" waste elimination markets ".
From food and clothing to well-off, the vast number of farmers are moving towards development-oriented consumption.
A few days ago, the Central Committee of the Party and the State Council issued "Some Opinions on Improving the Mechanism of Promoting Consumption System to Further Stimulate the Consumption Potential of Residents," in which it proposed to promote the upgrading of the consumption ladder of rural residents, with the aim of making farmers "able to consume "," willing to consume "and" dare to consume ", so as to make rural consumption really flourish.
On the one hand, it is necessary to deepen the reform, eliminate the malpractices of market supervision and administration, improve the food safety and product quality supervision network according to local conditions, and continuously reduce the space for making and selling fakes in rural areas.
On the other hand, it is necessary to strengthen the enforcement of the law, crack down on the supervision of "capillary vessels ", and never allow fake and shoddy products to breed and spread in rural areas.
Severe punishment of pit farmers is the protection of farmers. No matter how hidden the counterfeiters are, they should not become the reason for the breeding of fake and low-quality commodities. The relevant departments should clearly define their responsibilities, the grass-roots supervision force is sinking, and where there is a problem, they should be held responsible, so that the counterfeiters and sellers have no place to hide.
We should strictly control the entry of the market, strictly examine the qualifications of the producers and business operators, put the market flow through customs, let the products come and go, and find ways from the source and the root, so that the legitimate distributors can operate in peace of mind and the farmers can buy in peace of mind.
To activate rural consumption, we should guide healthy consumption demand.
With the consumption upgrading, many farmers not only seek to eat enough and eat well, but also pursue high-quality life such as culture and health. They cannot equate the rural market with "low-quality" and "low-cost ".
This requires promoting the extension of e-commerce to the vast rural areas, unblocking the two-way linkage sales channels between urban and rural areas, promoting the combination of the offline industry development platform and the online e-commerce trading platform, and supporting the expansion of the new mode of consumption to the rural market; promoting the organic integration of trade logistics with leisure agriculture, rural tourism and product processing in towns and townships where conditions permit; improving the rural modern circulation network system, optimizing the integration of existing facilities and resources, and effectively reducing the cost of rural circulation.
To create a clear and secure market environment for the rural areas, so that farmers do not worry about their consumption, rural consumption can become more and more prosperous, so as to enhance the sense of acquisition and happiness of farmers' consumption.
From November 1, China will reduce the most-favoured-nation tariff rate for some goods, and the total tariff level will be reduced to 7.5%
In accordance with the decision of the 26th executive meeting of the State Council, the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council issued a public notice on the 30th, reducing the most-favoured-nation tax rate of some commodities as of November 1, 2018.
According to the "Notice of the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council on Reducing the Import Tariff of Some Commodities ", in order to meet the needs of industrial upgrading, reducing the cost of enterprises and meeting the multi-level consumption of the masses, from November 1 this year, the MFN tariff rate of some industrial goods and other commodities will be reduced.
A total of 1,585 tariff items were reduced, accounting for about 19% of the total tax items in China. The average tax rate fell from 10.5% to 7.8%, with an average reduction of 26%.
This tax reduction is mainly related to textiles; stone, ceramics, glass products; some steel and base metal products; electromechanical equipment and parts, such as metal processing machinery, textile machinery, engineering machinery, transmission and transformation equipment, electrical equipment, instruments and instruments; resource commodities and primary processing products, such as non-metallic minerals, inorganic chemicals, wood and paper products, precious jade, etc.
At the same time, with the reduction of the total tariff level, especially the import tariffs of drugs and consumer goods for daily use, the tariff rate of the import tax on imported goods will be lowered accordingly.
In order to implement the decision-making and deployment of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, China has implemented zero tariffs on the vast majority of imported drugs since May 1 this year, reduced import tariffs on automobiles, parts and components, and some consumer goods for daily use since July 1, and implemented the third step of reducing taxes on products covered by the information technology agreement.
Reporters learned from the State Council Tariff Commission that since the beginning of this year, after a series of independent adjustments, China ’ s total tariff level will fall from 9.8% in the previous year to 7.5%, with an average reduction of 23%.
The appropriate reduction of tariffs is conducive to the balanced development of foreign trade, the promotion of a higher level of opening to the outside world, the overall utilization of both international and domestic resources, and the promotion of domestic supply-side structural reform.
Relevant officials of the committee said that this year marks the 40th anniversary of reform and opening-up. The initiative to reduce the overall level of tariffs is a practical action to implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the Boao Forum for Asia. It is also an important measure for China to further expand opening-up and actively expand imports in accordance with its own high-quality development needs. This action and initiative shows that China will unswervingly pursue a win-win opening-up strategy and, while enhancing its own development drive, will also make China's development better benefit the world.
On September 29, the launch of the regional public brand of agricultural products of "Huanxiang People" in Huan County, Gansu Province was held in Nankai District, Tianjin City.
Red Army millet, black beans, mountain children's shepherd's song black goat, hardcover tartary buckwheat tea, paper-cut leather album, pure hand-made slippers... one piece of exquisitely packaged agricultural products are neatly placed on the exhibition stand. They have a common brand name called "ring country people ".
"The creation of a regional brand of" ring rural people "has effectively solved the development bottleneck of" many and scattered, small and weak "agricultural products in the ring county, and has become a powerful carrier for poverty eradication." On the 29th, the launch of the regional public brand of "ring rural people" agricultural products hosted by Gansu ring county was held in Nankai District, Tianjin City.
Located at the junction of the three provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu and Ningxia, Huan County has a long history and rich resources as the "advanced grain production county of the whole country ", the" township of China's small grains "and the" township of China's shadow ".
Lamb meat, yellow rice wine, buckwheat noodles, soft Yan noodles and other local snacks are the flavor that travelers in other places often recall.
With the continuous improvement of the level of urbanization in China and the rapid growth of the urban population, a large number of rural young people have left their hometowns to start urban life.
Yang Qiaojia, an expert in Chinese agricultural brand research, said: "Now that the pace of urban life is fast and the pressure is high, more and more people are beginning to miss the rural life when they were children. However,'the most beautiful memory is the countryside', and the design of the'Ringxiang People' brand is named after the homesickness and homesickness of people who wandered around the county."
The surrounding county has special climatic conditions, long sunshine time, large temperature difference between day and night, and unique conditions for the cultivation of small grains.
The territory is rich in more than 20 types of small grains. It is the home of China's small grains. Its output is the highest in Gansu Province, and its quality is among the highest in the country.
Wang Xiaoli, a girl from Huanxian County who went to school in Tianjin, participated in the promotion as a volunteer. She said, "The people in her hometown are the closest, and the taste of her hometown is the most beautiful. The'Ringxiang People' brand reminds us of too much homesickness and memories. What we cannot forget is the food of the time there. We hope that the'Ringxiang People' brand will go further and become bigger."
Dr. Tan Bin, a researcher at the Scientific Research Institute of the State Food and Material Reserve Bureau, said that through the testing of more than 900 sets of index data, the testing data of buckwheat, tartary buckwheat, black beans and other agricultural products in Huanxian County are prominent. The content of many physiological active substances in miscellaneous grains is higher than the standard data. "People living in the surrounding countryside" have the inherent advantage of occupying the domestic high-end grain market.
Chai Chun, secretary of the Huanxian County Party Committee, said that through the release of the "Huanxiang People" brand, it will further enhance the level of quality, standardization and large-scale innovation and development of high-quality agricultural products in Huanxian County. It will help to create a good overall image of agricultural products in Huanxian County, and quickly enhance the visibility, competitiveness and added value.
Canada ’ s gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 0.2% in July from the previous month, a higher-than-expected rise, fueling expectations that the Bank of Canada will raise interest rates next month.
If it does, it will be the fifth time in a little more than a year that the central bank has raised interest rates.
Analysts interviewed by Reuters had expected growth of 0.1%.
Statistics Canada said on Friday that 12 of the 20 industries achieved growth.
The data is notable because the central bank predicted earlier this month that temporary factors could drag down the third-quarter GDP data.
On Thursday, Bank of Canada President Poloz pledged that the central bank will continue to gradually raise interest rates and will closely monitor economic data.
The Bank of Canada's next interest rate decision will be announced on October 24.
The Bank of Canada has raised interest rates four times since July 2017 as the Canadian economy has strengthened and the unemployment rate is near record low.
Stephen Brown, a senior Canadian economist at Kaitou Macro, said the country's economy is expected to grow at an annual rate of about 2% in the third quarter.
"This will be higher than the 1.5% expected by the Bank of Canada, so it will be another reason to expect the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates next month," he said in a report.
The overnight index swap showed that the market's estimate of the probability of the Bank of Canada raising interest rates in October rose from 76.46% to 78.27%.
For the first time in 65 years, the two Koreas jointly visited the entrance of the Han River into the sea
South Korea's Defense Ministry confirmed on Friday that the two Koreas launched a joint inspection of the waters of the Han River and the Linjin River into the Haikou on the same day.
The initiative is a preliminary preparation for safeguarding the freedom of navigation of civilian vessels of both sides.
According to a briefing provided to the media by the South Korean Ministry of Defense on the same day, this is the first time that the two sides have conducted a joint inspection of the entrance of the Han River to the sea since the Korean War armistice agreement was signed in 1953.
The two Koreas signed a military agreement in September this year, and agreed to jointly inspect the waters such as the entrance to the Haikou of the Han River from November, so as to ensure the environmental protection and development of tourism in the waters in the future.
In October, the ROK and the DPRK made plans for the joint inspection of the waters during the general military-level meeting.
On November 5, the joint inspection of Korean and Korean waters was officially launched.
The joint mission was composed of 20 members, including the military and experts of the ROK and the DPRK.
According to the South Korean Ministry of Defense, during the visit, the personnel of both sides did not carry weapons and banned the use of words and deeds to stimulate the other side.
"Because there is no military demarcation line near the entrance to the sea, the area was once an accident-prone area, but through joint inspection, it will become a new peaceful area in the future."
The waters jointly visited by the two Koreas are about 70 km in length, with a total area of about 280 square kilometers.
The Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Korea said that the ROK will send six research vessels to explore the depth of the sea water and provide basic information for the safe navigation of the waters. After the investigation is completed, navigation maps will be provided for civilian vessels to and from.
The two Koreas held summit talks in Pyongyang in October 2007 and reached an agreement on the joint use of the Han River and the Linjin River to enter the sea. However, the follow-up talks were stalled because of the tense situation on the peninsula.
According to the military agreement signed by the two Koreas in September, in the future, vessels of both sides need to inform each other in advance before sailing in the common waters.
On November 5, according to the website of the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia, on November 4, Chinese citizens Guo Yuqin and Mao Runxin lost their association during their tour in Mongolia.
It is understood that the two are members of the Blue Sky Rescue Team. On October 19, the two men contacted their relatives and friends in the country and said that they would soon explore the mountains near Lake Kusugur, and shared their location through WeChat. After that, they lost contact and are suspected to have gone to the no-man's land.
The Chinese Embassy in Mongolia has always attached great importance to the protection of the legitimate rights and interests and security of Chinese citizens in Mongolia, as well as to consular protection and assistance.
Upon learning of the news of the loss of the above-mentioned two tourists, the embassy immediately launched the emergency plan for receiving insurance, and strived to seize the golden rescue time and fully carry out its work.
The embassy maintained close communication with the family of the person concerned, assisted the family to immediately report the case to the Mongolian police, and provided the family with a list of interpreters for their choice.
At the first time, the embassy met with the heads of the Ministry of Foreign Relations, the General Bureau of Police and the General Bureau of Emergency Situations of Mongolia, briefed them on the relevant situation, requested the Mongolian side to carry out the search and rescue as soon as possible, and maintained close communication with the Mongolian side throughout the search and rescue process to ensure timely and up-to-date progress.
At the same time, the embassy assisted the families in finding people in Mongolia, and extensively launched overseas Chinese and Chinese-funded enterprises in Mongolia to actively participate in the search for people, provide effective clues, and provide relevant assistance to a number of blue sky rescue team members who went to Mongolia to assist in the rescue.
With the strong impetus of the embassy, the Mongolian side dispatched a rescue team at the first time and promised to waive the search and rescue cost.
The General Directorate of the Mongolian Police and the General Directorate of Emergency Situations instructed the police and the emergency department of the province of Kusugur to search and rescue.
As Kusugur Lake is located in the northern part of Mongolia at the border with Russia, it is remote, sparsely populated, and extremely inconvenient for transportation and communication. At present, Mongolia has entered a severe winter, with temperatures as low as minus 20 degrees. Local police and emergency departments have overcome enormous difficulties, mobilized almost all police forces, and mobilized local herders to carry out carpet search and rescue in a wide range of areas around the two people's lost position through horse riding, walking, and visiting herdsmen.
At the same time, in view of the special situation of the pastoral area, the Mongolian side has been issuing a search notice through the broadcast cycle for many days.
Relevant staff of the domestic blue sky rescue team have also come to Mongolia to actively participate in the rescue with the Mongolian side.
The safety and security of the two missing persons has always touched our hearts.
So far, the two have been out of touch for more than 10 days. The embassy has received a number of clues, but they have not yet been found. At present, the search and rescue operation is still under way.
The embassy will always follow the principle of "putting people first ", continue to pay attention to this matter, promote Mongolia to continue to make full efforts in search and rescue, and provide maximum assistance to the families of the parties concerned.
The embassy appealed to the compatriots and enterprises in Mongolia to contact the Chinese embassy in Mongolia at the first time if they learned of the relevant clues.
