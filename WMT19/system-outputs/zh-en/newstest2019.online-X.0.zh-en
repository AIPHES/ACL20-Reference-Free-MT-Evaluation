The U.S. Navy is dynamically deploying troops into a "new battle mode" as part of the U.S.'s comeback action against Russia, China and other contenders, and it will help to make the opponent right where the U.S. aircraft carrier combat group or other assets will be deployed at any given time and location to be caught by surprise.
He said: "we navy and Marine Corps support it - - the concept of combat unpredictable, do not appear again and again in the same place, almost like the clockwork - - that is our practice."
Reports say that the first attempt to try this new approach was the aircraft carrier combat group of the " Harry Solomon which was the early deployment of the combat group, which included a job visit to the port and patrol in the usually-passed area.
Mo said the U.S. Navy is currently working to ensure that the allies know that the ships will still be patrolling traditional areas and are also addressing logistical and family liaison issues for the new deployment process.
Australian Royal Navy Commander Michael nu will also speak in this event, saying the Australian Army can work with the U.S. aircraft carrier combat group.
He said that as the Australian Royal Navy plans to buy another 9 Frigates with the "Zeus shield" Combat System, this will continue.

The most advanced 19 wave feed receiver in the world is now co-developed by Chinese and Australian scientists.
Marshall said the successful development of the receiver is based on the technology accumulation of csiro for years, and the fast survey speed will increase by 5 TO 6 times as soon as it is enabled, and more scientific observation targets will also be expanded.
"it's a force that csiro has contributed to fast."

"under the current environment, technological innovation is hard to accomplish alone, and it needs extremely high cost, and there are so many issues to be solved, so cooperation is especially important today."
Marshall said that the closer the cooperation is, the more likely it is to achieve breakthrough progress, and it is also the meaning of enhanced cooperation between the two sides in the framework of " all the way around the world
"strengthening bilateral cooperation is mainly technology cooperation for us"
Marshall, for example, has recently developed a gold-purification method that does not use cyanide, as traditional cyanide gold purification laws are very harmful to the environment, and many countries are hoping to find a kind of environmental pollution. Small Gold Purification Method.

North Korea's Foreign Minister Lee Yong-ho said Saturday to the united nations that the continued imposition of sanctions is deepening North Korea's mistrust of the United States, and North Korea could not unilaterally abandon nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Lee Yong-ho said at the un general assembly that North Korea has taken a "very friendly approach" over the past year, including the cessation of missiles and nuclear tests, the dismantling of nuclear testing sites, and the commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"but we didn't see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"there is no confidence in the security of our country that we do not trust in the United States, and in this case we will not be able to give up weapons unilaterally."
While Lee yong ho is repeating the North Korea's complaint against the United States against the "phased phase" of going to nuclear, his speech is of great significance, because there is no one-sided refusal to nuclear unilaterally, as North Korea has used to do.
Lee Yong-ho mentioned Kim Jong-Eun and trump's joint statement on June 12 when Kim Jong-eun agreed to work towards the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" and trump promised to protect North Korea's security.
North Korea has been seeking to officially end the 1950-53 North Korean war, but the U.S. says North Korea must give up on nuclear weapons first.
The United States has also refused to relax its demands on North Korea's international sanctions.
" The United States insists on going to nuclear first, and increases the pressure on sanctions to achieve a high-pressure approach, and even refuse to publish the 'WAR END DECLARATION', says lee yong ho.
" the idea that sanctions can make us beg for forgiveness is that people who don't know us are daydreaming.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions are deepening our mistrust. "
Lee yong ho did not mention the second golden union plan that the president of the United States had mentioned earlier this week in the United Nations.
Instead, he emphasized Kim Jong-Eun and South Korean President's three meetings in the past five months, and said: "if the other side of the nuclear nuclear is south korea instead of North Korea, then the Korean Peninsula goes to nuclear it's not going to be so standoff."

The Global number of goods trade in China is the first of the world, and there is already a further expansion of the open economic base, but the quality and effectiveness of trade development are gaps compared to the developed economies, and therefore, the overall tariff level should be reduced properly.
Tariffs are a protective tool for compliance, and tariff levels should be adapted to industrial competitiveness, encouraging benign competition, excessive protection against industrial development and improving quality.
Tariff Tax adjustment needs to take into account production needs and consumption needs.
The focus is on lower domestic demand, which helps to upgrade the commodity tax rate of industrial transition, efforts to increase the concentration of the people's demand for more concentrated products, and continue to enhance business and public sense, and meet the upgrading needs of industrial structure and consumption.
Lowering taxes should take into account the affordability of financial revenue and industrial development.

It is conducive to the integrated use of two resources outside the international country, and to promote the quality of domestic supply system. Improve, meet the people's people's consumption upgrade needs.
This action and initiative shows that China will unswervingly pursue a mutually beneficial and win-win strategy, firmly support economic globalization, resolutely uphold the principles of free trade and the multilateral trading system at the core of the wto, and continue to draw on the development momentum from the open to the world, and also let china development is better to benefit the world.
Serbia's announcement to enter the highest operational status of the president of Ethiopia will meet tomorrow to discuss the situation in kosovo
Nantong quoted a message from the office of the president of Serbia that, in view of the occupation by kosovo special forces of the passage of the water hydropower station, which is controlled by the bei side in Northern Kosovo, Serbia President Vũ ordered the armed forces of the country to enter the highest operational status.
Serbia's defense minister kung fu claimed that the serbian army had entered a full-fledged state of readiness on September 29th.
The kung fu stressed that as long as the order issued by vũ remains valid, Serbia will continue to maintain its monitoring of the situation in Kosovo, no matter which direction it is going to develop, the serbian army will respond.
According to the Russian news agency, on September 29, in an interview, vũ said that he has been informed of the current situation by the parties and other parties in Russia and Europe, and will travel to Moscow and Russia on October 2 Ross President Putin meets to seek Putin's support on the kosovo issue.
When asked whether serbia needed to gain Russian military support like Syria, vũ gave a negative answer: "I don't want a major military conflict on our territory"
Vũ also said that the force's entry into full readiness is just to form a deterrent to stop the conflict, but it is also a clear warning that it will definitely not tolerate any act of violence in kosovo.
The Force's readiness to improve its readiness is related to two major movements in kosovo.
In the wake of the serbian side, the Albanian people in the northern part of kosovo have recently arrested the serbian people living in the land, and those arrested serbs have not violated any law.
Vũ said the Albanian population has been escalating in the region since the beatings and seizure of the serbian army in kosovo and metohija by the head of the serbian government in kosovo and metohija, on March 26, 26, there is no humane arrest and deportation of the serbs.
In addition, more than 100 people, including rosu special forces, armed police and snipers, have been declared to be established by the department of internal affairs of the republic of Kosovo, to take over the positions near the lake reservoir in the add hydropower station, entering the ecology near the northern dam of the kosovo region. And The Sports Center, and blocked all the roads nearby, which have been controlled by the serbian side.
Vũ pointed out that this military adventure in kosovo was made with the encouragement of western countries, and the actions of the kosovo army have not been notified of the serbian side in advance, in violation of the "Cloth" the agreement, chapter ix, paragraph 1244, also violates un security council resolution 1244 and the military technical agreement between the section.
Vũ has spoken to NATO Secretary-General Stoltenberg to criticize western countries for their hypocritical rhetoric on kosovo.
The Root of this conflict is still the centuries-old historical feud between the two ethnic groups in kosovo.
With regard to Kosovo's belonging, serbs and albanians have all the claims.
Serbia sees kosovo as the birthplace and culture cradle of the nation, as serbia has built its strongest country here in the 12th century, while the albanians are just invading and of in the ottoman empire a massive move has been made after losing the north.
The Albanians insist that the original tribe of the, living in kosovo in the 4-5th century B.C., is the ancestor of the Albanian people, and that kosovo has been the territory of the Albanian tribe since ancient times.
The subjective political divide caused intense clashes between ethnic, religious and cultural cultures, causing fierce opposition between the serbs and albanians in the kosovo region.
In 1912, the kosovo albanians first announced the independence of Albania.
Since the first world war, a large number of albanians living in the balkans have moved to turkey, and the proportion of serbs is relatively rising, and the serbs appear to be " just taking back their own land but they are considered by the albanians. The plundering of the " big " is fuelled by the contradictions between the two communities.
Kosovo has become a "Powder Powder" for the balkans.
In 1999, an armed conflict between the albanian separatist in the Kosovo Liberation Army and the serbian army and police led to the bombing of the NATO Army's South Union, composed of Serbia and montenegro, the outbreak of the kosovo war.
On February 17, 2008, kosovo unilaterally declared independence from Serbia.
Since then, there has been news that Serbia will normalize relations with kosovo and sign global and legally binding agreements, but due to historical National Feud and geopolitical constraints, it is subject to the agreement of the forces of the United States and Europe. Not able to sign.
And just a month ago, vũ made the first clear statement that the serbs and albanians in kosovo would be segregated, and once again, the two ethnic groups would be openly open.

The decline in South Korea's exports in September has been the biggest in over two years, but analysts blame the decline for less working days, saying the global demand for south korean commodities remains strong despite the rising tensions in China and America.

The Core of the agreement is to try to create a new payment mechanism that replaces dollar deals with barter or currency pricing.
The method is aimed at bypassing the United States and preventing the U.S. from hindering financial transfers.
Meanwhile, while the EU is committed to the agreement, some french and British officials are also concerned that if the agreement is to be achieved, it will be the most open confrontation between the EU and the United States against the U.S. exit from the nuclear deal..

" this ensures that we sell oil and benefits Zach believes that states have legitimate rights to trade with Iran, according to the agreement reached in 2015

Iranian Oil Minister, like Gary, has revealed that no other country has stopped buying Iranian oil except South Korea.

Road Nagoya on November 5-Japan's Central Bank Chief Black Black said on Monday that the central bank is aware that the long-term implementation of Ultra-loose monetary policies could squeeze the financial institutions margins and potentially disrupt the stability of the banking system in the country.
But he said the Japanese Central Bank needs to maintain its massive stimulus plan, in light of the inflation downturn and uncertainty over the overseas economy, while closely following the pros and cons of its policies.
"the central bank of Japan has fully acknowledged that the power of financial institutions will be increasingly affected under sustained monetary easing," Black East said in his address to business leaders in nagoya.
He said the banking system could be in turmoil if the financial institutions were more active in taking risks to compensate for the impact of low interest rates over the years on low interest rates, and once severe negative shocks were caused.
"despite the fact that these risks are not big at the moment, the central bank will pay close attention to the development of the situation and encourage financial institutions to take the necessary measures," he said.
The record of the Japan Central Bank Conference, which was announced earlier on Monday, shows that at the September meeting, the Japanese Central Bank Policy Committee discussed the rising cost of long-term easing policies.
The record of the meeting shows that a member said that if the economy continues to expand, "The Japanese Central Bank will have more resilient space in the future of policy"

"there is a need to continue strong monetary easing policies while considering positive and negative effects in a balanced way," Black said.
Despite the increase in the malaise of radical stimulus schemes, such as long-term low interest rates that erode the profit of financial institutions, inflation is forcing the central bank of Japan to maintain the plan.
The Central Bank of Japan maintained monetary policy last month; in the face of the risks posed by the global trade war dispute, black exclude ruled out the possibility of recent rising interest rates.

Recently, some private enterprises have encountered a lot of difficulties and problems in their business development.
For example, the changes in the international economic environment are affecting some export enterprises; the rapid adjustment of demand structures brings about the pressure to upgrade the pressure; some policies are not coordinated, policy effects are superimposed, or simple working methods, leading to a number of original intentions that are good for policy generation the opposite role and so on.
Various factors are intertwined, the private economy is experiencing difficulties. Some private enterprises are facing difficulties, and entrepreneurs have shown a lot of anxiety.
In this context, correcting the misconceptions of understanding, unloading the burden of the entrepreneur's mind, giving the enterprise the heart-to-mind development, the government's commitment to development, the market confidence and development expectations, is particularly profound.
The Symposium again highlighted the important assertion that " three did not change!" " the status and role of non-public economy in the economic and social development of our country has not changed!"
From deep propulsion to decentralization, the establishment of a power list system to create the rule of law environment that protects the legitimate rights of entrepreneurs, create a market environment for fair competition and shape the atmosphere of respect for entrepreneurs in the whole community. In recent years, the central party's emphasis on entrepreneurs has been unprecedented, and the system's safeguards are unprecedented.
The Symposium is more explicit about policy initiatives that strongly support the development of private enterprises in 6 areas, with a series of practical actions dedicated to the "Light forward" of private enterprises.
These are a great inspiration to the entrepreneur community and more expectations for the community.
The fog is set, the approach is set, the key is to implement.
To create a better development environment for the private economy, help private enterprises solve the difficulties in development, help to achieve the economic transformation of China; let entrepreneurs feel fair in the market competition, feel safe in the legal business, feel respect in social life, inspire innovation vitality and creation potential.
China's economy enters into a process of high quality development, requires more entrepreneurs to perform their ambitions, and also provide greater space and stage for entrepreneurs to play creativity.
We have reason to believe that, with further deepening reforms and breaking barriers, private economy will usher in better development prospects and development opportunities, and move towards a broader stage.

Since the beginning of this year, North Korea has broken the path of the ice and opened the dialogue, and it has held a meeting between North Korea and the U.S. leaders, and the big trend in the situation of the peninsula is continuing to continue, and the principles of dialogue to resolve the peninsula have been maintained.
First of all, " the essence of the peninsula issue is a security problem it has not changed, realizing the peace of the peninsula, the key is proper, balancing the legitimate security concerns of all parties, rather than putting pressure on each other, and stressing the demands of their own.

"in the wake of the global trade battle, the confidence of manufacturers has stagnated due to the weakening of exports and the weakening of factory production," said nan vũ, chief researcher of the agroforestry institute of agriculture and forestry.
"confidence is still high. and as corporate profits are improving and prices are rising, I don't think confidence will continue to slide."
A short-view survey shows that the large manufacturing boom in September has dropped from 21 in 21 to 19 in the 19rd straight season.
The Market's estimated value is 22.
The Large Non-manufacturing boom in September has dropped from 24 in June to 22 in 22, for the first time in eight quarters.
The road survey is at 22.

The Central Bank's short-view survey shows that big businesses are planning to raise 13.4 % of capital spending in the fiscal year ended in March 2019
The previous short-View Survey was 13.6 %.
Nam Wu-Chi said that all corporate capital spending plans grew by 8.5 % in this fiscal year, close to the pace of the Japanese bubble economy.
He said, "in view of the estimated profitability of small businesses from now on, capital spending still has room for further growth, but this depends largely on the impact of trade war on corporate confidence"
The Short-view survey shows the ability of enterprises to transfer costs, and the large enterprise output price index is 7, which is a high point for a decade, and it is encouraging signs that Japan's efforts to combat deflation have made progress.
The Index of measuring the employment status of large businesses has hit negative 23, the most demand level since 1992, highlighting the tightening of the employment market.
Benefiting from the strong corporate spending, the Japanese economy bounced back from the contraction of this year's January 1th.

80.6 % of businesses are expected to export in the year 2018, or at the same level, as the canton fair shows that China's external trade situation remains complex and grim, according to a press release released on Sunday by the china foreign trade center on November 5, 80.6
However, considering that the cost of composite elements such as domestic raw materials and labor force continues to rise, China-us trade friction has a greater impact on the external environment, and exhibitors also believe that next year's export situation should not be optimistic.
At the closing press conference of the 124th Canton fair, the Deputy Secretary-General of the canton fair, the press spokesman, and the deputy director of China Foreign Trade Center, XU Soldier, said that the number and export transactions of the foreign buyers of the canton fair had been reduced to the same time.
The current buyers will be 189,812, from 215 countries and regions, with a 1.11 percent drop in the year.
Export Deals of $ 2,06494 billion ($ 29860 billion), down 1 % from year to year.

XU Soldiers said that as a barometer and vane of China's foreign trade, the current canton fair vendor's posture and export transaction data showed that China's foreign trade development still faces many uncertainty and uncertainty next year.
However, with the deepening of supply side structural reform and the recent policy measures in the country and local areas, the new kinetic energy of China's foreign trade development is accelerating, and the diversification of the enterprise market is constantly making new progress, these are the important foundation and strong conditions of foreign trade development.
"comprehensive factors are expected to maintain a steady growth, quality and effectiveness of China's foreign trade and exports throughout the year." the xu soldier said.
The Chinese customs department announced that in the U.S. Dollar, the September exports were 14.5 % growth on the same year, and imports grew by 14.3 % over the same year, with a trade surplus of $ 31690 billion in September, and the growth and trade surplus in September was the highest since February this year.
Despite the ongoing escalation of China-us trade friction, China's export performance in September is still highly anticipated, with strong external demand, businesses are taking the export of the renminbi to stack up the rmb exchange rate, or the main support factor, in the us before the tariff is imposed, and it also shows a degree of toughness in China's foreign trade. But the impact of China-us trade war on confidence, the impact of the industrial chain cannot be underestimated, analysts believe the challenges of China's foreign trade may be visible in four or next year.
The road survey revealed that the U.S. fund manager proposed in September to increase hold of cash and continue to maintain a cautious stance as the U.S. and China began the latest round of Import Tariffs, and the dispute did not appear to be signs of détente.
However, the 12 fund managers involved in the survey suggested that the North American asset configuration has risen to the highest since June 2017, while the UK, the eurozone, especially emerging market positions, have declined.
The Global stock allocation accounted for 56.6 % of the average, with bonds accounting for 35.5 % and basically consistent with last month's survey.
Its most obvious change is that the cash ratio rose to 5.1 percent, the highest since December 2014
"some economic data brings confidence to the market, but trade wars are still the biggest worry, so it's better to be ready to get in when the market drops"
But fund managers still prefer stocks in September, especially U.S. stocks, even if U.S. stocks are considered to be at a high price.

Looking back at the 40 year of reform and opening, the China who dares to move into the world's market ocean, despite the vortex and wind waves, has always faced all risk challenges in an open posture, constantly releasing the power of the interior and constantly improving the competitiveness.
It can be said that China has a strong interpretation of open value and meaning with its own real-life achievements.
Standing at the new historic starting point, the expo-Importing Expo is a major decision by the central communist party of xi jinping to push forward a new round of high-level opening, and it is China's initiative to open the market to the world. The Major initiative of China's support for economic globalization and trade liberalization has shown the strong and clear will of " the open doors of China will not be closed, and the bigger it will be
And with the registration of exhibitors in various countries, the booth "one hard to seek" is the biggest affirmation and best response to China's greater scope, wider field, and deeper development of open economy.
More importantly, the current global economic and trade order has come to a crossroads.
Some countries have built up a high wall of protectionist protectionism, returning to the path of unilateralism, adding the international community's concerns about the prospects for free trade, and adding a lot of uncertainty to the warming world economy.
In such an era of times, this event of the huangpu river, which embodies China's defense of free trade, makes the world see open markets, share the future of China's confidence and China's role.
Walk alone and go far.
China's open mind, embrace the world, not only has a strong boost to its own development, but also brings the world's countries and regions to a great " China opportunity
In recent years, we have advocated and promoted the construction of " all the way along the road... launching the founding of the Asian-casting line, setting up silk road gold...... China offers a series of international public products that provide real-time export markets, development opportunities and jobs. Let National Enterprises Take China to develop " Express " " lift ".
Into is also such a public product, a big platform for global economic and trade cooperation.
Over the platform, more than 3000 businesses in more than 130 countries and regions have made a new step in the Chinese market with their distinctive quality products and services.
In addition to National Enterprises, there are also domestic consumers who really benefit.
By Setting up this "Optimal Uber" Platform, we provide a multi-channel quality supply for the consumption upgrade, which caters to the people's personalized, diverse and differentiated consumption needs.
As China's open doors are getting bigger, the stock is flowing, and it will make the best of it, and the pace of good life will be more solid.
From a more macro perspective, the meaning of the expo has gone beyond the scope of economy and trade, but it is to focus on the future, to convey the concept of openness, inclusion, inclusiveness, balance, win-win, and to form a common understanding of the challenges of the day.
The world is good, China can be good; China is good, and the world is better.
We expect that the expo will bring the world to a wonderful and successful; we are more hopeful that we will move towards a more high-level "Open China" and the world to work together to build the shining future of the human destiny community.

According to the latest data from the hkma, the exchange fund recorded an investment income of Hk$ 1600 billion in September 2018, which was significantly lower than the Hk$ 61800 billion last year, but it is well in the second quarter of this year. The Revised Hk$ 100 billion.
The Hong Kong and emerging markets stock index runs counter to the us stock index at the beginning of the sino-American Trade War, and the market sentiment is in the end of September until the end of September, when the U.S. stock market index saw the top of the market, the chief executive of the hkma, Mr Chan Tak-Lin said in the legislative council start to reverse, as investors gradually realize that trade war is also detrimental to the U.S. itself.
"the change in market sentiment is a good thing, and if the trade war is only a unilateral impact, it is not helpful to solve things."

Hong Kong has implemented a linked exchange rate system linked to the dollar since 1983
For the current financial situation in Hong Kong, Chen de said that the uncertainty in the economic and asset market has increased, and the downward risk has increased, but the Hong Kong financial system is sound and defensive, and the seismic capability is abundant.
"Hong Kong's international investment position is abundant, with net assets worth $ 14 TRILLION EQUIVALENT TO 4 times GDP, 2.5 times higher than Singapore and 0.6 times Japan, to cope with the economic downturn. The cycle or reversal is enough."
The Hong Kong Dollar's exchange rate has risen over 400 points on September 21, and the market generally believes that it is mainly related to the rise in Hong Kong dollar interest rates, after the recent Hong Kong dollar interest rate has continued to fall and the dollar has been expanded with the us dollar. The Hong Kong dollar is hovering around the us dollar near 7.80-7.84, and the recent decline in the Hong Kong dollar interest rate and the widening of the U.S. dollar may attract market prices and increase the interest rate of the dollar, so that the Hong Kong dollar will be triggered again. The chances of convertibility are bigger than the previous period.
However, he believes that as the Hong Kong bank interest rate cycle begins, the Hong Kong dollar interest rate will be normalized and the future Hong Kong dollar interest rate below the dollar interest rate will change.
"Hong Kong dollar interest rate and us dollar interest rate trend will be more consistent, and we must be more careful about managing risks and getting ready to cope with market volatility."
As Hong Kong dollar funds are abundant, the Hong Kong Dollar's interest rate has fallen further, and the 0.9-month interest rate fell by 0.9 % to 2.08179 % on Monday, with the us dollar rate from 46 points to 51 base points. One Month's interest rate was set at a 127-month low, with the us dollar being expanded from 120 points to 127 base points.
From May to mid-September, the Hong Kong dollar stock exchange rate is close to 7.85 to $ 1 for most of the time.
During the period, due to factors such as interest rate activities and the end of the big prospectuses, the money flows from the Hong Kong dollar, which led to the weak-side convertibility, which was triggered after the first time in April, was triggered again in may and August.
The Hkma is buying the Hong Kong dollar at 7.85 levels in accordance with the linked exchange rate system, and it is selling the dollar to maintain the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.
The hkma bought about Hk$ 52100 billion under the weak-side exchange guarantee mechanism in may and August.

Systemic Lupus erythematosus is a chronic problem that involves multiple organs of the body, which has been considered an "incurable disease" in the past.
Because its pathogenesis is unknown, medical treatment is difficult, and there is no effective treatment to cure it.

Cells.
In Short, the two teams have confirmed that an abnormal immune molecule in the body is an important cause of systemic lupus erythematosus.

Attorney Carrying an axe to court court?
The news was really exciting at first, and it also blew up the pot in the legal circle.
The Chinese law of fujian quanzhou is then fined $ 500 for a lawyer, and in writing, the Quanzhou City Bar Association is advised to conduct an investigation.
According to a report from the new Beijing newspaper, the Quanzhou City Association issued an official announcement that the conduct of the two lawyers does not involve violations of the law and will not be punished by law.
From Multiple reports, the Quanzhou City Association's treatment is not the or confrontational, but it is recognized by the quanzhou central school.
An incident that could have sparked tensions within the legal community is finally properly resolved.
The reversal of things comes from a more complete truth reduction: the axe of a lawyer carrying an axe with the defendant's murder weapon, the same model, but not the blade, only supporting evidence at the evidentiary examination session, without intimidating moves or "endangering the court" the subjective intent of security
Judging whether the conduct of a lawyer is illegal, there are four very important details that need to be concerned: one, the local court has held two sessions before, and only the axe photos were presented. from the defense point of view, it is necessary to show the original axe. 1 the axe was purchased only 1 hours before the court, not the lawyer was unwilling to seek the consent of the judge, but objectively failed to contact the judge; three, the entire axe was not used to be used in the extreme or improper use; its four, involved the lawyer publicly admitted his mistake and apologized to the court.
To consolidate these plots, it can be seen that the lawyer "with the axe" has nothing to do with it, just to defend.
After the fact that the fact was passed, the quanzhou city association did not make a difference, but it was the decision to put the pressure on the top of the pressure.
And this decision also stands in the test of facts and laws.
As far as the court is not allowed, it is easy to cause unease and misunderstanding as an axe to control the knife to bring to the court.
For Safety and caution, the previous fine penalties and judicial advice in quanzhou's middle school are also unreasonable.
In order to safeguard the dignity of lawyers and prevent individual courts from seeking to counsel lawyers, the supreme law issued the rules of the court's judicial police safety inspection in 2014, establishing the principle that lawyers do not need physical security checks in court.
Since the release of the rules, the majority of lawyers led by example, rarely occurred due to security loopholes that could jeopardize the security of the court.
In exceptional cases like quanzhou, the misunderstanding is not difficult to eliminate just in the spirit of mutual respect, understanding and understanding.
The Bar Association, as a self-discipline organization of the lawyers industry, has a dual mission of disciplinary punishment and lawful protection.
In the past, individual associations have been criticized for their emphasis on corrections and their loss.
And the decision of the quanzhou law association, whether from the process or the result, is worthy of praise, setting an example for more of the law association's proper performance.

Since the mid-2000 s, as China has grown in demand for oil seed, the U.S. North Darfur Farmer Paul Thomas has grown more and more soybeans in his land.
The transformation peaked this year, with 1,600 acres of soybean in 5,000 acres, reaching unprecedented scale.
But Thomas and a lot of farmers like him are planning to turn into the previous staple crops of the U.S. Agricultural Zone in 2019: Corn and wheat.
American farmers have surpassed corn this year for the first time since 35
The planned diversion of other food crops is due to the plight of U.S. farmers selling soybeans in the context of U.S. President Trump's trade war against China.
China usually buys about 60 % of U.S. exports of soybeans, but as a result of trade war, almost zero purchases of American soybeans in recent months have led to a drop in soybean prices to a decade low.
Thomas is planning to grow more wheat next year, hoping to earn more by lowering dependence on crops that depend on China's demand.
The Soybean Price "gives us a hard blow" says Thomas.
He said that there is no china buy, and the soybean stock near its farm is $ 7.10 per bushel, and the price required for covering the cost is $ 8.50
U.S. farmers have set a record high for soybean cultivation this year, and the harvest is expected to set a record high.
Just in such an easy time to get hit, they ran into a trade battle.
In response to trump's Tariff Levy on imports of Chinese commodities, China imposed import tariffs on imports of U.S. soybeans in July.
The USDA will release its first estimated report on the planting area next year, which will include consideration of the impact of tariff.
It is expected that the estimate will confirm expectations that civil institutions will reduce the size of soybean seeding.
According to a report seen by the road, informa economics is expected on October 19 that corn cultivation will increase by 4 % to 9,2700 million acres (3,7500 million hectares) in 2019, with soybean planting area will be reduced by 7 % to 8,3000 million acres.
Informa also expects the U.S. Wheat planting area to increase by 4 percent.
The Soybean area planted before the imposition of retaliatory tariffs rose to 8,9600 million acres this year, with an estimated 1,5000 million acres more than 10 years ago.
The area of corn cultivation has increased by less than 5000 million acres since 2008 to 8,9100 million acres, with wheat planting an area of 4,7800 million acres this year, close to the lowest level in 100 years.
The total planting area of the, the president of the ibero-American Corn Planting Association, is 3,600 acres, and this year he's nearly half used to grow soybean, but plans to cut the future.
He said it might be up to 20 % of corn cultivation in his farm in north of the state of the; the state is the largest soybean growing state in the United States.
Soybean is less than corn per acre, but less fertilizer is needed, which makes soybean generally less costly.
If farmers turn to end-Value Corn, it may be cost-raising, but will benefit some businesses, including the andersons inc fertilizer dealer.
Andersons Executive Director Pat Bowe said on the reuters that he expected to turn corn in favor of fertilizer use.
Bayer is also expected to benefit from a farmer's diversion of corn.

Standing in this dimension of dimension, China's advocacy for building big family instead of a small coterie, insisting on the idea of building up the concept of multilateralism, rather than making it to the winner, is in response to the trend of the times. It is the inevitable choice to tackle global challenges and solve the world's problems. The common appeal of most countries in the world.
There are advanced ideas, and more solid actions.
China's "all along the way" initiative has become the largest international platform for cooperation.

Good offices international hot spot, addressing climate change, participating in peacekeeping operations, reducing poverty poverty and helping other countries to implement the 2030 sustainable development agenda.
China has become an important pillar of multilateralism, as United Nations Secretary-General Cuba has said.
When the world faces a "Trust Deficit" that has intensified, when populist and polarization trends look up, it is the world's most pressing moment for multilateral cooperation.

On the night of September 20, 20, the joe classmate, who was reading the big three in zhengzhou, took a ride to the crane wall.
A man on the train bought a ticket without a ticket, but took her seat: " take a shot
Two hours of ride, the train chief advised him to remain invalid for an hour.
In the end, a male passenger in the car was not able to take a look at the man.
From public opinion, although the final result is mostly the public condemnation of the naha, the public security department's administrative sanction, and even the integrity blacklist, the public still feels that it is not ". Why can't the naha be punished on the spot?
Why can't it stop its immoral and even illegal behavior on the spot, but after it can punish it?
And why is it just a male passenger who is " seeing inequality " and pulling it up for the unreasonable act of " Uncle bully
The main reason is that only a long-haul train is equipped with a marshals, and short trains are generally not available; even if there is a marshals, the marshals is too concerned about the possible rogue reaction of the naha without taking coercive measures.
The repeated incidents of rebar have made people realize that it is necessary to let the naha be forcibly taken away from even being punished for a deterrent effect.
This requires that our train marshals dare to take strong measures in time and that trains without the marshals should be configured as soon as possible to protect and combat violations in a timely manner.

In a poor village in a western county, there is only one convenience store in the village, walking into the store, some goods are vu, " Arowana " is marked as " Golden Dragon Oil " mong zai " became " milk " there is a lot of goods.
Over the years, similar phenomena have been frequently exposed, and some of the rural fake commodity products are branded, similar, similar to packaging, and false and false.
A consumer survey published in a western city has revealed that the problem of Ultra-fake rural business is serious, with 66 % of users buying fake goods in the supermarket offline supermarket, which is more than half of the food.
As the departments concerned are working on the rural market, why are "Lee Ghost" still constantly playing?
Unlike Urban Markets, farmer s' awareness of rights is relatively weak, plus many rural locations are remote, in the blind spots of regulatory power, so that fake goods have breeding soil.
A commodity head tube, some department-Tube Price, some tube production, some tube market, function crossover, year-end fraud, concentrated management of wind, fake, and the show of fake, and slowly popping out, just finished the old fake, new fake again come out.
The lack of long-term regulatory mechanisms, the difficulty of purifying rural markets, low legal costs and big interests have led to a number of illegal vendors who have moved the " countryside " of their minds, and some rural areas have become a " scrap market
From subsistence to well-being, farmers are moving towards developing consumption.
Recently, the central committee and the state department released a number of comments on perfecting the consumer system's mechanism to further stimulate the consumption potential of the residents, which proposes to boost the consumption of echelon by Rural residents, with the aim of allowing farmers to " consume " " willing to consume " and " dare to consume let rural consumption really come up.
On the one hand, we need to deepen reform, eliminate market regulatory politics, head management disadvantages, local conditions, sound food safety, product quality monitoring network, constantly compress rural fake and sell fake space.
On the other hand, it is necessary to step up enforcement efforts to regulate "capillaries" and do not allow fake and fake people to breed in rural areas.
To punish the pit farmers is the protection of farmers. No matter how hidden the counterfeiters are, they should not be the reason for the breeding of fake and bad goods. The relevant departments should clear their duties, the grass-roots regulatory forces are sinking, which link is the problem, and the responsibility should be held accountable, and the counterfeiting will be made. The sale of fake people is nowhere to hide.
Yim put the market into the market, put on a strict eligibility review for the production operators, put the market in circulation, let the products go to the road, the road to clear, from the source, the root of the root, let the legal dealer be comfortable, let the farmers buy assured.
Activating rural consumption to guide health consumption needs.
With the escalation of consumption, many farmers not only pursue eating, eating well, but also pursuing high-quality life such as culture and health, and cannot bring rural markets to " Low-quality " " Cheap " Society.
This needs to promote the extension of e-Commerce to the vast countryside, the two-way marketing channel of the city and township, promote the integration of offline industrial development platform and online e-Commerce Trading Platform, and support the new model of consumption of new models to the rural market; push for the conditional township to be promoted. Business Logistics and leisure Agriculture, country tourism, product processing and other organic combination; sound rural modern circulation network system, optimize the integration of stock facility resources, and effectively reduce the cost of rural circulation.
To create a clear, reassuring market environment for rural areas, so that farmers can't spend their lives, rural consumption can be more and more prosperous, so that the sense of the farmer's consumption can be improved.
