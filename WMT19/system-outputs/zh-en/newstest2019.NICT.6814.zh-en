According to the British media, the US Navy's Deputy Secretary of Operations, Admiral William Moran, said that even as the US Navy is revitalizing its strength to deal with an increasingly worrying Russia on both sides of the Atlantic, the US continues to focus on the Asia-Pacific region - which is expanded to include the Indian Ocean - Asia-Pacific - by the Five Point Building.
The United States listed China and Russia as strategic rivals in its new defense strategy, published at the beginning of the year, according to a report on the website of Jane's Defense Weekly on September 24.
Since then, the US Navy has restored the Second Fleet in order to more directly counter Russian activities.
The moves have raised some questions and concerns among allies and analysts who fear the US Navy could stay away from the "Asia-Pacific rebalancing" strategy that marked the Obama administration, the report said.
But Admiral Moran said the U.S. Navy's focus remains on the Western Pacific.
"There has been no major change for us," he said on January 24, 2018, at a round-table discussion entitled "Meeting the High Seas Challenge," hosted by the National Asia Research Agency of the United States in Washington.
"The focus is still on rebalancing, shifting the center of gravity or whatever you want to describe it," Moran said.
He acknowledged, however, that the United States is closely linked to Europe.
"We will continue to look at the growth of the West Coast and balance what we can do," he said.
While Moran pointed out that the overall policy on Russia falls within the purview of the US Defense Secretary, he warned that "Russians may face demographic and economic challenges, but history has proved that if we conflict with them, they will be very tough."
Admiral Moran said that as part of a renewed US operation against Russia, China and other competitors, the US Navy is dynamic in deploying its troops into a "new mode of warfare," which will help make it difficult for opponents to figure out where the US mother combat group or other assets will be deployed at any given time and place.
"We, the Navy and the Navy, support it - the concept of unpredictable warfare, not to be in the same place again and again, almost like a swastika - that's our way of doing it," he said.
According to the report, the first to try this new practice was the "Harry Dulumen," a mother combat group whose early deployment included working visits to the port as well as patrolling in areas that usually only pass through.
Moran said the U.S. Navy is currently working to make sure allies know that the warships will still patrol traditional areas, and is also working on logistical and family liaison issues for the new deployment process.
Lt. Gen. Michael Nunan, the commander of the Royal Australian Navy, also spoke at the event, saying that the Australian military could work with the United States' mother-of-war group.
That will continue, he said, as the Royal Australian Navy plans to purchase nine more frigates equipped with a "Mars Shield" combat system.
From October 5, a number of airlines will raise or resume fuel storage fees. Next Friday, they will have to pay more for aircraft travel.
Yesterday, Xiangpeng Airlines, Okai Airlines and other airlines announced that, starting from October 5, 2018 (the date of departure), domestic routes will charge $20 per passenger for fuel transportation on routes under 800 km (including), and $30 per passenger on routes over 800 km.
Xiangpeng Air, Okai Air and other companies announced that from 0 o'clock (departure date) on October 5, 2018, the standard for charging fuel parking fees for domestic routes under 800 km (including) has increased from 10 yuan per person to 20 yuan per person, while the standard for charging fuel handling fees for domestic routes above 800 km has increased from 10 yuan per person to 30 yuan per person per passenger.
Children and military and police personnel are all 10 yuan / person; infants continue to be exempt from collection.
According to the person-in-charge of the ticket, the airline has indicated in the notice that the collection of fuel parking fee is subject to the original departure date. When the ticket is changed, the fuel parking fee will not be paid back.
This means that domestic air tickets issued before October 5 will not have to be paid in accordance with the new standard if they are to be changed to October 5 (including).
Since June 5, 2018, a number of airlines, including Air China, Eastern Airlines, Sea Airlines, Shanghai Airlines, Spring and Autumn Airlines, Shenzhen Airlines, Western Airlines and Okai Airlines, have resumed charging the cancellation of the domestic airline fuel storage fee for three years, with a standard of RMB 10 per person.
This time, Xiangpeng Airlines and Okai Airlines took the lead in announcing an increase in fuel storage fees. As of the press release, they have not yet seen the announcement of the four major domestic airlines to follow up the adjustment.
It is also understood that the Civil Aviation Department of Hong Kong has stipulated that airlines can decide whether to charge fuel storage fees at their own discretion from November.
Cathay Pacific announced at the earliest on September 27 that it would recharge fuel storage fees from November 2.
According to the Cathay Pacific website, all air tickets issued or re-issued by Cathay Pacific and Cathay Pacific on or after November 2 will include fuel parking fees for long-distance flights to and from Hong Kong and the South West Pacific, North America, Europe, the Middle East and India, and Africa, with fuel parking fees of $652 and short-haul flights of $146.
The cost is applicable to all ticket types, calculated according to each flight section, and includes the ticket price quoted in all direct distribution channels of Cathay Pacific.

Japan's Itojong Commercial on Friday recognized a $1.3 billion reduction in the value of its investment in China's Sino-Credit shares, reducing its largest corporate investment transaction due to trade tensions between China and the United States.
In May 2016, in Tokyo, Japan, a man walked past the headquarters of the Phuangzhu Society.
The company said that the trade war hit its U.S. grain division, Gao Hong, and that it had suspended financial transactions in agriculture.
A number of Japanese heavy equipment manufacturers, telecommunication companies and others have warned of the impact of Sino-US trade friction when they announced their latest results, and these Japanese trading houses have now joined the ranks.
The United States and China have imposed tariffs on each other's hundreds of billions of dollars of goods, and US President Donald Trump has threatened to extend the tax to more than $500 billion of Chinese goods to the United States if the dispute cannot be resolved.
The impact of the trade dispute on China's economy is likely to be even greater next year, according to Itojong's commercial finance chief, Yu Hachimura, who said that the impact of the trade dispute on China's economy is likely to be greater.
Itojong Commercial and Thai Bypi Group invested US $10 billion in Sinn Fein in 2015, acquiring a 20% stake in the company.
According to Hachimura, Itojong Commercial has made a total loss of 143.3 billion yen (US $1.3 billion) on this portion of its shares because it does not believe that the shares of China Credit will recover in the near future.
Itojong Commercial maintained its profit forecast for the financial year ending March 31, 2019 at 500 billion days.
In July, China imposed a 25% tariff on US soybean imports in an effort to counter Washington's moves in the face of trade friction.
"Our grain business has been hit by the trade friction between the United States and China," said Pi Hong, the finance minister.
He said Gao Hong has stopped financial transactions in his accounts since September.
Gao Hong spokesman Pat Burke said in a draft statement on Friday that the company's move was "in accordance with internal policy restrictions and due to a lack of market opportunities."
He also said the suspension of financial transactions would not lead to job losses.
Pao Hong maintains an annual profit forecast of 230 billion days, which is supported by paper pulp and paper making and power generation.
Sumitomo Commercial on Thursday reported a 16% rise in profits between April and September, stressing that "the trade problems between the United States and China have led to uncertain prospects."
Sanping Commercial on Friday raised its annual profit forecast to a record level, attributed to higher coking coal production and higher prices for commodities such as oil and coal.
The company also announced a new business plan, aiming to increase its profit for the financial year ending March 31, 2022 to 900 billion yuan (US $7.98 billion), up from the US $640 billion forecast for this year.
According to a comprehensive report by CNN.com on November 5, the voting in the mid-term elections in the United States has entered a reverse period.
On November 4, President Trump and his Democratic rivals actively "urged" their core voters to vote.
Both major parties pointed out that the voter vote rate will be the key to influencing the electoral situation.
In the 48 hours before the popular vote in the United States, it was reported that Trump was busy attending the Republican candidates' event, while former President Barack Obama traveled to Indiana to stand up for Democratic federal Senate candidate Joe Donnelly, who was in a rush to vote, and to call out his final pre-election appeal to the crowd.
"You have to go to the polls on Tuesday, you have to vote," Trump said on November 4, when he took the stage for Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kempp in Meghan, Georgia.
"The contrast in this election cannot be clearer."
The political enthusiasm of voters has risen to a rare peak, with early voting in some states well above usual.
As the president of the United States faces the first mid-term elections, the number of members of Congress of his party is often reduced.
Republicans can benefit from the economic assessment and Trump's strict focus on border security, although the Democratic Party's federal House of Representatives has maintained an edge, according to a new popular tone released by The Post and ABC News on the 4th.
According to popular opinion, registered voters favor more Democratic House candidates than Republicans, 50% to 43%, but the lead is still down from 14 percentage points in August.
Another popular note by NBC and Walking Street Daily also showed that Democrats are still seven points ahead of Republicans.
"When people don't tell the truth, when words no longer represent anything, there is bound to be bad results," Obama told the crowd at Senator Donnelly's event.
When people can only lie to themselves, democracy can't work. "
"The only way to stop the behavior of these Republicans right now is for you and your vote."
The Democratic Party faces its most difficult election in decades in the Senate, with the Republican Party now holding a half-dozen seats.
But the House of Representatives is more favorable, and Democrats need to win another 23 seats to take control of the 435-seat House of Representatives.
Analysts at FiveThirty.com, a polling website, have estimated that Democrats are 85% likely to win the House.
The National Political Association held an important ideological and theoretical symposium on strengthening and improving the work of the People's Political Association. Wang Yang attended and delivered a speech.
The National Political Association held an important ideological and theoretical workshop on strengthening and improving the work of the People's Political Association in Beijing from 29 to 30.
Wang Yang, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the National Political Association, attended the meeting and made a speech.
He stressed that the important thoughts of the General Secretary of the People's Political Consultative Association on strengthening and improving the work of the People's Political Association of the People's Republic of China have explained in depth the role of the People's Political Association, its goals, duties, missions and practical requirements. Scientific answers to a series of major questions of a directional, comprehensive and strategic nature have served as a powerful ideological weapon guiding the work of the People's Political Association in the new era.
We should earnestly study and implement this important idea, grasp its great significance, enrich its connotation and spiritual essence, make real efforts in learning and understanding, and promote the improvement of the quality of the work of the political association by means of theoretical study and ideological force, so as to effectively fulfill the new mission of the People's Political Association in the new era.
From September 29 to 30, the National Political Association held a symposium in Beijing on the important ideological and theoretical aspects of strengthening and improving the work of the People's Political Association.
Wang Yang pointed out that since the 18th CPC National Congress, the General Secretary of the People's Congress of the People's Republic of China has proposed a series of new ideas and new ideas on strengthening and improving the work of the People's Political Association. For the first time, the People's Political Association is an important channel for socialist consultative democracy and a special consultative body. It is an important part of the national governance system. It is the first time to clarify the characteristics and advantages of the new political system of the new party and the relationship of the relationship of the people.
Wang Yang stressed that the political associations at all levels should take theoretical study and study as an opportunity to further identify the weak points and shortcomings of the work of the political cooperation, make efforts to strengthen and improve and seek breakthroughs.
It is necessary to comprehensively strengthen the construction of the Party's political association system and ensure that the decision-making and deployment of the Central Committee of the Party are carried out in the work of the CPC.
It is necessary to strengthen ideological and political leadership, improve the system, procedures and mechanisms for the establishment of ideas and policies and the building of a consensus on "two-way development," and implement ideological and political leadership into all aspects and the entire process of the work of the post.
We should focus on the responsibility of the central task, better comply with the service party and the national bureau, improve the quality of the construction and administration, and enhance the effectiveness of the post.
It is necessary to strengthen the building of the political association itself, ensure the education and training of its members and cadres, give play to the fundamental role of the special committee, and strengthen the foundation for the political association to assume its duties.
It is necessary to strengthen guidance on the work of local political associations, guide them in their direction, make demonstrations and solve difficult problems, and raise the overall level of the work of the political associations.
In order to thoroughly study and implement the socialist ideology with Chinese characteristics and the spirit of the 19th CPC National Congress in the new era, the National Political Association System began to carry out the important ideological study and research activities of the General Secretary of the CPC on strengthening and improving the work of the People's Political Consultative Association in May, and held eight regional forums and seven expert and academic forums.
Beijing, November 5 (Wang Xiaoyan) Under the current wave of "mass entrepreneurship and innovation," more and more technology companies have begun to attach importance to patent research and development and related protection work, digging deep into the potential value of patents and occupying market dominance.
In the same way, many scientific and technological enterprises have encountered a lot of infringement in terms of patent technology licensing, patent technology use, and so on.
At the end of 2017, Tan Wei, He Jiehong and Li Bin, from Guangdong Province, filed a lawsuit with the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court against the developer Beijing Xiaolong Technology Co., Ltd. (Hereinafter referred to as Xiaolong Technology), operator Drop Travel Technology Co., Ltd., and the seller Guangdong Pacific Internet Information Service Co., Ltd. (Hereinafter referred to as Guangdong Pacific), on the grounds of patent infringement.
The plaintiff requested the court to order that the defendant immediately stop manufacturing, selling, promising to sell and using the patent of the plaintiff.
On October 30, 2018, the China Judicature Network published the "first instance ruling on the patent infringement dispute between Tan Wei, He Guohong and Beijing Xiaolong Technology Co., Ltd.," revealing the details of some of the cases in which APP was sued for patent infringement by drip-dropping travel.
The third plaintiff held that the patent holder and the owner of the "mobile terminal-based carpool service system and method" patent, and that the entire operation process of the application of the "dribble vehicle" in the "drop travel" APP was corresponding to the technical scheme of patent protection involved, constituted a patent infringement.
However, during the court ruling, Xiaolong Technology held that Guangdong Pacific was not a suitable defendant. It only provided a free download of the APP "drop travel" on the Internet. It did not implement the patent method involved. There was no direct or indirect infringement. It should not be listed as a defendant in this case.
Secondly, the place of infringement in this case is not in Guangdong.
According to the law, the place of infringement of the patent in question should be the place where the patent method in question is fully implemented. Therefore, the court's jurisdiction was challenged and the case was referred to the court of the defendant's residence, namely, the Beijing intellectual property court.
The Guangzhou intellectual property court held that the defendant, Guangdong Pacific, had provided APP products on its network platform for alleged infringement drips, and that it was not inappropriate for the plaintiff to list the defendant, Guangdong Pacific, as the defendant.
And the defendant was located in Guangzhou City, which belongs to the jurisdiction of the Guangzhou intellectual property court.
The defendant Xiaolong Science and Technology advocated that the case should be referred to the Beijing Intellectual Property Court for trial. On the basis of insufficient evidence, the defendant Xiaolong Science and Technology Co., Ltd. rejected the objection to the jurisdiction of the case and incurred the costs of accepting the case of the jurisdiction objection.
At present, the other proceedings in this case have not been made public, and the reporter will also pay close attention to the details of the follow-up to the patent fraud case.
Interview with the Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Scientific and Industrial Research Organization of Georgia: The achievements of the cooperation between Australia and China in science and technology are remarkable.
"China's science and technology have developed rapidly in the past few decades, and Australia and China can achieve great results by working together in the field of science."
Larry Ma, chief executive of the Federal Scientific and Industrial Research Organization of Georgia, said in a recent interview with reporters from the China-Singapore News Agency in Beijing that the cooperation between Australia and China in the field of science and technology, from combating climate change to the "sky-eye" project, has shown great vitality.
As the largest state-level scientific research institution in the Commonwealth of Georgia, CSIRO has made many innovative research achievements in the fields of oceans, energy, biology, materials, astronomy and other fields that have attracted world attention.
CSIRO has always maintained close cooperation with scientific research institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
"It's a long-lasting friendship that includes a tradition of trust in partners and long-term cooperation," Ma said.
In May of this year, China's 500-meter-calibre ball-surface emission telescope, the "China Sky Eyes," installed the first 19-wave L-band receiver in the world.
This 19-wave beam feed generator, which is currently the most advanced in the world, has been jointly developed by scientists from China and Australia.
Ma said that the successful development of the machine is based on the accumulated technology of CSIRO for many years. After it is launched, the speed of FAST patrol will be increased by 5 to 6 times. At the same time, more scientific observation targets will be expanded.
"This is part of CSIRO's contribution to FAST."
In addition to the above-mentioned cooperation, CSIRO also has close cooperation with Chinese scientific research institutions in the construction of a square-kilometre array emitter telescope, research and development of new fuel technologies, and energy conservation and emission reduction.
"In the past, scientific research has always been concerned with the problems of hundreds of years later, and now more scientific research efforts are needed to solve the problems that lie ahead."
Ma Yu believes that Australia and China are complementary in the field of scientific development, and both countries are confronted with a series of challenges in their development.
For example, extreme weather is occurring in the global frequency, drought and floods have led to reduced food production, and food shortages have seriously affected human development.
At the same time, population explosion, aging, chronic diseases and other issues are also serious challenges.
"The cooperation between Australia and China in recent years is mainly aimed at solving these current difficulties."
The International Southern Hemisphere Marine Research Center, jointly established by CSIRO and Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology, focuses on the observation of Ernino and La Nina phenomena, the study of their relationship to extreme weather, and the establishment of early warning facilities for extreme weather. The new varieties of grains developed by CSIRO and the Chinese Academy of Sciences to overcome extreme weather can also alleviate the food shortage caused by extreme weather, Ma said.
"In the current environment, it is very difficult for science and technology innovation to be completed on its own, which requires extremely high costs, and there are so many issues to be solved, so cooperation is particularly important today."
Ma said that the closer the cooperation, the more likely it will be to make breakthrough progress, which is also the meaning of strengthening cooperation between Australia and China under the framework of "One Belt and One Road."
"To strengthen bilateral cooperation, it is mainly scientific and technological cooperation for us."
As an example, Ma said that CSIRO has recently developed a gold purity method that does not use cyanide. Because the traditional gold purity method is very harmful to the environment, many countries hope to find a method of gold purity with little environmental pollution.
"We are very willing to introduce this technology into China, which is one of the achievements of our cooperation in the 'Belt and Road'."
On August 29, 2018, a special meeting on tourism promotion and project cooperation was held in the city of Urumuqi, Xinjiang. Participants at the meeting, while enjoying the achievements of the development of the chicken, could also appreciate the local cuisine and feel the heavy historical culture of the local area.
In the month prior to the event, Baoxiao carried out a series of tourism publicity and promotion activities in eight cities along the Tianshui, Pyeongcool, Lanzhou, Jinchuan, Guyuan, Xining, Zhang Yu, Hami and other silk routes.

Yan Naimin, a member of the Standing Committee of the Urumuzi Municipal Committee and deputy mayor, introduced that Urumuzi, as a heavy town of the New North Road on the Silk Road, has special geographical advantages. Since ancient times, it has been an important channel connecting the north and south of Tianshan, connecting Xinjiang with the Mainland, and connecting China with Central Asia, West Asia and Europe. It is an important window for China to open to the West and foreign economic and cultural exchanges.
With the emphasis on equipment manufacturing, logistics and commerce, and tourism industry, and with the sincere intention of seeking common opportunities for development and cooperation, the event has made a great difference in Urumuzi.

The industrial enterprises in the Northeast region are more important and better based. For the Northeast, to grasp innovation is to grasp development, and to seek innovation is to seek the future.
Whether or not the vitality of the old industrial base can be re-stimulated and released, and the general secretary's heart is affected.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Li Yong-ho told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued imposition of sanctions is deepening North Korea's distrust of the United States, and it is unlikely that North Korea will unilaterally abandon nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
At the United Nations General Assembly, Li Yong-ho said that North Korea has taken a "very friendly approach" in the past year, including ending missile and nuclear tests, dismantling nuclear test sites and committing to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we haven't seen any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"If we do not trust the United States, we will have no confidence in our national security. Under such circumstances, we cannot give up our weapons unilaterally first."
Although he repeated North Korea's complaint that the United States was opposed to "phased" de-nuclear, his speech was of great significance because it did not completely reject unilateral de-nuclearization, as North Korea had done in the past.
Li Yong-ho referred to the June 12 joint statement between Jain and Trump, when he agreed to work toward "de-nuclearizing the Korean peninsula," while Trump promised to protect North Korea's security.
North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States says North Korea must first give up its nuclear weapons.
The United States has also refused to ease its demand for international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insisted on 'de-nuclear first' and stepped up sanctions pressure to achieve its goal in a high-pressure manner, even refusing to issue a 'declaration of the end of the war'," Li said.
"The idea that sanctions can make us cry out for mercy is that people who don't know us are having a white dream.
But the problem is that this continued sanctions are deepening our distrust, "he said.
Mr. Li did not mention the plan for the second special gold meeting mentioned by the President of the United States at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, he highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Wen Jinping in the past five months and said, "If the other side of de-nuclear is South Korea, not North Korea, then the de-nuclear of the Korean peninsula will not become so rigid."
China announced that, with effect from November 1, 2018, it will reduce import tariffs for 1,585 tax purposes.
Since this year, China has taken the initiative to reduce import tariffs.
On May 1, this year, the overall tax on drugs was reduced, and the import tariff of all general drugs, including anti-cancer drugs, as well as biobase drugs with anti-cancer effect and Chinese medicine with actual import, was adjusted to zero for a total of 28 tariff purposes.
At the same time, the tax burden of value added tax on the production and import of anti-cancer drugs has also been reduced.
On July 1, the tax will be lowered on 218 vehicles and components for tax purposes.
After the tax reduction, the total vehicle tax rate in China has been lower than the average level of developing countries, which is in line with the reality of China's automobile industry.
This tax reduction will promote the structural adjustment of the industry and the optimization of the allocation of resources, accelerate the winners and losers, help to improve the quality of products and services, and hopefully promote the price adjustment of automobiles to a certain extent, so that consumers can get more benefits.
On July 1, the tax was lowered on 1,449 daily consumer goods for tax purposes.
The reduction of tax on consumer goods for daily use is closely related to the good living needs of the people.
This tax reduction is not only large in number but also strong, with an average tax reduction of 56%.
The reduction of taxes on consumer goods for daily use directly benefits consumers and promotes the competitiveness of domestic industries.
On November 1, a tax reduction will be imposed on 1,585 industrial products such as machinery and electrical equipment, spare parts and raw materials for tax purposes.
A proper reduction of import tariffs on some of China's much-needed industrial products will attract more foreign investment, help increase the domestic supply and boost the upgrading of the industry. At the same time, it will help enterprises to allocate resources on a global scale, reduce production costs, and reduce the pressure borne by the domestic environment.
According to the relevant person in charge of the office of the State Council's Customs and Tax Commission, the above four autonomous tax reductions, as well as the third step reduction implemented on July 1 this year on the basis of the outcome of the negotiations on the expansion of the scope of the information technology agreement, will reduce the total tariff level of China from 9.8% in the previous year to 7.5%.
The adjusted total tariff level is slightly higher than that of the EU, which is lower than that of most developing countries, and is at a moderately low level, which is basically compatible with the status and stage of development of China's developing countries.
The person in charge introduced that the overall level of tariffs, as one of the important indicators of the degree of openness of China's industrial and commercial sectors, should be compatible with the stage of China's economic development and reflect the characteristics of the times.
As China is the first country in the world in terms of the size of its trade, it already has the economic foundation for further expanding and opening up. However, the quality and benefits of trade development are still different from those of the developed economies. Therefore, the overall level of tariffs should be appropriately reduced.
Customs duties are a means of protecting compliance. Tariff levels should be compatible with industry competitiveness, and benign competition should be encouraged. Excessive protection is not conducive to industrial development and quality improvement.
The adjustment of tariff rates should take into account production needs and consumption needs.
Emphasis will be placed on reducing the commodity tax rate, which is large in domestic demand and conducive to industrial transformation and upgrading. Efforts will be made to increase the import of characteristic and advantageous products where the needs of the people are relatively concentrated. The sense of access of enterprises and the public will continue to be enhanced, so as to meet the needs of upgrading the industrial structure and consumption structure.
The strength of tax reduction should take into account the ability of fiscal revenue and industrial development.
It is necessary to coordinate and coordinate the two domestic and foreign markets, both upstream and downstream, as well as production and consumption, in the selection of specific goods for tax reduction and the magnitude of tax reduction, so as to maintain the momentum of China's steady and sound economic growth.
The person in charge stressed that this year marks the 40th anniversary of the reform and opening-up, and that China's initiative to reduce the overall level of import tariffs is a major measure in line with China's own needs to achieve high-quality development, which is conducive to making overall use of both international and foreign resources, promoting the improvement of the quality of the domestic supply system and meeting the needs of the people for consumption upgrading.
This action and measure shows that China will firmly adhere to a mutually beneficial and win-win strategy of opening up, firmly support economic globalization, firmly uphold the principle of free trade and the multilateral trading system with the WTO as the core, continue to draw development impetus from opening up to the world, and make China's development better benefit the world.
Serbia has announced that it will enter the highest state of war. The President of the Russian Federation will meet tomorrow to discuss the situation in Kosovo.
Citing sources from the Office of the President of Serbia, Nantong news agency said that in view of the occupation by the Kosovo armed forces of access to the water storage lake at the Gazivoda water power station in northern Kosovo, which is controlled by the Belgrade side, President Vucic of Serbia ordered the country's armed forces to enter a state of maximum combat readiness.
On September 29, the Minister of Defense of Serbia, Vulin, declared that the Serbian military had entered full combat readiness.
Wulin stressed that as long as the order issued by Vučic remains in force, Serbia will continue to monitor the current situation in Kosovo, and the SDF will respond regardless of the direction of the situation.
On September 29, Vucic said in an interview that he had briefed the United States, Russia and Europe on the current situation, and that he would travel to Moscow on October 2 to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to seek Putin's support on the issue of Kosovo, according to Russia's Tass news agency.
When asked if Serbia needs the same military support from Russia as Syria, Vucic gave a negative answer: "I don't want a major military conflict on our territory."
Vucic also said that the SDF entered full combat readiness only to create a deterrent to prevent the conflict, but it was also a clear warning that no violence would ever be tolerated in Kosovo.
The reason why the SDF has raised its combat readiness is related to two major moves on the part of Kosovo.
According to the Serbian side, in recent days, the Republic of Macedonia has been carrying out extensive arrests of ethnic Serbs living there for generations in the northern part of Kosovo, and these arrested Serbs have not violated any laws.
According to Vučic, since March 26 this year, the head of the Office of the Government of Serbia in Kosovo and Metohija, Marko Yuliqi, was beaten and detained by the Kosovo Albanian Army, the situation in the region has continued to escalate, and the ethnic Albanian people have been arrested and removed from the country without humanity.
In addition, more than 100 people, including the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Kosovo, which has recently announced its own establishment, including the ROWF, armed police and snipers, have occupied positions near the water storage lake at the Gazivada water power station, entered the ecological and sports center near the dam in the northern part of the Kosovo region and blocked all nearby roads, which were previously controlled by the Serbian side.
Vucic pointed out that this military venture in Kosovo was carried out with the encouragement of Western countries, and that the actions of the Kosovo army did not notify the Serbian side in advance, in violation of Chapter 9, paragraph 1, of the Brussels Agreement, as well as UN Security Council Resolution 1244 and the military technical agreement between Serko.
Vucic has spoken to NATO Secretary-General Sturtenberg to criticise Western countries for their false rhetoric on the Kosovo issue.
The root cause of the current conflict is still hundreds of years of historical feud between the two communities in the Kosovo region.
With regard to the ownership of Kosovo, the Serbs and the Arabs each have their own statements.
Serbia regards Kosovo as the birthplace of the nation and a cultural basket, because Serbia built its most prosperous country here in the 12th century, and the ethnic Albanians only moved in large numbers after the invasion of the Ottoman Empire and the defeat of the Serbian army to the north.
Ethnic Albanians, on the other hand, maintain that Ilians, the original tribe that lived in Kosovo in the 4th-5th century BC, are the ancestors of ethnic Albanians, and therefore Kosovo has been the territory of the Albanian people since ancient times.
The subjective political division has led to violent conflicts between different ethnic groups, religions and cultures, and has resulted in a fierce confrontation between ethnic Serbs and ethnic Albanians in the Kosovo region.
In 1912, the Kosovo Albanians first declared the independence of Albania.
Since the beginning of the first century, a large number of ethnic Albanians living in the Antarctic peninsula have moved to Turkey, and the proportion of Serbs has risen relatively. In the view of the Serbs, the practice of "just taking back their own land" has been regarded by the Albanians as a "Greater Serbianism," which has led to conflict between the two communities.
Kosovo has become the "powder keg" of the Balkans.
In 1999, the armed conflict between the Albanian separatists in the Kosovo Liberation Army and the Serbian army and police led to the bombing of the southern alliance of Serbia and Montenegro by NATO troops and the outbreak of war in Kosovo.
On 17 February 2008, Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia.
Since then, despite news that Serbia will normalize relations with Kosovo and sign a global and legally binding agreement, it has not been possible to sign an agreement that is subject to multiple forces, such as the United States, Europe and Russia, due to historical national grievances and geopolitical constraints.
Just a month ago, Vucic made it clear for the first time that he advocated the separation of the Serbs from the Albanian ethnic group in Kosovo, and once again made the conflict between the two communities public.
Power communications continue to disrupt Indonesia's strong earthquake and tsunami relief difficulties
According to figures released by Indonesia's disaster relief agency in the early hours of August 30, the powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck Dungara County in the country's central Sulawii province on August 28 have killed 420 people.
According to the head of Indonesia's disaster relief agency, Wilem Rammergilei, the figure is only a preliminary count of the city of Paru, the capital of Central Sulawii province, about 80 kilometers from the earthquake. Because of the lack of large search and rescue machinery, many of the hotel, shopping mall, warehouse and other intensive buildings in the city that were damaged by the earthquake have yet to be searched.
On September 29, 2018 local time, a bridge damaged by the earthquake and tsunami collapsed into several sections in Baba Road, Indonesia.
Due to the severe damage to power and communication facilities, Donggara County and the adjacent Siji District are still unconnected "lonely islands" and cannot count the number of victims.
Indonesia's Vice President Kala said the death toll may be in the thousands, according to media reports.
Power disruption, communication disruption, road disruption, airport damage... Strong earthquakes and post-tsunami relief efforts have been very difficult.
Due to power cuts, some hospitals and rescue settlements in Palu have to rely on fuel to generate electricity.
The road to and from the city was blocked by a mountain landslide, and large transport vehicles, including fuel trucks, were unable to enter, making the supply of fuel very tight.
Indonesian Social Minister Agus said that as a result of the road damage, emergency relief supplies such as tents, bed pads, woolies, clothing, food, household supplies and other emergency supplies transferred by the ministry from the provinces of South Sulawii and Goren, which are adjacent to the earthquake zone, have not yet arrived in the disaster area.
Relief materials transferred from the capital, Jakarta, are being transported to the disaster area via air force transport aircraft.
In view of the damage caused by the earthquake to the command tower and runway at Paru airport, all commercial flights have been suspended to ensure safety and rescue, and only military aircraft carrying relief supplies and personnel have been brought down.
The Indonesian Minister for Political, Legal and Security Affairs, who directed the rescue efforts in the earthquake zone, Virento, demanded that power supply and commercial airport flight services be restored as quickly as possible to ensure the operation of relief agencies such as hospitals, so that more rescue workers, volunteers and aid supplies can reach the disaster-stricken areas.
On August 28, a series of powerful earthquakes occurred in Dungara County, Central Sulavi Province, Indonesia. Among them, a magnitude 7.7 strong earthquake at 17: 02 local time triggered a tsunami, resulting in major disasters in Palu City, Dungara County and Siji District.
In the past few days, Beijing has continued to open the most beautiful blue sky model, attracting thousands of people in the capital to show their happiness on social platforms, saying that "under the blue sky and white cloud, the 'drunk' sky is the best business card for Beijing."
Since August, Beijing has welcomed the "bluest sky."
Inside the capital, people can be seen on the spot at any time, holding smart mobile phones, or holding a single camera to take photos.
On social platforms such as Weibo and WeChat, the old palace, Tianan Gate, bird's nest, Hu Ju... The different types of buildings display different beauty against the blue sky.
Some Internet users said that such a "wind-light blockbuster" is the best urban propaganda film in Beijing. Others said that if such a blue sky is painted for a long time, people with cervical spondylosis will be able to cure it. Others hoped that "this blue will be able to cross the winter into the summer, so that the sky of the capital will be blue for four seasons."
Why do the people of the capital particularly love the blue sky?
Because the people who lived in the city in the past suffered from the fog, they were particularly eager for the blue sky. After the "Blue Sky Defense War" was launched in Beijing, and the air quality was continuously improved, the fog became smaller and the blue sky increased, and the happiness enjoyed by the people in their eyes was particularly important.
On the day of Guoqing Festival, the weather in Beijing was fine.
At 8 o'clock in the morning, the majority of the 35 air quality monitoring stations in the city were shown to be "first-class excellent" green.
The "Bluest Sky" theme photography competition on the social platform, which is spontaneous by the public, is still ongoing.
Why is the sky so blue in Beijing recently?
According to the person in charge of the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau, in August this year, the average concentration of fine grains (PM2.5) in Beijing was 35 ug / m3, a record for the same period in the past five years.
The PM2.5 real-time concentration in September was even more frequent in single digits.
A major factor behind the emergence of the "bluest sky" is that the weather conditions have been generally favorable in recent times. More importantly, Beijing has carried out atmospheric pollution control on a permanent basis, vigorously promoted the clean air action plan in the past five years, and continuously released environmental benefits, thus reducing the total emission of pollutants in the region, all of which have laid the foundation for the continuous improvement of air quality.
Beijing officially issued and implemented the Beijing Clean Air Action Plan 2013-2017 in 2013.
According to the plan, the government has continuously guided non-capital functions to be eliminated, and pushed forward the work of energy clean replacement and pollution reduction. A total of 4,923 coal-fired boilers have been eliminated.
As a result, Beijing has also become the first large city in the Mainland of China to realize full-network natural gas.
The data showed that between 2013 and 2017, the cumulative average annual concentration of PM2.5 in Beijing decreased by 35.6%; the number of days when the air quality met the standards increased by 50 days; the number of days when the first class was excellent increased by 25 days; the total number of days of heavy pollution decreased by 35 days; and the incidence of heavy pollution decreased significantly.
While the air quality continues to improve, Beijing officials, based on a new round of PM2.5 source analysis, released in September this year the "Three-Year Action Plan for Beijing's Winning Blue Sky Defense War," which focuses on the current governance phase and pollution characteristics, focuses on key prevention and control areas such as diesel trucks, dust raising, volatile organic matter management, optimizing the transport structure, industrial structure, energy structure and land use structure, strengthening the regional linkage control, and strengthening the city of the city of the city of the city of the city, and the city of the city of the city.
During the Golden Week of Guoqing this year, the municipal tourism committee, industry and commerce, city administration, public security and other relevant departments will strengthen the law enforcement inspection of the "one-day tour" market, and focus on the "six-black" chaos of tourism. Once found out, violators of the law will be punished in accordance with the law.
On the morning of the first day of the month, the municipal government held a special meeting on "One-Day Tour" to severely combat illegal "One-Day Tour," and made plans for a special operation to further crack down on the illegal "One-Day Tour."
At the meeting, it was revealed that the focus on black ticket, black guide, black society, black car, black shop and black net interests chain interwoven with the "six black" chaos, and the city has launched a special campaign to crack down on illegal "one-day tour" since July 28.
Since the launch of the special action, the city has accepted 39 complaints of "one-day travel," a decrease of 63%. Since this year, the city has accepted 270 complaints of "one-day travel," a decrease of 62%.
In the past two months, the city has seized 248 "black cars," checked 158 cases of illegal travel passenger business, closed 29 shopping "black shops" and performance venues, inspected 13 "black clubs" and 27 "black guides," confiscated 26,000 illegal advertisements, dismantled 31 illegal "one-day travel" advertising plates, handed over 3 false station plates, checked various types of illegal travel operators, and imposed a fine of 1.81 million yuan for various illegal travel operations.
As a result, the illegal "one-day tour" disorder has been basically contained, and the market order of "one-day tour" has shown a stable and positive trend.
According to the report, in recent years, the city has continuously stepped up its efforts to rectify the illegal "one-day tour."
In 2016 and 2017, the Municipal Tourism Committee accepted 1612 complaints and 897 complaints of "one-day travel," a decrease of 79% and 44% respectively. However, illegal "one-day travel" continued to beat and rebound from time to time, and formed a "six-black" mess with black ticket, black guide, black club, black car, black shop, black net and other interests.
In particular, illegal travellers in the street are known as "Black Tickets," illegal websites that publish false travel information are known as "Black Nets," travel agencies engaged in illegal "one-day travel" or agencies or individuals without travel agency qualifications are known as "black clubs," "black guides" who are employed by the "Black Club," and who use vehicles that are not qualified for tourist travel, or which provide "black travel services" for illegal "tourists.
In this special operation, the city has continuously stepped up its fixed inspection and mobile inspection of illegal "one-day travel". In response to the high frequency of illegal "one-day travel" and the high impact of tourism routes, the relevant departments sent a secret visit team to accompany the delegation on a daily basis. After discovering the evidence of illegal violations, they made a rigorous inspection according to law.
Among them, "black car" and "black shop" have become the focus of the special action.
According to the report, without the black car, the illegal "one-day tour" cannot become a line. The black car is easy to be found, remembered and checked, and is also a fixed asset with a high individual value.
The relevant departments have used the road traffic monitoring probe to increase the supervision of the tourism bus on the key "one-day tour" route, and have been able to detect the "black car" by using technological and smart means such as technology prevention and material prevention.
Because of the small number of "black shops" in tourism shopping, they have also become the focus of strict competition.
In order to strengthen the shock and crack down on illegal "one-day travel," all the competent departments shall, in accordance with the law, impose severe and severe punishment on all those who have been found to have violated the law in the special operation.
In August of this year, the city also held a symposium on the legal issues related to the strict fight against illegal "one-day tour," which discussed the means and measures of combining administrative penalty with criminal conviction.
The Municipal Tourism Committee said that in the future, more regular travel agencies will be encouraged to carry out "one-day tours" in Beijing, and the supply of regular "one-day tours" will be increased, so as to further occupy the living space of illegal "one-day tours." At present, specific plans are still under study.
In addition, the Municipal Tourism Committee has continuously improved the electronic travel list information system of tour groups to ensure that each team is under the supervision of the electronic travel list platform.
From a travel symbol to a digital economy symbol, what has the town experienced over the years
As the permanent venue of the World Internet Congress, Wucheng has received much attention on how to receive the dividend of the Summit.
From the beginning of the first World Internet Congress, in five years, the changes in the town of Wucheng have been widely seen.
In 2014, there were only 12 enterprises related to the digital economy and the Internet in the town. By the third quarter of this year, there were more than 500 enterprises.
This is a shadow of the development of the digital economy in Wucheng.
The convening of the Internet Congress has made it possible for local enterprises to accept the digital economy and digital wave at zero distance. The desire for enterprise transformation and upgrading is very strong. Traditional manufacturing enterprises have increased their investment and R & D in machine replacement and smart management.
Jiang Yu, the party secretary of Wucheng Town, said that Wucheng will build a new economic enabling center in the future.
The development of the digital economy cannot be achieved without the support of infrastructure.
This year, Wucheng launched the 5G trial site on the basis of achieving full coverage of 4G communication network and free Wi-Fi.
At the same time, as the first county-level city in the country to build a dedicated channel for Internet data, the city where Wucheng is located has also become a hot land for the development of the Internet industry.
Since the First World Internet Congress, a total of 565 projects in the digital economy have been introduced, with a total planned investment of 377.25 billion yuan. In the first three quarters of this year, the core manufacturing sector of the digital economy achieved a total output value of 8.73 billion yuan, an increase of 13% over the same period.
"Before Wucheng was a tourist symbol, and later more drama and cultural symbols. As a result of the Internet Congress, it has now become an Internet and digital economy symbol."
Hengjun, the secretary of the Xinxiang Municipal Party Committee, believes that the dividends of the World Internet Congress have accumulated over time. Therefore, it is more necessary to build a platform for the integration of talent, projects, technology and other elements of all parties.
After 20 years of working outside the country, Shenyi people returned to the countryside to start a business because of their relationship with the Internet Congress.
On December 2 last year, he walked into the 4th Internet Light Expo with a high-capacity anti-tampering digital technology solution, which was popular with a number of customers.
Shenyi chose to start a business in Wucheng not only because of his hometown relationship. "In Wucheng, it is easier to recruit people than I imagined. Our application is also fast. We have our application in Wucheng smart parking project."
A Wucheng Boulevard, which presents the spillover effect of the Internet Congress.
This road, which runs through the north and south of the township, is not only a tourist attraction, but also an industrial road.
With it as the support, Wucheng Boulevard, the establishment of the assembly area should be brought into being.
The reporter learned that in the future, Wucheng Boulevard will become the main position for the development of the rural industry. It will take the lead in applying a large number of achievements such as smart medical treatment, smart old-age care, smart government and so on. It will bring together 80% of the city's GDP industry and a large number of high-level talent.
At least 410 people have been killed in a tsunami triggered by a powerful earthquake in Indonesia
According to the Director of the Public Information Bureau of Indonesia's Jakarta Police on the evening of the 29th, the current earthquake in Central Sulawezi province has killed 410 people, 97 of whom have been identified.
A further 29 people are missing and 540 injured.
Parlour airport is still closed.
Active treatment has reached the level of developed countries, with the survival rate of early births reaching 98% in China at 29 weeks and above.
On September 30, the National Children's Medical Center and Fudan University Affiliated Pediatrics Hospital of Shanghai (Chen Jing Lu Yanyuan) revealed that they had introduced advanced Canadian methods in the lead project entitled "Quality Improvement of Predictions of Chinese NICU Inpatient Early-birth Children."
According to the results of the project, after active treatment, the survival rate of early births in China reached 98% in 29 weeks and above, which has reached the level of developed countries. However, there is still much room for improvement in the survival rate of early births and early births without complications at a very young age.
For the past 20 years, the Chinese government has paid close attention to the treatment and treatment of newborn babies.
At present, the infant mortality rate in the Shanghai area has fallen to 3.71 per thousand, which is significantly lower than the national average, and has reached the advanced level of developed countries.
Through four years of unremitting efforts, the project to improve the prognosis quality of early birth children in China's NICU has significantly improved the quality of life of early birth children.
Professor Cao Yun, director of the Neonatal Disorders Unit (NICU) of Fudan University's Affiliated Pediatrics Hospital, told reporters that while improving the survival rate of early births, paying attention to reducing the survival quality of early births, reducing the incidence of complications, improving the neurodevelopmental prognosis, and improving the overall outcome of infected children are of great significance for improving the overall survival quality and population quality of early births. This is also a key issue of concern in the field and the family of the family.
Through four years of unremitting efforts, the project to improve the prognosis quality of early births in China's NICU has included tens of thousands of infants aged 33 weeks and below. This has resulted in a 1 / 3 reduction in the mortality rate of infants born at birth and at birth weight in China. At the same time, the incidence of serious complications in early births has decreased significantly, significantly improving the quality of survival of early births.
The project aims to establish a complete, systematic and effective collaborative quality improvement method to improve the prognosis of early births and improve the level of treatment of newborn babies by establishing a nationwide network for improving the quality of newborn babies, introducing the concept of quality improvement of birth, and radiating 25 collaborative hospitals throughout China.
The Hospital of Pediatrics attached to Fudan University is joining forces with the national neonatal department to draw up guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of newborn infections based on the accumulated experience of the project, which will provide reference and guidance for the standardized diagnosis and treatment of new-born infections in China.
It is understood that in the project to improve the prognosis quality of early birth in China, the Pediatrics Hospital introduced the ESPI method into 25 large NICU in 19 provinces of the country, which is dedicated to solving the problem of early birth infection that has plagued the birth room of Chinese infants.
After more than 10 years of continuous improvement, the survival rate of early birth without complications has increased by about 1 / 3 in Canada. Canada is now one of the countries with the best prognosis for early birth in the world.
The EPPI method has now been applied to all NICU in Canada and has been adopted by six countries.
According to the Pediatrics Hospital, the results of the study showed that two years after the ESPI intervention, the number of early birth infections decreased by 35%, while the use of antibiotics decreased by 20%.
In the future, the Hospital of Pediatrics attached to Fudan University will continue to promote and implement this method nationwide, with a view to comprehensively reducing the incidence of all complications in early birth and improving the quality of treatment for newborn babies nationwide.
At present, it is a fact that there are differences and inequalities in the level of treatment in all regions of China.
According to Professor Cao Yun, as an important construction unit of the National Children's Medical Center, the Pediatrics Hospital will play a leading role in radiation. This study covers a number of western provinces including Xinjiang, Guizhou, Gangyu and western Shaanxi, with a view to gradually promoting the homogeneity and standardization of the treatment of newborn babies throughout the country.
It is understood that the Hospital of Pediatrics attached to Fudan University is joining forces with the national neonatal department to draw up guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of newborn infections based on the accumulated experience of the project, so as to provide reference and guidance for the standardized diagnosis and treatment of new-born infections in China.
It was revealed that in 2019, the coordination center, located in the China Newborn Health Network of the Pediatrics Hospital attached to Fudan University, will work with 63 hospitals across the country to carry out the next phase of national quality improvement, with a view to promoting the uniform development of the level of treatment of newborn babies in China.
Zhang Shilai, the director of the Shanghai Municipal Health and Family Planning Commission, said that Shanghai can become a central city in Asia, not only in research, but also in the construction of the entire service system. The quality of services and the results of services should have a place in Asia, thus truly reflecting the level of medical care in China.
Sinn Féin: Build the "Hero Monument" in the heart - written on the 5th Memorial Day of the Martyrs.
On September 30, on the eve of the Republic's 69-year-old Huaxuan, we celebrated the fifth anniversary of the martyrdom, and the leaders of the Party and the state, such as Xi Jinping, came to Tiananmen Square to attend the ceremony of laying a flower basket to the people's heroes.
At this moment, no matter where you are, please pay tribute to Britain.
The anniversary is a warm day and a wake-up day.
Turning over a heavy history, behind the names of each of the martyrs, is a fresh life.
They, too, have a hot youth, a true love, and concerned family members.
However, because they firmly believe that "the doctrine of our faith is the truth of the universe," they are willing to sacrifice all of their own in order to "spare the suffering of the next generation."
"I have to cry out for China one day to survive."
Across time and space, the British people set up a spiritual road sign, guiding the direction of the way forward.
"Where to come from and where to go" "What kind of person to be," read and understand English, and it's not hard to come up with an answer.
In memory of Yingliang, the most important thing is to build a "Hero Monument" in the heart.
According to incomplete statistics, since the revolutionary war years, some 20 million martyrs have dedicated their lives to national independence, the liberation of the people, and the prosperity of the country.
As a result of the planting, many ancestors did not even leave their names.
Countless Brits have poured their ideals with fresh blood, used life to practice their faith, remembered their English name, and passed on their spirit, which is to protect the roots and souls of the nation.
This "Hero Monument" does not allow for any defilement or destruction.
For some time, the undercurrent of historical nihilism, pan-entertainment and so on has been surging.
All kinds of practices that distort the history and damage the integrity of the country, challenge the conscience of justice, misrepresent the value judgment, and cause public outrage and vigilance of the whole society.
Love cannot be profane, but a hero cannot forget.
The act of touching the bottom line cannot be let go. We must dare to light the sword and defend the dignity of the United Kingdom with the rule of law and justice.
On May 1, this year, the Law on the Protection of Heroes and Martyrs was officially put into effect.
From the point of view of judicial practice, the judgments in some cases are very popular. They not only effectively safeguard the brilliant image of the British people in accordance with the law, but also release the positive energy of the hero and respect for the former.
A nation with aspirations cannot be without a hero, and a nation with ideals cannot be without a pioneer.
It has become a common social consensus for Myanmar to become a leader and call for heroes.
At present, there are a total of millions of memorial facilities across the country, and more than 100 million people visit the Martyrs' Garden each year to visit and admire them.
The human heart is the strongest foundation.
Let the hero of Zongshan, defend the hero, study the hero and care for the hero become a reality. Let the spirit of the British spirit be integrated into the blood of the nation. A "monument of the hero" will stand between the earth and the earth and the hearts of the people.
Brussels, Sept 28 - The European Union took a non-confrontation stance against Italy on Friday after Italy flunked EU demands to surprise the market with a massive budget deficit plan, but the European Union may take a more aggressive stance if Italy sticks to too bold a goal.
Italy's Eurosceptic government is targeting a budget deficit equivalent to 2.4% of gross domestic product for the next three years, suggesting that there has been no debt reduction just in the face of the demand for cuts.
"We have no interest in the crisis between the commission and Italy," the EU's Executive Committee on Economic Affairs said on Friday, taking a cautious response as the EU's recommendations and sanctions may have little impact on Italy.
EU officials and diplomats are still hoping that market forces will convince Italy to adjust its budget plan before it is formally presented to the European Commission in mid-October.
After the government announced its plans, the euro fell to its lowest level in nearly two weeks on Friday, while Italian bond yields hit their highest level in three weeks.
If the deficit target remains unchanged until the October deadline, the European Commission could veto Italy's draft budget, something it has never done to any country.
Speaking later on Friday at a meeting in the Latvian capital, Riga, the vice president of the European Union's executive committee, Donbolovski, said that Italy's current fiscal plan "appears to be inconsistent with the stability and growth pact," referring to the EU's fiscal rules.
But he did not say how it would trigger a reaction from the EU.
Bidders may submit an application to participate in the public tender before October 26 this year.
Previously, the Russian Ministry of Agriculture made China one of the priority markets for the export of Russian agricultural products.
The Russian Agricultural Supervision Bureau announced in May that for the first time in this agricultural year, Russia exported more than 1 million tons of grain to China, a record.
The bureau predicted that China could be among the top 10 food-importing countries in Russia.
After the first 3-0 victory over Spain on September 30, the Chinese women's volleyball team won 3-0 on September 30 to win the 2018 World Championships group stage in two consecutive games.
However, compared with the first battle, the Chinese women's volleyball is more difficult and dangerous.
A total of 24 teams participated in the 2018 Women's World Championships, with the Chinese women's volleyball team in Group B, along with Italy, Turkey, Bulgaria, Canada and Cuba.
Judging from the world rankings and overall strength of the teams in Group B, the Spanish team and the Italian team are the main rivals of the Chinese team.
After the game began that day, the Chinese team entered the game relatively quickly, and gained the lead at the start of the game. It maintained its advantage throughout the game. It put a lot of pressure on the opponent on the ball and the block, and took the first set with a relatively smooth 25: 18.

Nearly a thousand state-owned scenic areas have cut their ticket prices by more than half by more than 20%
[Abstract] As of September 28, various localities have put in place or published to the public measures for the free opening or reduction of prices of 981 scenic areas (74 free of charge and 907 at reduced prices). In Yunnan, the Shilin, Dali Santa, Yulongshan, Guangxi Guilin Lijiang River, Fuji Wuyi Mountain, Huangnan Zhang Jiayuan District, West Shaanxi Terracotta, Sanqing Mountain and Kas.
In order to implement the decision-making and deployment of the Central Economic Work Conference and the Report on the Work of the Government, the National Development and Reform Commission issued on June 28 the "Guidance on improving the mechanism for the formation of ticket prices in state-owned scenic areas to reduce the price of tickets in key state-owned scenic areas" (hereinafter referred to as the guidance), which calls for improving the mechanism for the formation of ticket price of state-owned scenic areas to achieve a clear reduction of the high of the key price of the price of the price.
All localities have actively carried out work in accordance with the requirements of the deployment, and have reduced the ticket prices of a number of key state-owned scenic areas in succession.
As of September 28, a total of 981 scenic areas (74 for free and 907 for reduced prices) have been implemented or published to the public in various localities. Of these, 159 are at the 5A level and 534 are at the 4A level, accounting for 70.6% of the total number of such areas.
Of the 907 scenic areas with price reductions, 491, or 54.3%, were reduced by more than 20%, while 214, or 23.6%, were reduced by more than 30%.
Yunnan, Shandong, Guangxi and western Shaanxi provinces have a large number of price reduction areas. Among them, the number of price reduction areas in Yunnan is more than 100, with an overall decrease of more than 30%.
The government of eight provinces (districts and cities), such as An Emblem and Chongqing, priced the 5A-grade scenic areas to achieve the price reduction.
A price reduction has been implemented in Yunnan Shilin, Dali Three Towers, Yulong Snow Mountains, Guangxi Guilin Lijiang River, Fuji Wuyi Mountain, Huangnan Zhang Jiayuan, West Shaanxi Terracotta Warriors, Sanqing Mountains, and Kannas, Xinjiang, among other scenic areas with high levels of social exposure.
The gradual return of ticket prices in key state-owned scenic areas to a reasonable range is conducive to accelerating the transformation and upgrading of tourism from the ticket economy to the industrial economy, from small-scale tourism to mass tourism, and from tourist attractions to tourism across the region. It is conducive to the formation of a good cycle for optimizing the supply structure of tourism and steadily expanding the demand for tourism consumption, so as to promote the sustainable and healthy development of the scenic area and tourism industry.
At the same time, the National Development and Reform Commission stressed that all localities should strengthen the standard of price order in scenic areas, guide them to upgrade their services, and ensure that the price reduction is not bad.
In addition, the National Development and Reform Commission has carried out special supervision over the recent media reports of small price reductions in individual scenic areas and the actual decline in prices. It has requested all localities to strictly deal with them, respond to social concerns in a timely manner, and effectively implement the price reductions in place.
The Trade Promotion Bureau will carry out the short and medium-term optimization work in an orderly manner.
The Macao Trade and Investment Promotion Bureau has submitted a report on the short-term and medium-term optimization of "major investment immigrants" and "skilled immigrants." At present, in addition to stepping up the promotion and implementation of all the work contained in the report, it has continuously listened to the views of the community and continuously optimized the content of the report and related work.
The Trade Promotion Bureau will introduce the related optimization work to all sectors of the community as soon as possible.
Of these, five are short-term measures implemented in the course of this year; five are medium-term measures implemented in 2019; and one is long-term measures.
In addition, under the direction of the Director of the Department of Economic Affairs and Finance, Mr Liang Weitt, the Trade Promotion Bureau also carried out a comprehensive review of the internal management system.
The five short-term measures implemented in the course of this year include:
1. Carry out inspections. Priority will be given to cases that are due to expire for seven years, cases mentioned in the ICAC report, and new renewal cases. Cases with signs of misconduct or violations will be referred to the relevant judicial authorities on their own initiative for follow-up;
2. On-site inspections of projects involving "significant investment immigrants." By late September, more than 20 investment projects had been inspected;
3. To conduct a comprehensive review of the current assessment system. Six principles for the analysis of investment projects have been re-established in the evaluation of applications for "major investment immigrants." In the evaluation of applications for "skilled immigrants," the relevant approval mechanism will be improved by specifying the elements of the development of the country and the conditions for priority recruitment of talent. At the same time, an annual list of "five industries 10 categories of workers" has been drawn up in line with the government of the government.
4. Gradually increase the transparency of information. This includes the plan to gradually publish the approval criteria, rating criteria and weight from the fourth quarter of this year, and further fine-tune and make the approval data publicly available;
5. In terms of improving the work of the confirmation mechanism, it has been requested to confirm the prior verification of the work in Australia. Major investments must be checked on site and financial statements must be submitted.
The five medium-term measures to be implemented in 2019 include:
1. Establish a mechanism to regularly listen to the views of the Talent Development Committee and the Economic Development Committee. A working meeting was held with the Economic Development Committee in September to discuss the establishment of the mechanism.
2. Requires applicants to submit financial statements made by independent third parties on an annual basis in order to keep the operation of the investment project under continuous review;
3. Further standardized and electronic processes for the application and approval of individual cases, with a view to reducing human error;
4. A comprehensive review of the current staffing, in line with the implementation of a number of optimization measures;
5. To intensify the research work on the revision of the system of temporary residence of investors, managers and specially qualified technical personnel.

On-site observation of film-free cotton and discussion and exchange activities experts from all over the country walked into the experimental field and listened to a presentation by the representative of the team of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.
On September 30, Xinjiang Shaya (Wang Xiaojun of Dandan) was located at the test site of film-free cotton cultivation in Shaya County, Xinjiang. The film-free cotton is very popular. Compared with the ground-film cotton next to it, a cluster of snow-white cotton competition is "open" and covered with branches.
From September 27 to 28, a nationwide on-site observation and discussion and exchange event on film-free cotton was held in Shaya County, Xinjiang.
The reporter learned at the observation meeting that the film-free cotton technology system, with "medium cotton 619" and its accompanying cultivation measures as the main body, has initially achieved the goal of no-film cultivation of cotton fields, reduced the pollution of ecological environment and raw cotton by the residue of cotton fields in Xinjiang, and made significant progress in the research and demonstration of the comprehensive technology of film-free cotton.
The director of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, a well-known cotton genetic grower and the chief scientist of the cotton system of the national modern agricultural industry technology system, Zhang Shizheng, introduced the growth of film-free cotton to Zhou Guoxin, the party secretary of the Zhejiang Nonglin University School.
"The comprehensive technology of film-free cotton that we have developed can completely realize the cultivation of cotton without surface film. It can completely solve the problem of residual film pollution and realize green cotton planting."
Introduction to the Academy of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.
Xinjiang is the most important cotton-producing area in China. According to the statistics of the National Bureau of Statistics, the area under cotton cultivation in Xinjiang in 2017 was 35 million hectares, accounting for 61% of the country's cotton area.
Since the introduction of the earth film into China in 1982, the area covered by various kinds of agricultural crops in the new territory has reached more than 50 million hectares, and the annual use of the earth film is around 300,000 tons.
Among them, the coverage rate of cotton mulch reached 100%, and cotton field cladding accounted for about 60% of the use of ground film in Xinjiang.
The production of film-free cotton can be measured, and the yield of cotton can completely realize the production of 320kg to 350kg.
With the continuous increase of the input volume of the earth film in Xinjiang, the recovery rate of residual earth film is low, the amount of residual film in the soil is gradually increasing, and the damage of soil structure caused by the residual film is a series of problems, which seriously affect the sustainable development of agriculture.
The residual film not only causes serious pollution to the soil, but also has a great impact on the quality of cotton fiber.
At present, more than one-third of the cotton fields in Xinjiang have achieved mechanical harvesting.
In 2017, Xinjiang will have an area of about 14 million hectares of cotton mined by machine.
During the harvest process of machine-produced cotton, a large amount of broken film on the surface and the cotton plant was collected. It was difficult to remove the broken film mixed in the raw cotton during the process of raw cotton processing. It could not be completely removed in the process of subsequent textile processing, which seriously affected the quality of textile products.
On September 28, a nationwide on-site observation and discussion and exchange event on film-free cotton was held in Shaya County, Xinjiang.
In an effort to solve the pollution of cotton fields, simplify the technology of cotton planting and improve the benefits of cotton fields, Yu Shue led his team to implement the technology of "medium cotton 619" film-free cotton cultivation over a period of eight years, so as to "add wings" to the green development of agriculture in Xinjiang.
It is introduced that through innovative new ideas of seed cultivation, a new series of "Chinese cotton 619" with special early maturity, salt tolerance, low temperature tolerance and abundant yield of land cotton was produced.
"Under the condition of film-free cultivation in the southern region of Xinjiang, a series of matching measures such as film-free planting machinery, improved planting depth, shallow burial of drips under film-free conditions, suitable seed density screening, reasonable chemical control and so on have been realized."
At present, a demonstration base for film-free cotton has been set up in Aksu, Coulle and Arar, with a yield of 4800 kg per hectare.
Cultivation of cotton without film has achieved abundant yield, conservation and environmental protection, and improved comprehensive benefits.
Zhang Donghai, the agricultural arts division of the agricultural science institute of the third division of the Xinzheng Production and Construction Corps, said that through the research and demonstration of the cultivation technology of film-free cotton in the past six years, the yield of film-free cotton seed cotton can completely realize the production of 320kg to 350kg, and possibly even higher.
"There is a great prospect for the promotion of film-free cotton cultivation technology."
Zhang Dunhai believed that at present, the cultivation technology of film-free cotton can completely solve the problem of soil residual film pollution. However, at present, there is still a certain gap between the economic benefits and the cultivation of earth film.
"The support of cotton purchase price will benefit the promotion in the future."
He said that in the next step, he and his team will continue to carry out in-depth research and extensive application of film-free cotton, make the industry of film-free cotton big and strong, and thoroughly solve the problem of soil pollution caused by the earth film.
Guangdong Sea and Land Air actively respond to Guoqing Golden Week transport - Sino-New Network
September 29 is the seventh day of the Hong Kong section of the High Rail. It is also the first weekend since the opening of the railway. The West Kowloon station is full of people.
The holiday of Guoqing Gold Week (October 1-7) is coming. In the past few days, reporters have learned from relevant departments that Guangdong railway, aviation, water transport, highway and other transport departments have actively planned to increase transportation capacity, and put in place various safeguard measures to ensure the safe and orderly transportation of passengers within the country during the Golden Week.
According to China Railway Guangzhou Bureau Group Co., Ltd. (Hereinafter referred to as "Guang Iron Group"), during the Golden Week of Guoqing this year, Guang Iron Group expects to transport 17.8 million passengers, an increase of 150.5 million, or 9.2%, over the same period.
In order to meet the travel needs of passengers, Guang Iron Group plans to open 104 additional high-speed rail trains and 85 general speed trains, mainly in the Beijing-Guangzhou, Shanghai-Kun, Guangzhou-Shenzhen, Hangzhou-Shenzhen high-speed railway and other popular routes.
Guangzhou Baiyun Airport is expected to become the busiest airport in the Mainland during the Golden Week of Guoqing this year. It is expected to receive more than 1.4 million passengers and drop more than 9200 flights.
With more and more international routes, the airport is expected to see a significant increase in international passengers compared to the past, which will be a prominent feature of this year's Golden Week holiday.
It is understood that Singapore, Bangkok, Phuket Island, Jakarta, Colombo, Maldives, Manila and other places have all been popular cities for long-term travel during this year's national celebration. The popular tourist spots such as Kathmandu, Kuala Lumpur and Bali have also continued to burst into flames. Some flights are "difficult to obtain one vote."
In particular, some airlines have increased the number of operating flights, such as: Shenzhen Airlines has added 1 Guangzhou-River flight per day; Iran Mahan Airlines has added 1 Guangzhou-Tehran flight per Saturday; and Vietnam Yuji Airlines has added 1 Guangzhou-River flight per week on Tuesday and Thursday.
In order to ensure holiday security, Baiyun Airport has stepped up its efforts to protect key posts such as "seat allocation," "baggage protection," "passenger safety inspection," and made preparations for large-scale delays in the disposal of flights.
According to Air China, the route for the Golden Week of Guoqing this year to the New Zealand, North America and Japan and South Korea regions has been very hot, while flights to Mainland Chinese tourist destinations such as Hainan, Chengdu, Hunzhou, Jiuhua, Anshan and Huangshan have also been relatively tight.
South Airlines plans to increase the number of flights by 50 during the Golden Week, including 10 flights on the Guangzhou to and from Qingmai route.
The Guangdong Maritime Bureau said that prior to the festival, it carried out a rigorous investigation of the safety risks of key ships such as the water-watching tourism vessel, the Qiangzhou Strait passenger ferry, the Pearl River Estuary high-speed passenger ship, and the ferry ferry, to ensure the stability of the water traffic security situation during the long holiday period.
During the Golden Week, the traffic volume in Guangdong Province is expected to be firmly at the top of China's list.
The Guangdong Provincial Transportation Group recently issued guidelines for the travel of motorways during the holiday season, predicting a growth of about 12% in the traffic flow of motorways.
The General Administration of Market Supervision recently issued the Notice on Strengthening the Supervision of Market Price during the mid-autumn of 2018, which requires that the supervision of housing rental and real estate prices should be strengthened, and strict measures should be taken to control the price of rental prices, the source of rental housing, the forgery of false information to raise rents, the mischarging of fees in the form of bundling services, the publication of misleading price information, and other illegal pricing practices.
The notice made it clear that price monitoring and early warning should be strengthened, and the market price dynamics should be closely monitored.
All localities should pay close attention to the daily necessities such as food, oil, meat, eggs, milk and salt, as well as the market and price changes of the special commodities consumed by local residents during the festival, and strengthen price monitoring and analysis and early warning.
As soon as it is found that the market fluctuations are oriented and initial problems, timely measures should be taken to effectively resolve them.
It is necessary to strengthen the supervision and inspection of the wholesale and retail links of daily necessities, and strengthen the monitoring frequency and supervision of places closely related to the daily consumption of the masses, such as commercial supermarkets and farmers' markets, so as to urge operators to abide by the law and operate in good faith.
The notice pointed out that it is necessary to strengthen the inspection of key areas and create a good holiday consumption environment; strengthen the supervision of gate ticket prices in state-owned scenic areas; strengthen the supervision of state-owned scenic areas by not implementing the price level or floating range prescribed by the government; increase the charging items without permission; increase the gate ticket price through the illegal setting up of "park park" tickets.
The notice requires that the supervision of the prices of necessities of daily life, especially agricultural produce, be strengthened.
As a result of seasonal changes, natural disasters and sudden outbreaks, the prices of agricultural products necessary for daily life, such as vegetables and pork, have been volatile in some regions in the recent past.
All localities should, in the light of local actual conditions, earnestly strengthen the supervision of agricultural and by-product market prices, cooperate with relevant departments to ensure the stabilization of production and market supply, and organize forces to carry out key market inspections and random spot checks.
For such commodities as pork, whose supply is tight and prices are rising rapidly, the frequency of inspection will be increased, and illegal activities such as the collection of goods, price hikes and price hikes will be strictly punished.
The notice pointed out that the regulation of prices in the housing rental and real estate sectors should be strengthened.
In mid-autumn and Guoqing, when housing rental and commercial housing sales are in full swing, all regions should pay close attention to the price behavior of real estate enterprises, intermediary companies and housing rental-related enterprises, severely rectify the rent price chain, build up rental housing sources, create false information to drive up the rent, mischarge the price by means of bundling services, release false price information, and make more efforts to clean up the market of real estate in the market.
The notice mentioned that all regions should do a good job in monitoring the prices of other parts of the tourism industry, focus on regulating the price order of the dining, lodging, shopping, tourism, entertainment and parking links, and guide operators to do a good job in the public display of clear price and fees, so as to strictly crack down on all types of illegal price practices.
According to the notice, the inspection of road, railway, civil aviation, water transport and other transport prices should be strengthened, and illegal activities such as illegal price hikes, out-of-price charges, and failure to set a clear-cut price according to regulations should be strictly investigated.
We will implement the policy of "green channels" for the transportation of fresh agricultural products and the exemption of bus toll on major holiday days.
It is necessary to innovate the means of supervision and working methods, strengthen the publicity of the price laws and regulations of commodity retail enterprises and e-commerce platforms below the line, urge operators to improve the price promotion scheme, and investigate illegal practices such as false original prices, misleading price marks and non-compliance with price commitments in accordance with the law.

Former foreign aid accused of playing a fake ball in the north in response to "no need to have" - Sinn Fein
In the afternoon of this month, the Beijing Holdings Football Club (hereinafter referred to as Northern Control) made an official response to the news that the team's former foreign aid, Anichebe, had accused the team of playing a false ball. In a statement, the north control side said that there was absolutely no case of a false kick on the part of the club. This was entirely a false lie made by Anichebe himself during the arbitration process to cover up his flagrant breach of the contract of the contract.
At the same time, Northern Control said that it would reserve the right to take all means to hold the relevant parties to account.
According to DailyMail.com, Nigerian player Anichebe has accused the International Football League of allegedly playing a fake ball against Beijing North, which he played for last year, including Beijing Derby in the 21st round of the 2017 season.
At that time, it was a crucial stage for the Beijing people and the Beijing team. The game ended with a 0-2 loss to the Beijings and Anichebi made his debut.
There was an official response to the Nigerian player's claims yesterday from the north side of the club.
The statement said that after the club's previous internal investigation, the team participated in the game did not have the situation of playing a fake ball.
Anichebe joined Beijing North in June 2017. In December of the same year, Anichebe refused to return to the team for winter training without good reason, and still refused to return to the team despite repeated calls from the club.
At present, the dispute between the two parties has been submitted to the IAAF, and arbitration is under way.
The statement also mentioned that the high-profile "false ball charge" was in fact a false lie made by Anichebe during the arbitration process in order to cover up his flagrant breach of contract and for his personal improper economic purposes.

Chinese journalists were taken away by the police at the annual meeting of the British Conservatives, and China asked for an apology
According to the website of the Chinese Embassy in the UK, the spokesman of the embassy in the UK replied to a question about a Chinese journalist who was taken away by the police during the annual meeting of the Conservatives in the UK on the 1st.

A reporter asked: On September 30, during the annual meeting of the Conservatives in the UK, the party's Human Rights Committee held a side event on the issue of Hong Kong and invited the Hong Kong opposition to speak at the meeting.
During the side meeting, a Chinese reporter was taken away by the police.
Do you have any comment?
In response, the spokesman said that in the 21 years since the return of Hong Kong to the motherland, the practice of "one country, two systems" has been a great success, and Hong Kong's development achievements are universally recognized.
Hong Kong is China's Hong Kong, and Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs.
The Conservatives' Human Rights Committee took advantage of the party's annual meeting to hold a side event for the anti-China separatist forces, and China expressed grave concern and strong dissatisfaction.
We firmly oppose any interference by any organization in the affairs of Hong Kong in any way.
Any attempt or action to promote the "independence of Hong Kong" is futile.

We ask the Conservatives' Human Rights Committee to stop interfering in China's internal affairs, stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs, and ask the organizers of the meeting to apologize to the Chinese journalists.

In a speech to the U.S. Council on Foreign Relations on Friday, Wang Yi, a member of the National People's Congress and Minister for Foreign Affairs of China, said that at present, China-US relations have once again reached a crossroads. If the two sides can look at each other in a positive and inclusive manner, expand and deepen positive cooperation, and properly manage differences and conflicts, they can open up a better future.
"The Sino-US relationship is our common asset, and we need to take care of it."
He expressed the hope that people from all walks of life in the two countries will take practical measures to safeguard the healthy and stable development of Sino-US relations and jointly promote the continuation of Sino-US relations in the right direction.
Wang Yi also stressed once again that China will surely go out of a different development path from that of the traditional big countries.
This road with Chinese characteristics has determined that China will not and will not be able to re-establish itself as a powerful country. It has also determined that China will not become the United States, will not challenge the United States, and will not replace the United States.
When Wang Yi delivered his speech entitled "Chance or challenge, partner or opponent," he said that the deep-seated sticking point of the current problem is that some American friends believe that China, too, will be strong and powerful, and will even challenge and replace the leadership position of the United States in the world.
"This is clearly a major strategic misjudgment."
But this self-imagined suspicion is spreading, he said, and has amplified existing conflicts, raised new doubts, and made it more difficult for China and the United States to solve specific problems and encounter more resistance.
Wang Yi pointed out that China is following a path of peaceful development.
The Chinese have never had the gene to expand abroad.
We believe that all countries can live side by side in harmony, exchange and learn from each other.
Whether in the past, now or in the future, China will neither follow the model of moving foreign countries nor ask other countries to copy China's practices.
When Wang Yi met with former US Secretary of State Kizinger in New York a little earlier, he said that the Sino-US cooperation would be a win-win, and the confrontation would inevitably be a double loss.
China has always been committed to developing long-term, healthy and stable Sino-US relations, achieving non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation.
On Tuesday, the China National New Office held a press conference to introduce and interpret the white paper "The facts and China's position on Sino-US economic and trade friction."

The latest news shows that the number of people killed has risen to 1,200, according to a report by foreign media on October 1 by CNN.com that the Indonesian island of Sulawii was hit by a powerful tsunami on September 28, causing serious damage to several cities along the coast.
According to reports, the town of Denggara, close to the earthquake, was hit by two rounds of tsunami. As the "golden 72 hours" of relief passed, the authorities believed that the number of people killed would continue to rise.
On September 30, 2018 local time, rescue workers carry an earthquake survivor rescued from under the ruins of a restaurant in Paru, Central Sulawezi Province, Indonesia.
Officials from the disaster relief department said the tsunami brought huge waves of up to 6 meters, and the impact of the earthquake and tsunami exceeded previous estimates.
It is understood that at the time of the earthquake and tsunami, hundreds of people were celebrating the festival on the beach in Palu, and many people were killed when huge waves swept away.
Officials say many buildings and infrastructure were destroyed when the tsunami hit the shore at an speed of 800 kilometers per hour.
He said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed, and the tsunami triggered mud and rock flows that cut off a major highway in Palu.
A bridge across a coastal river collapsed in Sulawezi.
On September 30, local time, Indonesian President Joko visited the city of Central Sulawisiparu, where the earthquake occurred.
Indonesian President Joko visited the disaster area on September 30 and said he had sent troops to help with the search and rescue, calling on the victims to be tolerant.
Zucko pointed out that the rescue operation was very difficult because of the shortage of heavy machinery and human hands.
He learned that many of the disaster areas lacked supplies such as water, food and fuel. In addition, many commercial households had closed down after the earthquake, and aircraft had been sent to send supplies by air.
He called on the victims to be tolerant and to stay in their original positions and wait for rescue.
Search and rescue workers in Palu said they heard a call for help coming from a collapsed hotel in the city, but some people needed help because there was no heavy machine to remove the shingles.
Indonesia's Vice President Kala said power and communications were cut off in some areas, leading to a lack of access to information, and that the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami could eventually rise to thousands.
According to the news of Shenyang on November 5 (reporter Xu Zhiqiang Correspondent Yan Yina), the reporter learned today from the meeting on the basic settlement of the implementation difficulties of the Lianning Provincial Court that during the six-month implementation of the "storm" campaign, the Lianning Provincial Court severely cracked down on the refusal to carry out the crime. A total of 241 persons were transferred and maintained the high pressure to crack down on the refusal to carry out the illegal crime.
It is understood that, according to the unified deployment of the Lianning High Court, from the beginning of April to the end of September, the Lianning Court launched a six-month campaign to basically solve the difficult "storm" of implementation, gather the superior forces and launch a comprehensive general attack on the difficulty of implementation of the basic settlement.
At the same time, the provincial courts have organized, in accordance with the law, "five batch" activities involving fines, detention of a batch, restriction of consumption of a batch, breach of trust and punishment of a group of persons, and transfer of a group of persons who refuse to commit a crime.
At the beginning of the activity, the provincial court had a total of more than 133.78 million outstanding cases. At the end of July, the case was closed to the bottom.
In the course of the activities, the provincial court imposed a total fine of 1,206.07 million yuan, detained 4,146 persons, restricted consumption of 162,844 persons, punished 55,128 persons for breach of trust, and transferred 241 persons for refusing to commit a crime.

"Where can I take a taxi, please?
We want to go to the Golden and Violet Square to see the flag raising ceremony of the national celebration! "
On the morning of October 1, the Song couple, who took a plane from Ning Xia to Shenzhen and transferred to Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Shenzhen High-speed Railway Guoqing Day, received a visit from the China News Service at the West Kowloon Station in Hong Kong, such as asking a reporter for information.
On the morning of October 1, to celebrate the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region held a flag raising ceremony at the Golden Violet Square.
According to the statistics of the immigration control points, as at September 30, the number of passengers entering Hong Kong via the High Rail West Kowloon Station had exceeded 300,000.
In time for the 69-year anniversary of the motherland, the West Kowloon Border Inspection Station is expected to see a peak of visitors to Hong Kong on October 1 and 2.
The reporter saw a large number of Mainland tourists at the Grand Hall in Hong Kong at 7 o'clock on the morning of the first day of the month. They took advantage of the Golden Week of Guoqing to take advantage of the high-speed railway and travel to Hong Kong.
Mrs. Song, who has a light foot, told reporters that the Guoqing holiday is a rare long holiday in the year, and that it has always been her wish to come to Hong Kong's Golden and Violet Square to see the flag raised. She felt particularly happy and excited to be able to achieve this wish on Guoqing Day.
At present, however, the flights to and from Hong Kong are not convenient. Fortunately, Mr. Song found that the first train will arrive at 7.3am after checking the train schedule of the Hong Kong section of the high-speed railway. The time is just right for the bus to take the bus from the city to the Golden and Purple Square.
He sighs to the reporter: "High iron is too convenient, fast and timely!"
The 70-hour short-distance trains to and from Guangzhou South, Shenzhen North and Futian and West Kowloon each day have greatly facilitated the arrival of residents in the Tai Wan area of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao.
After arriving in Hong Kong, Mr. Liu, who lives in Shenzhen, is preparing to visit his Hong Kong friends at the top of the Central Peak.
Mr. Liu said, "The Mainland of Guoqing Festival and Hong Kong are on holiday. We plan to challenge ourselves to see if we can finish the 50-km Hong Kong Island Trail!"
He explained that if it were not for the opening of the high-speed railway, convenient communication and sufficient time, they would not dare to easily try such a long distance of mountain activities.
Mrs. Yang, from Dongguan, came to Hong Kong for the piano competition with her 10-year-old son on a high-speed train. She proudly told reporters that her son, who had been studying for three years, found it meaningful to spend his time in this way.
She had been taking a bus in Hong Kong before, but it took time and effort. She was worried about affecting her son's condition. This time, she came via Shenzhen on a high-speed railway. She was more impressed by the convenience and half-time of the journey. She told reporters, "It's like taking the subway, especially fast. I've never been able to take a picture!"
On September 23, at 6: 44, the G5711 "Harmony" High Rail train set off from Shenzhen North Station and made a rapid journey. A few minutes later, the train entered the Hong Kong section of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong High Rail, the first officially operated high rail train in the Hong Kong section.
Integrated into the country's 25,000-km high-speed rail network, the Hong Kong section of the high-speed railway, which reaches 38 long-distance stations across the country, also welcomes Mainland tourists from different provinces in the north and south of the country.
Mr. Gao, who was visiting Hong Kong from Changshao on a short vacation, told reporters that before that, Gao Tiu could only take a ride to Shenzhen North, take the subway to Hong Kong and then transfer to the city for transportation. He was in trouble and time-consuming. Now, he was sitting directly in the middle of Kowloon. He felt very happy to be able to eat the lunch made by his children when he arrived at home.
He said that the convenience of the "one-place-two-inspection" process was beyond imagination. "In less than 10 minutes, both of them have passed."
The West Kowloon station, which is adjacent to the airport express and connected to land and air traffic, has also become the preferred destination for many passengers who have crossed the border.
Miss Wu, from Fujian, prepared to travel from Hong Kong to the Philippines for the Golden Week with her girls. She pushed her luggage as she left the gate in West Kowloon. She said to the reporter, "I was afraid of not being able to catch the plane. I didn't expect it to be so fast, but there was enough time!"
The new US-Mexico-Canada trade deal will retain US President Donald Trump's ability to implement the 25% tariff threat on imported vehicles, while essentially exempt passenger vehicles, pickup trucks and auto parts imported from Canada and Mexico from paying tariffs, according to a subsidiary arrangement to the trade deal announced on Monday.
If Trump were to impose so-called "Chapter 232" tariffs on cars for national security reasons, both Mexico and Canada would have a quota of 2.6 million tax-exempt passenger vehicles exported to the United States each year.
Under the subsidiary arrangement, pickup trucks produced in both countries will be fully exempted from customs duties.
If Trump were to impose an auto tariff, Mexico would receive an annual tax exemption of $108 billion for auto parts, and Canada would receive a $32.4 billion quota.
Both quotas are well above the current production levels of the two countries, providing room for growth in both countries' exports.
Washington, Sept 28 / Mexico - After days of debate, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and Canada are making real efforts to resolve trade policy differences, making it possible for the outside world to maintain the form of a three-way agreement with the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAAF), Mexico said on Friday.
Despite the lack of details, the apparent progress above is enough to prompt the Mexican and US governments to suddenly halt plans to release the text of the two-party trade agreement and give Canada more time to join the agreement.
Mexican President-designate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told reporters in Mexico that the U.S. government has made new counter-proposals to the Canadian government, saying he will continue to push for the participation of all three countries in NAAF.
Ildefonso Guajardo, Mexico's economy minister, said the submission of the text of the U.S.-Mexico trade agreement to Mexican and US legislation had been delayed because the Canadian and US governments had tried to reach an agreement "very seriously."
"In the next 48 hours, we will know whether we will reach a text of the three-way agreement or whether we will have to publish the text of the two-party agreement," Guajaldo said.
Guajaldo said his counterparts in the United States and Canada "specifically requested" that the release of the text be delayed.
A spokesman for the United States Trade Representative's Office (USTR) did not comment on the text of the U.S.-Mexico trade agreement and the US-Canada consultation.
Officials from the Office of the Prime Minister and the Office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Canada did not respond to requests for comment on the counter-proposal.
According to foreign media reports, in a conservation center on the outskirts of Pretoria, South Africa's capital, two young lions played with each other. It was hard to see anything unusual, but they were unique.
The University of Pretoria announced: "This is the first time in history that a baby lion has been born by artificial cultivation - the first pair in the world."
Scientists in the school are working to study the reproductive system of the lioness.
Ganswint, director of the Institute of Mammal Research at the University of Pretoria, said the two young lions, born on August 25, were quite healthy and normal.
After 18 months of intensive trials, his team finally made the breakthrough.
"We collect sperm from a healthy male lion," Ganswint said during a media interview.
Next, when the hormone content of the lioness reached an appropriate level, the researchers were able to give the lioness artificial training.
"Fortunately, the results were successful," Mr Ganswint said.
He said the researchers "tried several times, but surprisingly, they didn't take too much effort."
He said the aforementioned breakthrough could be repeated, and scientists hope to use the technology to rescue endangered large cats.
According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), lions have become the last species in 26 African countries, and the total number of wild lions that have survived has fallen by 43% in the past 20 years, leaving only about 20,000.
The lion is classified as a dangerous animal by this organization.
"If we don't do something for this animal, they're going to face extinction," Ganswint said.
He said the new technology did not have to allow lions to be raised, but simply injected sperm into a pregnant lioness, just as North America and Europe have done with captive elephants.
South Korean exports fell by the most in more than two years in September, but analysts attributed the decline to fewer working days and said global demand for South Korean goods remained strong despite rising trade tensions between China and the United States.
Indeed, South Korea saw an increase in exports on a daily basis last month.
In addition, preliminary data released earlier showed a double-digit increase in exports in the first few weeks of September before the long holiday.
South Korea's September export ratio fell by the largest since July 2016, more than the 5.7% decline predicted by the 11 analysts surveyed in the road-to-road survey.
The initial value released on Monday showed that exports amounted to US $50.6 billion in September, down from US $51.2 billion in August.
South Korea's exports to China rose 7.8% in September, expanding for the 23rd month in a row, despite a growing US-China trade dispute that could also hurt other export-dependent Chinese neighbors.
South Korean exports to the US fell by 11.8pc as sales of oil products fell.
Overseas sales of South Korean memory chips and petroleum products rose by 28.3% and 13.5%, respectively, despite concerns that the so-called "super-cycle" of chips may have reached its peak.
"However, the impact of the trade conflict will be hard to avoid, as South Korea's exports are heavily dependent on the US and Chinese markets."
Imports fell by 2.1% to US $40.8 billion, which is not as much as the 3.1% increase predicted by the road-to-road survey.
The trade surplus was initially valued at US $9.7 billion in September, up from US $6.9 billion in August.
The Ministry of Industry said that thanks to the United States and European Union countries, the global manufacturing industry will remain prosperous, which is a favorable factor for South Korean exports.
"Higher export prices due to higher oil prices will also benefit exports in the second half of this year," the statement said.
"But the continuation of the trade conflict between the US and China, coupled with increased market volatility following the US interest rate hike, is a negative pressure on exports."
Exports rose to an average of US $2.6 billion per working day in September, compared with US $2.1 billion in August.
South Korea's mid-autumn festival fell on September 24-26 this year, so there were only 19,033 working days in September, four days less than the same month last year.
South Korea's January-September exports rose 4.7% from the same period last year.
South Korean manufacturing activity picked up in September, according to the Nikkei / Marques purchasing managers' index, but was supported by domestic orders as orders from China and Japan fell, threatening to cast a shadow over the outlook for other exports.
North Korean media criticises US for not easing sanctions on North Korea
On September 30, North Korea's "Labor News" published an op-ed article in which it criticized the United States for not easing sanctions against the DPRK while seeking dialogue with the DPRK, calling it a "contradiction."
The article said that US Secretary of State Pompeo said on the 14th day that "in order to realize the humanization of the Korean peninsula, the key is to implement the sanctions against the DPRK," stressing that the position of the United States to continue to implement the UN sanctions resolution remains unchanged.
In the joint statement of the DPRK and the US in Singapore, the two sides pledged to establish a new DPRK-US relationship that is compatible with the aspirations of the two peoples of the DPRK and the United States for peace and prosperity.
It is undoubtedly a contradiction for the United States to press for dialogue while stepping up sanctions.
The article said that if we want to establish new relations between the DPRK and the US, build a permanently consolidated peace system on the Korean peninsula, and realize the complete humanization of the Korean peninsula, we should put the building of trust at the top of the list, starting with what can be done, and solve it in stages.
The article also said that the United States should understand that sanctions will not work for North Korea.
The article said that even the "North Dansk" before the "Kazan" made the US military sigh.
"We're going to have a strong potential opponent," the National Interest magazine quoted the US Navy as saying. "Just looking at the Nordansk submarine is enough."
Fugo, the current commander-in-chief of the US Navy in Europe, also has a reputation for the "North German Sk" submarine.
"The submarine is impressive, and a look at the development of the Russian Navy and how it uses its resources shows that its main effort in research and development is, first and foremost, to strengthen the submarine fleet," he said.
But National Interest magazine still believes that the United States maintains an advantage over Russia in this area.
"I believe that the West still has an asymmetric advantage," Fogo said.
Previously, it was reported that the Russian Navy will be equipped with the "Kazan" submarine in 2019.
The multi-purpose submarines Kazan, Kranoarsk, Krasnoarsk and Alhangersk are all modified for the "waxtree-M" model, with a discharge of 13,800 tons, a depth of 520 meters, a staff of 64, and a speed of 31 under-water flights. They will carry water mines, fish mines and "calibre" and "agate" patrol missiles.
According to the Beijing News (reporter Zhang Wei), on September 29, the General Administration of Radio and Television issued the "Notice on the Implementation of the Special Control of Radio and Television Ads," which will be carried out from the beginning of this month to the end of this year.
The contents of the renovation include advertisements on the issues of vulgarity, style and low grade, as well as medical and health programs that broadcast the problems without filing and management.
According to the notice, the focus of this special renovation work is to search for and rectify nine aspects.
These include: Advertising with guidance problems; advertising with poor content, bad style and low grade; advertising with excessive frequency and non-prescribed broadcast problems; medical, pharmaceutical, medical equipment, health food, cosmetics, beauty and other advertising issues such as exaggerated and false advertising, such as the issue of false advertising and the problem of false advertising, such as advertising and advertising, which are not subject to advertising.
The renovation work will be fully covered throughout the country, and the requirements of the regulation and regulation will be fully implemented to all levels of radio and television media, frequency of channels, program columns and time periods.

The notice requires that the administrative departments of radio and television at all levels deal with all types of illegal and illegal advertisements found during supervision and inspection in strict accordance with the General Administration's "Measures for the Handling of Violations by Broadcasting and Television Broadcasting Institutions."
If the violations are serious, they should be dealt with severely, such as talking with the public, criticizing the public, suspending the broadcast of advertisements and then suspending the broadcast of frequency channels, and publicly exposed to the public according to the circumstances.
In recent years, the General Administration of Radio and Television has repeatedly called for the suspension of illegal advertising.
This year, the State General Administration of Broadcasting and Television issued a notice to publicly stop advertising such serious violations as the "0 bubble fruit milk," "Shava chicken tail wine," "Bunritt plant anti-de-breeding hair dew," which has a guiding bias and exaggerated propaganda, misleading the audience, and so on.
The General Administration of Radio and Television has formulated a number of regulations and notices to regulate the conduct of broadcast advertising on radio and television.
The Notice on Further Strengthening the Administration of Advertising for Television Shopping Video on the Television Channel stipulates that TV TV channels shall not broadcast advertisements for TV shopping short films between 18: 00 and 24: 00 every day.
When advertising TV shopping short films at other times, the host shall not be used for publicity, or for propaganda purposes such as "voyeuristic" hyperbole, tone, movement, etc., or for publicity such as "manicure," "shape," "fat," "fat," etc., or for promotion of breast enhancement and weight loss products. The advertisement for TV shopping short films shall not exceed one (second) per hour per day, and shall not exceed 3 minutes.
The "Notice on Further Strengthening the Administration of Radio and Television Advertising" stipulates that TV stations must strictly abide by the provisions of the General Administration's Order No. 61 when interpolating advertising in the middle of video dramas: Two commercial advertisements may be placed in each episode of non-prime time (in 45 minutes), not more than one minute and 30 seconds at a time, and one commercial advertisement at a time (from 19: 00 to 21: 00) may be inserted in each cluster, and the advertisement should be in a minute.
The notice also stipulates that radio and television broadcast agencies shall strictly inspect the qualifications, certificates and other legal materials of health information advertising such as medical treatment, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, health care food, and firmly prohibit the broadcast of sex-related advertisements.
In order to regulate the form of health information advertising, it is forbidden to publish advertisements in the form of health information special programs.
Health information special programs shall focus on the introduction of scientific knowledge such as disease prevention, control and treatment. They shall not contain advertising content such as publicity of medical treatment, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, health food, etc., and shall not be certified in the name of patients, doctors, drugists, experts, etc.
"For the first time, we have made adjustments to the format of the MAAF International Aerospace Salon. We proposed that China should be the host country. Our Chinese counterparts agreed and accepted our invitation," Manturov said.
Not long ago, Chinese President Xi Jinping attended the 4th Eastern Economic Forum at the invitation of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
It was his first appearance at the forum.
Ignore the American threat!
EU may reach crude oil purchase deal with Iran
The US government recently announced that it will restart a new round of sanctions against Iran in November, and even urged other countries to reduce their imports of Iranian oil.
But America's allies don't seem to listen.
According to a report in the New York Times, on the 29th, Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif revealed that despite the threat of sanctions by the United States against any country that does business with Iran, Tehran is close to reaching an agreement with the European Union on the sale of crude oil.
The central purpose of the agreement is to try to establish a new payment mechanism, that is, to replace US dollar transactions in the form of bargains or local currency.
The aim of the method is to bypass the United States and prevent the United States from blocking financial transfers.
At the same time, while the EU is working to broker the deal, some French and British officials are also concerned that if the deal goes ahead, it will be the most open confrontation between the EU and the US, which is opposed to the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.
In an hour-long interview, Zarif's words sounded more optimistic than in recent months, according to the US media.
Because the agreement has the ability to "strip" America of its traditional allies and effectively break down US attempts to cut Iran's income.
"This will ensure that we sell oil and benefit from it," Zarif said, arguing that under the 2015 agreement, countries have a legitimate right to trade with Iran.
EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini also said recently that "no sovereign country or organization can accept other people to decide who they can trade with."
But she also predicted a series of financial measures by US leaders aimed at banks, businessmen and countries that have business dealings with Tehran, ahead of the next sanctions imposed by the US government in November.
In May this year, the US government unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal on the grounds that the agreement was flawed, saying it would not permanently ban Iran from producing nuclear fuel.
The United States then threatened to ban companies that buy Iranian oil and other goods from doing business in the United States.
The threat led to the withdrawal of some companies from Tehran and the collapse of the Iranian currency.
Companies such as Airbus and French oil giant Total have canceled billions of dollars in investment in Iraq.
British and French officials have said the US government could "have the upper hand."
Sure enough, according to a recent report in the Turkish media, the US sanctions do not appear to have had much impact on Iran's oil exports.
Iran's oil minister, Zanganeh, recently revealed that no other country other than South Korea has stopped buying Iranian oil.
Both Zarif and Iran's President Rouhani believe that a series of US actions are aimed at "luring" Iran into breaking the agreement.
Zarif was also unimpressed by a series of verbal attacks by the US, and even laughed when asked if the US would oust the current Iranian government under mounting financial pressure. "It is a strategy of a regime that is more repeated, and that is the real purpose of the US side."
"Revisit the Battery and Recall the Fanghua": The Opening Ceremony of the Cultural Tourism Market of the Houli Mountain Battery in Xiamen, China.
In that year, the first broadcast station of the front-line radio station to broadcast the common language in the south of the country, old man Chen Feifei, came to the Battery to recall and tell the history of the Battery.
The famous tourist scenic area and the Huli Mountain Battery Area, which is separated from the Jinmen River, was once the place where the People's Liberation Army of China set up a "front-line broadcast station."
On the 60th anniversary of the opening of the "Front Line Broadcasting Station," on the 30th day of the month, the King District held a "Revisit to the Battery to Recall Fanghua" event, inviting several historical witnesses of the former front-line broadcast station to discuss the historical changes of the Battery and witness the development and changes of the relations between the two countries.
The history witness of the front-line broadcast station told the history of the battery.
This is one of the activities of the second series of "Huli Mountain Battery Cultural Tourism Market Collection" which was built by Huli Mountain Scenic District.
Previously, the first event was successfully held here to create an exclusive cultural tourism brand that integrates cultural tourism IP, creative market collection and traditional folk culture experience.
On the same day, under the guidance of the Xiamen Travel and Development Commission, the Second Cultural Tourism Market Collection of the "Ancient Battery and the New Era" hosted by the Houli Mountain Battery District of Xiamen officially opened the curtain. During the 6-day event, the theme of the event will be "Fun Group" in the middle autumn and Guoqing, so that the people who come to visit the city can experience the thick and strong south wind in the "eat" of the "shopping."
The "Hear the Voice of the Sea" concert has become a big viewing point of the Battery Cultural Tourism Market.
Wang Yong, director of the Huli Mountain Battery Management Office, said that the "Retour of the Battery to Fanghua" event held to mark the 60th anniversary of the opening of the Huli Mountain Battery Front Broadcasting Station of the People's Liberation Army had invited a number of old Battery broadcasters to talk about the history of the Battery, so that people could remember the past years together.
In addition, the series of activities of the tourism market series also includes the 40-year anniversary of the reform and opening-up of the concert, the selection of old photos, and the public benefit exhibition of the large-scale single-body art installation of the "rabbit and little princess" on both sides of the sea in 2018.
Among them, the "Hear the Voice of the Sea" concert, as a major point of view of the Battery Cultural Tourism Market Collection, is an exclusive cultural brand activity created by the scenic district. It invited a group of girls from the Youth Palace of Xiamen City to join forces to sing a concert on the 40th anniversary of the reform and opening-up of the ancient Battery with the sea, showing the collision between the "Ancient Battery" and the "New Era."
The public interest exhibition of the large-scale single-body art installation of the "Rabbit Little Princess" on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, which was carried out during Guoqing, focused on creating an "eyeballs effect," attracting a large number of tourists and citizens to come and visit, join in the shadow, forward the circle of friends, and film the chime, so as to add a "net red" factor to the city.
On the other hand, an exhibition of winning works will be set up in the scenic area for the selection of the old photos. Through a photo with temperature, we will dig deep into the moments of happiness and emotion.

Reporters learned from the National Health and Health Council that compared with a few decades ago, the incidence of malnutrition among children and young people in China has decreased, while the incidence of overweight obesity has increased significantly.
In this regard, experts pointed out that maintaining a healthy weight, the most important concept is to "cure the disease," and vigorously promote scientific fitness and reasonable eating.
According to the "China Youth Health Education Core Information and Exposition (2018 Edition)," recently released by the National Health and Health Commission, the key to maintaining a healthy weight is rational eating and scientific exercise.
Being overweight, being obese and being blind to weight loss are all bad for health.
The health risks behind the "little fat piers" should not be ignored.
Ding Jianqiang, director of the Institute of Nutrition and Health of the China Centers for Disease Prevention and Prevention, said that overweight obesity is harmful to the normal growth and development of teenagers, and has a negative impact on their psychological, behavioral, cognitive and intellectual abilities. It can even lead to high blood pressure, high blood glucose and high blood fat in children.
At the same time, young people who are overweight and obese tend to continue into adulthood, which will increase their risk of developing chronic diseases such as high blood pressure and diabetes when they reach adulthood.
Ding Jianqiang said that in 2010-2012, the nutrition and health status tests of Chinese residents showed that China's 6-17-year-olds were 9.6% overweight and 6.4% obese, plus 16%.
At the same time, children and teenagers are more overweight than girls, and urban areas are higher than rural areas. The rate of overweight obesity has increased significantly in recent decades.
How do teenagers cope with overweight obesity?
Zhang Zhang, deputy director of the Scientific Fitness and Health Promotion Research Center of the State Administration of Sports, pointed out that the main reasons for youth obesity at present are excessive calorie intake and inadequate physical activity.
For this kind of simple obesity, we should pay attention to scientific exercise plus reasonable diet control.
Zhang Zhang pointed out that the most important concept for maintaining a healthy weight is to "cure the disease." An important part of this is to carry out all-round science and technology education for schools, parents and students, to spread the harm of overweight and obesity, and to raise the awareness of prevention among young people.
Teenagers should have regular medical checkups to monitor growth and development indicators such as high body weight, early detection and scientific determination of whether there is a problem of overweight and obesity, so that timely interventions can be taken.
For young people who are already overweight and obese, Ding Jianqiang recommends that, in addition to actively and scientifically arranging meals and exercise, teenagers are at a special physiological stage. They should avoid the use of hunger or semi-hunger therapy to control and reduce their weight, and should not blindly take weight-loss drugs.
September 28 - Facebook (FB.O) said on Friday that hackers stole digital landing codes, giving them access to nearly 50 million user numbers, which are unprecedented and represent the worst security breach in its history.
Facebook, which has more than 2.2 billion monthly users, said it has yet to determine whether the attacker abused any accounts or stole personal information.
The company also did not find the location of the hackers and was not sure if the hackers were targeting specific victims.
Its preliminary analysis revealed that this was a large-scale attack.
In a media conference call, CEO Zuckerberg called the incident "really serious."
A spokesman for the company said his account number, as well as that of operations chief Sheryl Sandberg, were also affected.
Facebook shares fell 2.6% on Friday, dragging down major Wall Street stocks.
U.S. lawmakers said on Friday that the attack could increase calls for data privacy legislation.
"This is yet another sad piece of evidence that Congress needs to take action to protect the privacy and security of social media users," Democratic Senator Mark Warner said in a statement.
'i hope to get an answer to the report on the security breach, 'Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Commissioner Rohit Chopra said in a tweet.

On such a special day, the families of the old soldiers who fought against the war in Hunan Province, the representatives of the members of the Communist Party of the People's Republic of China and the representatives of the old soldiers' home in Hunan Province, and other members of the society came to the theme park of the "Tang People's Wanshou Park," located in Changsha City, to attend the collective burial ceremony of the old soldiers who fought against the war in Hunan Province on the anniversary of 2018.
"The old soldiers who fight against war are witnesses of China's resistance to war. They are authentic, vivid and vivid teaching materials for the Chinese people."
Liu Xiao, the former vice president of the Huayuan Political Association, said that the spirit of love and self-sacrifice of the old soldiers in the fight against war is a valuable spiritual asset for the contemporary Chinese.
In his speech, Zhu Jianjun, vice chairman of the Changsha Municipal Political Association and the chief committee member of the Changsha Municipal Committee, pointed out that in recent years, the project of "caring for and fighting the war veterans" has become an excellent brand in the social service work of Changsha Municipal People's Revolution by providing care services for the war veterans in the form of living allowance, free old-age pension and free burial.
He believed that the spirit of resistance to war can only be passed on if history is etched in the heart.
At 11 o'clock in the morning, amid the solemn and heavy music, the people who came to the event stood in silence.
The members of the Tang people's protocol team, dressed in gowns, with flowers in their arms and with orderly steps, sent off 10 old soldiers and four old soldiers in a orderly procession.
The people who attended the event offered flowers and tributes to the old soldiers who fought against the war. There were also many children in the crowd, who joined their parents in paying tribute to the war hero.

Since 2015, there have been seven mass burial ceremonies for war-fighting veterans. There have been 102 war-fighting veterans and their partners sleeping here.
On October 1, China New Society Yichang (Guo Xiaoxiao Liu Min) newly amended "Three Gorge-Gezhouba Water-Lie hub traffic control protocol" (hereinafter referred to as "the dispatch protocol") officially began to be implemented on October 1. After two years of trial sailing, the Three Gorge lifter will officially be unified with the lock.
On the first day of the implementation of the new regulations, the traffic order in the waters of the Three Gorge-Gezhouba is good.
On September 30, at 21: 00, the Changjiang Three Gorge Transportation Authority issued the first safety inspection plan, and conducted security inspection on 160 ships. A total of 124 ships qualified for safety inspection.
On October 1, at 14: 00, the air traffic department arranged the first overpass plan after the implementation of the new regulations.
After the implementation of the new regulations, the security inspection plan will be issued once a day at 9: 00 and 21: 00, and the dam crossing plan will be issued once a day at 14: 00 and 20: 00, respectively. This will make it easier for ships to arrange the dam crossing plan in a flexible manner.
The "Dispatch Rules" have added the principle of "classification control" of the ship crossing the dam. According to the function positioning of the lock and lift, the priority of the ship passing the dam is clearly defined, and the short-term passenger ships passing the lock are adjusted to the same priority level as the demonstration ships and the integrity ships.
This is also the second anniversary of the pilot operation of the riser, officially and the lock of the unified scheduling.
And for the first time, the Chuan River and the Sanjigu District large-length and wide demonstration ships and new energy power ships have also been given priority status.
At the same time, the "traffic control and management waters" have been adjusted from 180 km of the previous near dam waters to 541.8 km of the Yunyang Changjiang Bridge to the Shi Tou Changjiang Bridge, and are divided into "core waters, near-dam waters, control waters, and dispatch waters."
This will help the ship to choose suitable waters to be locked, and reduce the backlog of ships to be locked in the dam area.
According to the characteristics of the current ship crossing dam and waiting gate, the "Movement Control Rules" also put forward such good faith restriction measures as cancellation declaration and 24-hour delay in crossing dam for ships in violation of the law.
After the storage of water in the Three Gorge, the shipping conditions in the reservoir area have been improved, and the rapid development of shipping in the Yangtze River has been promoted.
According to the data, the annual cargo passing volume of the Three Gorge lock and the Gezhouba lock increased from 34.3 million tonnes in 2004 to 138 million tonnes and 140 million tonnes in 2017, respectively.
In the past two years, the three-gorge lift aircraft has passed the ship 5767 times, had 162.2 million passengers and had a cargo volume of 17.128 million tons.
Chen Dongyuan, Deputy Director-General of the Three Gorge Transportation Authority, said that the "Movement Control Rules" have a positive effect on promoting the management of honest overpass gates, maintaining the order of the two dam hubs, removing the pressure of ships waiting for the gates in the dam area, and enhancing the ability of navigation.

After being signed and approved by Premier Li Keqiang, the State Council recently issued the Decision on Further Reduction of the Administration of Production License for Industrial Products and simplified approval procedures.
The Decision proposed that the list of industrial product production licenses should be further reduced, that the administration of production licenses for 14 categories of industrial products should be abolished, and that the authority for the administration of production licenses for 4 categories of industrial products should be transferred to the quality and technical supervision department of the people's government at the provincial level.
As a result of this reform, the number of products subject to industrial product production license management will be reduced from the 38 types of pressure last year to the current 24 categories.
The Decision clearly stipulates that the product in the catalogue shall be subject to a simplified approval process.
The first is to replace the pre-license product inspection organized by the licensing authority with the product inspection qualification report issued by the qualified inspection and testing institution by the enterprise at the time of application.
Second, in addition to dangerous chemicals, the quality and technical supervision department of the people's government at the provincial level (the market supervision and administration department) shall carry out post-site inspection of the products that have been licensed. After the enterprise has submitted the application and product inspection qualification report and made a promise to ensure the product quality and safety, it may obtain the production license after passing the formal examination and then accept the on-site inspection within the prescribed time.
Third, enterprises that produce and operate different categories of products in the catalogue shall, in accordance with the principle of "one enterprise, one license," review and issue a license certificate when applying for a new license or applying for a new license.
The Decision requires all regions and relevant departments to make solid progress in the work of reducing the catalogue and simplifying the approval process.
We will intensify the work of public disclosure and on-site review of enterprises' commitments, strengthen the means of credit supervision and restraint, implement the responsibilities of enterprises' quality subjects, and revoke production licenses for those who make false promises and do not meet the requirements.
For products that have been removed from the management of production licenses for industrial products, it is necessary to strengthen supervision after the event. Products involving public health and safety, environmental protection, etc., can be turned into compulsory certification. A positive list can be drawn up and disclosed to the public, and certification standards, reasonable reductions and certification testing items shall be unified. In principle, compulsory certification fees shall be borne by the financial authorities at all levels in accordance with the system.
Take support measures to encourage enterprises to carry out voluntary certification, promote the establishment of brands and expand the market.
It is necessary to meet the international advanced standards and promote the improvement of the quality of industrial products.
Give full play to the role of third-party social organizations to ensure the safety of industrial product quality.
For products that retain the management of production licenses for industrial products, it is necessary to improve the standard system, give full play to the advantages of industry supervision, strengthen the responsibility of "who approves and oversees," assess the risks of product quality and safety in a dynamic manner, reduce the catalogue in a timely manner, delegate the authority for examination and approval or convert them to certification management.
In September, the integrated PMI ring ratio of China lifted the PMI ring ratio of the manufacturing sector.
According to the data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on the 30th day of the month, China's comprehensive PMI output index stood at 54.1% in September, higher than the average of 0.3 and 0.1 percentage points in the previous month and year, indicating that the overall production and operation activities of Chinese enterprises remained stable.
In that month, the manufacturing production index and the non-manufacturing business activity index, which make up the integrated PMI output index, were 53.0% and 54.9%, respectively.
Among them, China's manufacturing PMI was 50.8%, down 0.5 percentage points from the ring ratio.
Zhao Qinghe said that this month's manufacturing PMI has five main characteristics:
First, the basic aspects of the manufacturing industry are generally stable.
Of the 21 industries surveyed, the PMI of 14 industries is in the expansion range. Among them, the PMI of pharmaceuticals, special equipment, electrical machinery and other manufacturing industries is at a higher operating level than 53.5%, with a relatively rapid growth rate.
Second, there are small fluctuations in supply and demand.
The production index and the new order index were 50.3% and 52.0%, respectively, down 0.3% and 0.2% from the previous month. The supply needs to continue to maintain a positive state, but the expansion slowed slightly.
The new export order index and the import index were 48.0% and 48.5%, respectively, down from 1.4% and 0.6 percentage points in the previous month.
Fourth, the cost of purchasing raw materials for enterprises has increased.
The price index for the purchase of major raw materials was 59.8%, up 1.1 percentage points from the previous month, and the factory price index was 54.3%, the same as the previous month, all of which was the highest in the year.
Fifth, the operation of large enterprises is sound, and the operation status of small enterprises continues to improve.
The PMI of large enterprises is 52.1%, which is the same as that of the previous month. Since this year, the index has been in the expansion range of 52.0% and above. This month, both the production index and the new order index have improved. This has been the main driving force behind the expansion of the manufacturing sector. The PMI of medium enterprises is 48.7%, down from 1.7 percentage points in the previous month, and is in the contraction range.
In that month, China's non-manufacturing business activity index stood at 54.9%, up 0.7 percentage points from the previous month, and picked up for two consecutive months.
Zhao Qinghe believes that the non-manufacturing industry as a whole continues to maintain a steady and positive development momentum.
The index of business activities in the road transport, securities, real estate and other industries has continued to be below the threshold, and the total volume of business has decreased.
November 5 - Kuroda Kuroda, president of the Bank of Japan, said on Monday that the central bank was aware that the long-term implementation of ultra-easy monetary policies could squeeze financial institutions' profit margins and potentially destabilize the country's banking system.
But he said that given low inflation and uncertainty in overseas economies, the Bank of Japan needs to maintain its massive stimulus program while keeping a close eye on the benefits and disadvantages of its policies.
"The Bank of Japan fully recognizes that under continued monetary easing, the strength of financial institutions will be increasingly affected," Mr. Kuroda said in a speech to business leaders.
He said that if financial institutions were more aggressive in taking on risks to compensate for the narrow profit margins caused by low interest rates over the years, there was a risk of instability in the banking system in the event of a serious negative shock.
"Although these risks are significant at the moment, the central bank will keep a close eye on the situation and encourage financial institutions to take the necessary measures," he said.
The minutes of the Bank of Japan's meeting, released earlier on Monday, showed that at its September meeting, the Bank of Japan's policy committee discussed the rising costs of long-term easing.
The minutes showed that one member said that if the economy continues to expand, "there will be more room for the Bank of Japan to be more flexible in terms of policy in the future."
According to the minutes of the meeting, another member said that the committee should discuss how long the Bank of Japan could sustain the stimulus policy, given the limitations of the policy during its duration.
Kuroda said the Bank of Japan will assess the financial risks posed by easing policies, while also taking into account the uncertainties surrounding Japan's economic outlook, which could affect global demand due to trade friction and rising protectionism between China and the United States.
"The impact of such problems on the Japanese economy is limited for the time being," Kuroda said.
"But how the problem continues, the impact on the Japanese economy is likely to get bigger," he added.
"There is a need for strong monetary easing on a continuous basis, while considering both positive and negative effects in a balanced manner," Kuroda said.
While the abuses of the aggressive stimulus program have increased, such as long-term low interest rates, which have eroded the profitability of financial institutions, low inflation has forced the Bank of Japan to maintain the program.
Japan's central bank maintained monetary policy last month; in the face of the risks posed by the global trade war, Kuroda ruled out raising interest rates in the near future.
Corporate logo on a Tesla electric vehicle, Cardiff, USA, June 1, 2018.
Under a settlement, U.S. Tesla Auto and its CEO, Michael Musk, have agreed to each pay a $20 million fine to financial regulators, and Musk will also step down as chairman of the company but remain CEO.
The settlement will mark two months of unrest for Tesla.
Investors will be relieved by the settlement of securities fraud allegations revealed by the Securities and Exchange Commission on Saturday.
Investors had feared that the long-running legal battle would only further hurt the still-loss-making electric car company.
The SEC sued Musk on Thursday for fraud, saying its August 7 tweet misled investors.
The tweet said he was considering privatising Tesla for $420 a share and had secured funding.
The SEC said the tweets were factually unfounded and that the market turmoil they triggered hurt investors.
Investors and corporate governance experts say the deal could strengthen Tesla, which has been hit hard by Musk's recent behavior.
Steven Binm, head of asset management at the University of California, said the settlement should have put Musk under more scrutiny, without taking "devastating" measures to oust him from Tesla.
The asset management company owns the shares of Tesla's battery maker Panasats.
Under the proposed deal, Tesla would have to appoint an independent chairman, two independent directors and a board of directors to develop controls over Musk's external communications.
"It is in the best interests of our market and our investors, including Tesla shareholders, to resolve this matter promptly and on agreed terms," SEC Chairman Clayton said in a statement.
Thursday's allegations resulted in a market capitalization of about $7 billion for Tesla, which stood at $45.2 billion on Friday, down from $47.5 billion for General Motors.
In the settlement, the SEC retracted its request to oust Musk from his position as the company's chief executive.
Many investors said the punishment would be disastrous.
"I think this is the best possible outcome for all the people involved," said Ivan Feinseth of Travel Financial Partners, who gave Tesla a "neutral" rating and said the SEC's punishment was "light punishment" for Musk.
"It's important for Tesla that he remains CEO."
Neither Musk nor Tesla acknowledged or denied the SEC's allegations in the settlement and did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The settlement agreement still needs to be approved by the court.
Beijing Morning News (reporter Wang Ping) The Beijing Morning News reporter recently learned from the Beijing Construction Industry Group that one of the core buildings of the Beijing World Park Park Park in 2019, the Beijing World Park Art Plaza Project, will adopt a multi-color ETF structure for the first time. The 5440 sqm membrane structure will present a deep red, dark green, orange, blue, red and green six colors.
According to Liu Changbo, the project director of the Beijing Construction and Construction Group, the construction area of the performance plaza project is 4500 square meters, with a total installed steel capacity of 1,182 tons. The steel structure roof is supported by a 26-meter umbrella-shaped steel frame, and the shape of the "butterfly wing" is displayed under the tentacles of the Lasso steel winch.
"From the sky to the performance plaza, the colorful roof is like a colorful butterfly with flowers, dancing and dancing, and the bright colors will not fade with the passage of time and the wind, frost, rain and snow."
Previously, the single-color ETT membrane structure has been widely used in bird's nest, waterside and other projects. However, the multi-color image ETF structure is still the first case in the country.
The reporter learned that because there are very few suppliers with a variety of color membrane structure production capacity worldwide, every inch of film structure material is very "valuable."
Liu Changbo said that in order to avoid problems such as overlapping and "fighting" in the position of the head of the rope, the "double-cross-ear" head structure will also be innovative to ensure that the head of the "fight" is held in the right place through a special fixed plug-in.
At present, the construction of the Beijing World Park Park in 2019 is under way.
Among them, the international museum project has completed the lifting construction of all "flower umbrellas."
It is planned that the project will be ready for exhibition by the end of October.

There are times when the wind is calm, there are times when there is wild wind and rain, "he said." Wild wind and rain can turn over small ponds, but not over the sea. "
After several wild storms, the sea is still there!
After more than 5,000 years of hardship and hardship, China is still there!
Facing the future, China will always be here! "

The death toll from Indonesia's powerful earthquake and tsunami has risen to 420. No Chinese citizens have been reported injured or injured
The death toll from the powerful earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia's central Sulawezi province has risen to 420, the official Antala news agency reported at midnight local time on August 29, citing figures released by the head of the country's disaster relief agency, Wilem Rammergilei.
According to the official, this is just statistics for the city of Palu, the capital of Central Sulawezi province, excluding Dungara County, where the earthquake occurred, and the nearby Sigi area, where communications are still suspended and no reports of fatalities have been received.
As many roads in Palu have been severely damaged and heavy machinery is difficult to access, search and rescue efforts have encountered great difficulties.
In order to guarantee the rescue, Paru Airport, which was closed on the 28th evening, was closed to all commercial flights after it was reopened on the 29th evening, and the reporter's flight from Jakarta to Paru was cancelled when the boarding pass was completed late in the evening.
In the wake of the earthquake and tsunami, the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia learned about and verified the situation of Chinese citizens in the disaster-stricken areas through the channels of the State Administration of Taxation.

"The hyperspace project is being carried out in accordance with the plan of the International Group and the contract signed with the Ministry of Industry and Trade," said Serparo, president of the Central Institute of Airflow Dynamics in Jokovsky, Russia.

The question for Russian scientists at present is how to balance the economy and safety of the aircraft, Serpalos said.
He said the ultra-loud aircraft is characterized by loud noise effects.
The institute is working with the Moscow Institute of Aviation and the Tupolev Design Bureau to develop a full range of civilian supersound aircraft, including business aircraft and large passenger aircraft for commercial transport, Sipalow said.
The general secretary of Xiu Yuping delivered a very important speech at the symposium of the National People's Congress, which injected confidence into the private economy as it moved toward a broader stage.
He stressed that "let entrepreneurs get rid of their ideas and move forward in a light way" has a strong resonance among entrepreneurs and innovative entrepreneurs.
The vitality of the market comes from people, especially entrepreneurs, and from entrepreneurship.
In the course of 40 years of vigorous reform and opening-up, there have been 10 million stories of entrepreneurship and innovation among entrepreneurs. The growth and growth of the entrepreneurial community has continued to push China's economy forward.
For some time now, some people in society have made a number of negative and suspicious comments about the private economy.
The so-called "private economy departure theory" "new public-private partnership theory" and other false claims have caused some entrepreneurs' doubts and concerns.
Recently, some civil society organizations have encountered many difficulties and problems in their management and development.
For example, changes in the international economic environment have had an impact on some export enterprises; rapid adjustment of the demand structure has led to pressure for transformation and upgrading; some policies have been inconsistent with each other, policy effects have been superimposed, or work methods have been simple, resulting in some policies that were intended to be good having the opposite effect, etc.
Various factors are interwoven, the private economy is in difficulty, some folk enterprises are confronted with difficulties, and entrepreneurs have shown a lot of anxiety.
In this context, it is of particular practical significance to correct the errors in understanding, remove entrepreneurs' ideas, and allow enterprises to plan for development with one heart and the government to promote development with one heart, which has a bearing on market confidence and development expectations.
At this symposium, the important argument of "the three have not changed" was again emphasized: "The status and role of the non-public economy in the economic and social development of our country have not changed!"
In recent years, the Central Committee of the Party has paid unprecedented attention to entrepreneurs and provided them with institutional protection, from deepening the promotion of the power of simple government and the establishment of a power list system to creating a legal environment that protects the legitimate rights and interests of entrepreneurs, creating a fair market environment and creating an atmosphere of respect for entrepreneurs in society as a whole.
The symposium also made clear the policy measures that strongly support the development and growth of the People's Democratic Republic of China in six aspects, and launched a series of pragmatic actions dedicated to the "light forward" of the People's Democratic Republic of China.
All these have given great encouragement to the entrepreneurial community and given more expectation to all sectors of society.
After the fog has been lifted, the policy has been set. The key is to implement it.
It is necessary to continuously create a better environment for the development of the private economy, help the people to solve the difficulties in development, and help realize the transformation and upgrading of China's economy. It is necessary to make entrepreneurs feel fair in market competition, feel safe in legitimate business operations, feel respect in social life, stimulate innovation vitality and create potential.
As China's economy enters the process of moving toward high-quality development, it needs more entrepreneurs to develop their ambitions, and it also provides more space and stage for entrepreneurs to develop their creativity.
We have reason to believe that with the further deepening of reform and the removal of obstacles, the private sector economy will usher in better development prospects and opportunities and move to a broader stage.
All 46 regulatory certificates in the import and export link of Inner Mongolia have been connected to the network verification - China-New Network
On November 5, the China-Singapore network Hohhot (reporter Li Aiping) Huhhot Customs reported that, with the exception of special circumstances such as the need for confidentiality, all 46 regulatory certificates of local import and export links have been verified online.
Inner Mongolia enterprises can declare relevant documents to the customs in a paper-free manner, avoiding problems such as on-site rush, paper application and repeated submission in the past.
It is understood that the preparation time of documents refers to the preparation time of the various types of documents required for the import and export link before the declaration is made, which is one of the main factors affecting the overall clearance time. In order to reduce the clearance time and reduce the transaction cost, it is necessary to reduce the document.
Previously, there were 86 types of supervision documents requiring customs verification at the import and export link, involving 19 departments.
It is reported that this time, in accordance with the principle of "cancellation can be cancelled, merger can be combined, exit port verification can be withdrawn from port verification," and relying on the "single window" platform of international trade, the customs and 16 other licensing agencies have been connected to each other in the system and data exchange, so as to achieve more data running routes and fewer business runs.
The customs said that in the past, enterprises had to go back and forth to the relevant departments to submit paper applications in the office hall. The process was long and it was unable to track the audit status in real time.
Now enterprise users can go directly to the "single window" portal and apply online.
After the examination and approval of the certification department, the e-data of the certificate will be transmitted to the customs, and the automatic comparison and smart verification of the customs data will be realized at the communication link. The audit results will be uniformly fed back to the enterprises through the "single window," and the entire process of monitoring the declaration, verification, inspection, access and feedback of the certificates will be handled online.
The export of Han Xuan chicken soup to China has increased by 20 times in 4 years or is related to the increase of the number of young people in the empty nest. - China New Network
Analysis of the 20-fold increase in the export of Han Xuan chicken soup to China in 4 years: Related to the increase in the number of young people in empty nest
South Korean chicken soup exported more than US $100,000 to China last year, a sharp increase of about 20 times compared with 2013 four years ago, according to a report by the Korean Associated Press on August 5.
According to the analysis, this increase is related to the increase in the number of young people in China's empty nest, which has led to the hot sale of convenient food, as well as the increase of young people's attention to nutritive meals.
The data was released by the Korea Agricultural and Aquatic Food Distribution Association (aT) on August 5.
Last year, South Korean chicken soup exports to China amounted to US $103.39 million, with a weight of 218.59 million kg, a sharp increase of 207.0% and 3668.8%, respectively, compared with 2013.
It is believed that the increase in sales of Korean chicken soup in China is related to the increase in the number of young people in empty nest, which has led to the hot sale of convenient food, as well as the increase of young people's attention to nutritive meals.
As of this year, one-person households in China have exceeded the 200 million mark, and are expected to increase to 30% of the total population by 2020. Local food enterprises have also launched various convenience foods aimed at the "sole eater."
In addition, the analysis also said that bird flu is the biggest factor preventing the chicken soup from taking root in the mainland Chinese market.
AT said that from November 2016 to April last year, there was an outbreak of bird flu in South Korea, and relevant authorities imposed a total ban on the export of chicken soup to China, resulting in a sharp reduction in the export volume.
In 2016, it exported US $840,000 to China, which fell to US $100,000 last year as a result of bird flu.

Individuals who have no residence in China but who have lived in China for more than one year and less than five years may pay personal income tax only on the part paid by units or individuals within China.
The part paid abroad shall not be subject to personal income tax within the territory of China.
The Ministry of Finance of China, the State Administration of Environmental Protection, the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Commerce also issued a notice to expand the scope of application of the pre-raised income tax policy for overseas investors to directly invest in the distribution of profits for the time being.
With regard to the profits distributed by overseas investors from residential enterprises within the territory of China, the scope of application of the domestic direct investment policy for which the advance income tax is temporarily not levied shall be extended from foreign investment incentive projects to all projects and fields that are not prohibited from foreign investment.
During the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, the parties released some positive messages on the Korean Peninsula issue.
South Korean President Wen Jinping echoed North Korea's "irreversible" determination to abandon nuclear weapons and said that US President Donald Trump and North Korea's supreme leader, Kim Jong-un, could meet before the end of this year.
The State Department later said that Secretary of State Pompeo will visit North Korea in October to promote the implementation of the commitment made by the leaders of the United States and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to meet in Singapore.
From the beginning of this year to the present, the two Koreas have broken the ice to open the path of dialogue, and the leaders of the two Koreas and the DPRK and the United States have met. The general trend of easing the situation on the peninsula has continued, and the principle of dialogue to resolve the peninsula issue has been upheld.
First, the point that "the essence of the peninsula issue is a security issue" has not changed. The key to achieving peace on the peninsula is to properly and in a balanced manner address the legitimate security concerns of all parties, rather than to pressure each other and emphasize their own claims.
Secondly, in the dialogue on the realization of the reunification of the peninsula, the parties concerned are still divided on the steps and ways to realize the reunification of the peninsula. Due to the long-term lack of political trust between the DPRK and the United States, the thinking of "who is first and who is later" is still strong.
At the recent open meeting of the Security Council on the Korean Peninsula held at United Nations Headquarters in New York, the different voices of the parties around the issue of sanctions against the DPRK once again highlighted the fact that these two points on the Korean Peninsula issue "have not changed."
U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo insisted that sanctions against North Korea will not be lifted until the Korean peninsula is fully neutralized.
On the other hand, Russian Foreign Minister Raffyrov stressed the principle of "responding to action with action," noting that "the weakening trend of sanctions should be the same as the steps taken by North Korea on the path of gradual abandonment of nuclear weapons."
There is no doubt that all parties concerned should continue to implement the Security Council resolutions on North Korea in a comprehensive, complete and accurate manner. However, pressure is not an end in itself. The implementation of sanctions and the promotion of a political settlement are both requirements of the Security Council resolutions.
As pointed out by Wang Yi, member of the National People's Congress and Minister for Foreign Affairs of China, in view of the current positive developments in the relations between the DPRK and the DPRK and the United States, China believes that it is necessary for the Security Council to consider the timely launching of the rebuttable clause, so as to encourage the DPRK and all parties concerned to take greater steps in the direction of humanization.
In the past, each and every step of progress in the Korean peninsula and the peace process has required sufficient political courage on the part of all parties.
At present, in the face of the increasingly high expectations of the international community to promote a political settlement of the peninsula issue, all parties concerned should, in particular, show political courage, make political decisions, implement their commitments, resolve difficult issues, and continue to take steps in the direction of each other, push forward the process of the reunification of the peninsula in parallel with the establishment of a peace mechanism on the peninsula, and jointly create a permanent peace on the peninsula.
On the first day of the month, the people's government of Jii County, Linyi City, Shanxi Province, reported that during the Guoqing Festival, the landscape area of Huanghe Guigou Waterfall, located in the county, will maintain a relatively high water level and will not meet the conditions for opening.
In order to ensure safety, the scenic area was temporarily closed during Guoqing Festival.
Huangheigou Waterfall is the second largest waterfalls in China and the largest yellow waterfalls in the world.
The Yellow River flows here, the stone walls on both sides of the river stand, and the river's mouth is narrow and narrow, forming the air outline of "one pot of the Yellow River in a thousand miles."
According to the reporter, from June to October of each year, it is the period of the Yellow River, and since July 12, 2018, due to the high water level of the Yellow River, the area of the Huanghe River, in the western part of the mountain, has been closed gradually. Therefore, it has been nearly a month since the closure of the Huangkou District.
Zhang Yufeng, chief engineer of the Yukou District Management Committee, told the media that this is the longest extension of the high water level of the Huanghe River in the past 20 years. "It has not been so long before. In 2017, the closing time of our flood season was four days, and this year it is nearly a month."
It is understood that in order to welcome the Golden Week of the "XI" in the Huanghe River Waterfall Area in the western part of the mountain, additional personnel arrangements as well as vehicle maintenance, and even the hiring of temporary staff, have been put in place.
According to the "Notice on doing well the flood prevention work of the Yellow River during the Guoqing Festival," which was sent by the "Huang River General Command Office for flood prevention and drought control," it is required to do well the flood prevention work of the Huanghe River during the national festival, namely, Qinghai, Gangshan, Ning Xia, Inner Mongolia, western Shaanxi, southern China and Shandong Province.
At present, there is a large flow of dry-flow channels in the Huanghe River. Upstream river flow is maintained at 2000-3,000 cubic meters per second, midstream river flow is maintained at 2500-3500 cubic meters per second, and downstream river flow is maintained at 3,000 cubic meters per second.
Health centres and health stations to provide high-speed vaccination services, particularly during Guoqing holidays.
This year, the Health Bureau ordered 150,000 doses of the four-price vaccine for 2018-2019. At this stage, priority is given to providing free vaccination to high-risk people. In order to make it easier for residents to get vaccinated during the holidays, the health centres and health stations of the Health Bureau provide vaccination services from 9 a.m. to 1 noon, especially during the Guoqing holiday (1 and 2 October).
In addition to the above measures, since the launch of the scheme, the health centres and health stations under the Health Bureau have extended the duration of the vaccination service to 8pm on Mondays to Fridays. As at 4pm on September 30, 4,158 people had been vaccinated, up from 3,714 in the same period last year.
Free vaccination is provided to the following Macao residents: Persons aged between 6 months and 18 years old, persons aged 50 years and over, pregnant women, all people with chronic diseases, including those who are obese (i.e., those with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or less), as well as staff in institutions, nurseries, nursery gardens, primary and secondary schools, all health workers, and Macao residents who work in Boxing recreation venues.
At the same time, other personnel, including the public sector, who the Health Bureau considers necessary for vaccination, will contact the relevant agencies on their own initiative to obtain the list and then arrange for the vaccination by the health centres.
In order to make it easier for people to be vaccinated and reduce the number of times they can be vaccinated, the Health Bureau will send medical staff to our secondary schools, primary schools, nursery gardens and nurseries between October and December this year to carry out collective vaccination for young children, small and medium-sized students, teachers and staff. In addition, the Health Bureau will arrange for staff to go to elderly and disabled homes, a large number of public sector or other institutions, etc.
Students and young children who have not been able to participate in the collective vaccination may be given a Macau resident ID card, a Health Bureau user card, a medical vaccination card (if any), a student card, an employee's card or a professional certificate to be vaccinated at a vaccination station or a health centre at the Earl of Yan General Hospital from December 3, 2018.
The Health Bureau reminded residents that during the period from September 2017 to August 2018, those who had been vaccinated from 2017 to 2018 will still need to be vaccinated for a new quarter of the vaccine from September 2018 onwards. As the flu resistance component of the northern hemisphere vaccine from 2018 to 2019 has been updated, it is targeted at the winter of 2018 to 2019 and the seasonal flu in the summer of 2019 in the northern hemisphere.
The peak period of flu in Macau generally occurs between January and March of each year. It is later than in the warm belt areas (such as northern China and Japan). The Health Bureau calls on the elderly, children, pregnant women, obese people and people with chronic diseases who are more likely to develop complications after contracting the flu, as well as those who are in regular contact with high-risk people, to be vaccinated as early as possible.

Tokyo, Oct 1 - Japan's central bank released a quarterly survey on Monday showing that the confidence of Japan's big manufacturers hit its lowest level in more than a year in the September quarter, as rising raw material costs and a series of natural disasters affected production, putting companies under pressure.
The survey shows little evidence that the escalating global trade friction has hurt the confidence of large manufacturers.
But the risk of a full-scale trade war has hit the business outlook of companies and could threaten their capital spending.
Active capital spending is a bright spot in Japan's economy.
The survey calls into question the Bank of Japan's view that robust economic expansion will help accelerate inflation to the 2% target, despite signs that companies are gradually shifting costs to customers.
"Amid the concerns raised by the global trade war, the confidence of manufacturers has stagnated as a result of slowing exports and weak factory production," said Nanwuji, chief researcher at the Institute of General Research in Nonglin.
"Confidence is still at a high level, and I don't think confidence will continue to decline because corporate profits are improving and prices are rising."
According to the short-term survey, in September, the index of large-scale manufacturing economy judgment fell from a positive 21 three months ago to a positive 19, which was the third consecutive quarter of deterioration.
The market's median estimate is positive 22.
For the first time in eight quarters, the index of large-scale non-manufacturing performance judgments fell to a positive 22 in September, down from a positive 24 in June.
The road-to-road survey was positive 22.
According to the survey, the index of large-scale manufacturing and non-manufacturing economy judgment remained stable in December.
Investors were unconcerned by the decline in the short-term corporate sentiment index. The Nikkei .N225 rose to a 27-year high on Monday, as the continued devaluation of the Nikkei helped improve the export earnings prospects of Japanese companies.
Capital spending is sound.
Despite the decline in corporate confidence, the latest short-term outlook shows that companies' capital spending plans are robust, thanks to renewed production capacity and increased investment in robots and automation to cope with the labor shortage caused by an aging population.
According to a short-term survey conducted by the Central Bank, large enterprises plan to increase capital spending by 133.3% in the current financial year ending in March 2019.
At the time of the previous short-term survey, 133.3%.
Nanwuji said that the capital spending plan of all enterprises in this financial year increased by 8.5%, which is close to the pace of the economic era in Japan.
"There is still room for further growth in capital spending in view of the higher profit forecast of small businesses from now on, but much depends on the impact of the trade war on business confidence," he said.
The short-term survey shows that companies have increased their ability to pass on costs, with the output price index of large enterprises at a positive 7, the highest level in a decade. This is an encouraging sign and reflects the progress made in Japan's efforts to combat the contraction.
The index, which measures the employment situation of large enterprises, touched minus 23, the hottest level since 1992, highlighting the tightening of the employment market.
Benefiting from strong corporate spending, Japan's economy rebounded in the second quarter from a contraction in January-March this year.
But the escalation of trade friction in the summer and the disruption of the supply chain by natural disasters have cast a shadow over Japan's export-dependent economic outlook.
In US dollar terms, the growth rate of import and export of services is 16.4%.

Oil prices or the welcome of the "three consecutive rises" of the country's self-driving travel can be filled with oil ahead of time.
At 24: 00pm on September 30, Beijing (reporter Qiu Yu), the new round of oil price adjustment window will be opened in parallel with Guoqing's long-term holiday.
A number of institutions forecast that the price of oil will rise significantly, achieving a "three-way rise."
Car owners who plan to drive on their own can fill their cars with oil before the price rises.
According to the data measured by the public information, it is estimated that the corresponding increase of domestic oil production will be about 190 yuan / ton, and that the increase in the calculation of the information of the company will be 220 yuan / ton.
In September, the price of oil has been raised twice: On September 3, the price of gasoline was raised by 180 yuan / ton and that of diesel by 170 yuan / ton. On September 17, the price of gasoline was raised by 145 yuan / ton and that of diesel by 145 yuan / ton.
Domestic oil prices are linked to international oil prices. Since this round of pricing cycle, international oil prices have risen in shock, and Blunt crude oil has continued to probe after breaking through the US $80 mark.
At the close of trading on September 28, U.S. WTI crude oil futures were up $1.13 at $73.25 / barrel.
Blunt crude oil futures closed up $1.0 at $82.72 a barrel.
"In the light of the international situation, tensions such as the sanctions imposed by the United States on Iran and the overall trend of oil prices have been strong. Subsequently, the OPEC production reduction meeting clearly refused to increase production, giving confidence to the market, and oil prices have steadily moved upward."
Zhang Wengang, an analyst at Zaoji Information Production Oil, said.
In terms of retail sales, at present, the number 92 and No. 95 of the China Petroleum and Sinopec gas stations in Beijing are 7.66 yuan / L and 8.15 yuan / L, respectively.
According to Li Hian, an information analyst at Long People, the preferential promotion strategy in the retail sector of gas stations has not changed much. At present, the preferential margin of the main stations such as Sinopec is 0.5-0.7 yuan / L, while the preferential margin of private gas stations is 0.5-1.2 yuan / L.
"The retail price of this round is about to rise" three consecutive times, "with the discount price rising by about US $0.14-0.16. Private car owners are advised to fill up the oil before the arrival of the long holiday in Guoqing," Li said.

Opening of the 99th International Aerospace Congress in Germany - Sino-New Network
Xinhua News Agency (Xinhua), Germany, on October 1, by telephone (Reporter Zhang Yirong), held the opening ceremony of the 99th International Aerospace Congress on October 1 at the Berlin Convention and Exhibition Center in Germany, attended by more than 6300 astronauts, representatives of space agencies and enterprises, experts, scholars and young students from all over the world.
In a speech delivered at the opening ceremony, the President of the International Aerospace Federation, Jean-Ife Legal, said that the global space industry is no longer limited to a small number of countries and institutions. This year, the number of participants has increased significantly compared with the previous one, indicating that more and more institutions and personalities are joining in the process.
He called on all countries to strengthen cooperation and innovation and jointly promote the development of the space industry.
Zhang Keyuan, Vice Minister of Industry and Information Technology of China and Director-General of the National Space Administration, introduced China's space program when he attended the exchange event and said that China will expand international cooperation in the space field and make contributions to the space industry of mankind.
Relevant institutions such as the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation and some representatives of civil society attended the meeting, displaying the latest achievements of China's aerospace industry, including various launch vehicles, satellites and aerospace science and technology application products.
The International Aerospace Congress, which has been held annually since 1950, is the largest event in the world aviation community.
The Congress, which will last five days, will be jointly hosted by the International Aerospace Federation, the International Academy of Aerospace Sciences, the Center for Applied Science and Technology and Microgravity Research of the University of Bremen and the International Academy of Space Law.
Beijing, November 5 - A press release issued by the China Foreign Trade Center on Sunday said that the meeting showed that the foreign trade situation in China is still complex and grim, with 80.6% of enterprises expecting that the export performance for the whole of 2018 will be better than that of the previous year or flat.
However, taking into account the external environment in which the cost of domestic raw materials, labor force and other comprehensive factors continue to rise and the impact of Sino-US trade friction has increased, the participating enterprises also believe that the export situation next year will be optimistic.
At the closing press conference of the 124th BCC, Xu Bing, Deputy Secretary-General, Press Spokesperson and Deputy Director of the China Foreign Trade Center, said that the number of overseas buyers and export transactions of the WTDC had decreased slightly in the same way.
At the current meeting, there were 189,812 buyers from 215 countries and regions, a decrease of 1.11% over the same period.
The export transaction amounted to RMB 206.994 billion (equivalent to US $29.86 billion), a decrease of 1% over the same period.
From the market perspective, transactions in Japan, the 10 ASEAN countries, the "Golden Brick Four" and the Republic of Korea increased by 74.4%, 11.4%, 7.2%, 2.5%, respectively, and fell by 30.3%, 8.9%, 7.3% and 0.8%, respectively, to traditional markets such as the United States, Australia, Canada and the European Union.
In terms of industry, transportation vehicles, machinery and equipment, construction and decoration materials, electronic consumer goods and information products, and bath equipment increased by 24.8%, 21.1%, 20.0%, 157.0%, and 7.6%, respectively, while textile clothing and household appliances decreased by 13.0% and 6.7% respectively.
Xu Bing said that as a rain gauge and wind vane for China's foreign trade, the participation of buyers and export transaction data of the current meeting showed that the development of China's foreign trade will still face many uncertain and uncertain factors in the coming year.
However, with the in-depth advancement of supply-side structural reform and the recent introduction of national and local policies and measures in the areas of "six stability," the new dynamic of China's foreign trade development is accelerating its accumulation, and new progress has been made in the diversification of the enterprise market. These are important foundations and powerful conditions for the development of foreign trade.
"Taking all factors into account, it is expected that the import and export of China's foreign trade will continue to grow steadily throughout the year, and the quality and benefits will be further enhanced," Xu said.
The General Administration of Customs of China announced that in September, the export ratio in US dollar terms increased by 14.5%, while the import ratio increased by 143.3%. In September, the trade surplus was US $3.169 billion. In September, both the export growth rate and the trade surplus were the highest since February this year.
Despite the escalating trade friction between China and the United States, China's export performance in September was still significantly higher than expected. The strong foreign demand, the depreciation of the exchange rate of the Chinese currency before the imposition of tariffs by enterprises in the United States, or the main supporting factors, also showed the resilience of China's foreign trade. However, the impact of the Sino-US trade war on confidence and on the industrial chain cannot be underestimated. Analysts believe that the challenges of China's foreign trade will be in the fourth quarter or next year.
According to the road survey, US fund managers recommended an increase in cash holdings in September and continued to be cautious as the United States and China began the latest round of mutual import tariffs, and the dispute showed no signs of easing.
But according to the 12 fund managers who participated in the survey, North America's asset allocation rose to its highest level since June 2017, while the UK and the euro area, particularly emerging markets, saw their positions fall.
Global equity allocation averaged 56.6%, while bonds accounted for 35.5%, largely in line with last month's survey.
The most significant change was the rise in the cash ratio to 5.1 per cent, the highest since December 2014.
"Some economic data has given confidence to the market, but the trade war is still the biggest concern, so it's better to be prepared to enter when the market falls back," said a fund manager at a large fund company.
But fund managers continued to favor stocks, particularly in the United States, in September, even if the price of U.S. stocks was deemed high.
Today, the China International Import Expo, the world's first major national-level exhibition with the theme of imports, officially opened in Shanghai, China's open land, amid the expectation of many people.
An exhibition is like a "window" that allows the world to better understand a city and a country.
Through the "window," people see a move toward a higher level of "open China," and with the help of the "window," welcome the world to win with the "reform and opening up again" of China.
"For a country, opening up is like breaking a cocoon into a butterfly. Although it will experience a moment of pain, it will be replaced by a new life."
In his summary of the road to openness, the general secretary of Xiaoping pointed out an important reason for "why China can."
Looking back on the 40 years of reform and opening-up, China, which has dared to enter the world market, has always faced all the risks and challenges with an open attitude, and has constantly unleashed its internal drive and continuously improved its competitiveness, despite having encountered high winds and winds and waves.
It can be said that China has effectively interpreted the value and significance of openness with its own tangible achievements.
Standing at a new historical starting point, the holding of the import-themed Expo is a major decision made by the CPC Central Committee, with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, to promote a new round of high-level opening-up. It is a major measure by China to actively open its markets to the world. It is a practical action by China to support economic globalization and trade liberalization. It has demonstrated the strong and clear will that "China's opening door will not be closed, but will only grow."
The largest affirmation and best response to China's development of an open economy on a larger scale, in a wider range of fields and at a deeper level is the registration of exhibitors from all over the world and the "one hard to find" of the exhibition booth.
More importantly, the current global economic and trade order has reached a crossroads.
Some countries have built a high wall of trade protectionism and returned to the old path of unipartialism, which has increased the concern of the international community about the prospect of free trade and added a lot of uncertainty to the recovering world economy.
Against the backdrop of this era, the event on the side of the Huangpu River embodies China's defense of free trade, allowing the world to see China's confidence in opening its markets and sharing the future and China's responsibility.
One way, one way, one way, and one way.
By opening up its heart and embracing the world, China has not only vigorously promoted its own development, but also brought endless "opportunities for China" to all countries and regions of the world.
In recent years, China has advocated and promoted the joint construction of the "Belt and Road," initiated the creation of the AIIB and set up the Silk Road Fund.... China has provided a series of international public goods, provided real export markets, development opportunities and jobs, and allowed enterprises from all over the world to ride in China to develop the "express car."
It is also such a public product and a large platform for global trade and economic cooperation.
On top of this platform, more than 3,000 enterprises from more than 130 countries and regions have taken a new step in the Chinese market with their unique products and services.
In addition to national enterprises, domestic consumers are the real beneficiaries.
By setting up this platform of "excellent selection and improvement," it has provided a multi-channel high-quality supply for consumption upgrading, and met the needs of the people for personalized, diversified and differentiated consumption.
As China opens its doors more and more open, goods flow freely, goods are used, and the pace toward a better life will be more solid.
From a broader perspective, the significance of the CPC has gone beyond the scope of economy and trade. Rather, it is to focus on the future, convey the concept of openness, inclusion, mutual benefit, balance and win-win, and form a common understanding to jointly address today's challenges.
If the world is good, China is good; if China is good, the world is better.
We look forward to a wonderful and successful future for the world. We are more committed to a higher level of "open China" and the world to work together to build a brilliant future for the community of mankind's destiny.
Foreign media: The United States and Canada have reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
[Abstract] The agreement includes Canada opening up its dairy market to the United States, as well as the suspension of tariffs imposed by the United States on Canadian-made vehicles.
According to foreign media reports, a Canadian source revealed on the evening of September 30 local time that the United States and Canada had reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
It was revealed that the agreement included Canada opening up its dairy market to the United States, as well as the suspension of tariffs imposed by the United States on Canadian-made vehicles.
On August 27 last year, the United States and Mexico announced a preliminary agreement to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement, but the United States and Canada failed to reach an agreement before the August 31 deadline set by the United States to extend the talks until September 30.
Previously, a spokesman for Canadian Foreign Minister Francois Frieland said Canada would only sign a favorable agreement, "with a focus on substance rather than a timetable. We will continue our consultations in the hope of reaching an agreement that is in Canada's national interest."
More than 90% of Brazilian women voters said the presidential candidates did not take women's needs into account.
Data released recently by the Brazilian National Geographic Institute (IBGE) showed that more than 90% of Brazilian women do not believe that presidential candidates take women's needs into account, according to the South American Overseas Press Network.
According to the report, the number of women in Brazil has reached 107 million, and if women from all over Brazil are brought together to form a country, the country's population will be ranked 13th in the world, more than twice that of Spain as a whole.
In Brazil, women account for 52 per cent of the total electorate and men for 48 per cent. Although women account for a very high proportion of the electorate, in Brazil, women account for only 10 per cent of the total number of voters in the National Congress.
Of the world's 193 countries, Brazilian women are ranked 154th in politics, higher than those in the Arab world.
After more than 20 years of struggle for rights, Brazilian women have still not succeeded in obtaining the rights they deserve.
Natalia Mori, a Brazilian sociologist, pointed out that the reason for this phenomenon is the combination of ancient patrician society, racism and capitalist values.
"Politics is supposed to be made up of citizens claiming civil rights, identity, access to public goods, and a society made up of multiple social groups, but Brazilian politics is a monopoly of one group and the majority of the population is not represented."
According to a previous study conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Locommerva, 33.3% of Brazilian women do not feel that elected politicians can represent their rights, 90% of Brazilian women do not agree with the decisions made by politicians, and 93% do not agree with the current government's governance policies.
"We need to reverse the under-representation of women in parliament, and Brazil's political system is still affected by inequalities. So far, there are still serious gender, class and racial discrimination in Brazilian politics," Nataliya Mori said.
Despite the lack of women's rights, most Brazilian women still believe in the power of democracy.
According to the survey, 76% of women think they can make a difference in democratic elections, while 72% of women are interested in politics.
In addition, 55% of women believe that democratic politics is the best way to expose women to less prejudice.
On October 1, the Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan held a solemn ceremony to raise the national flag to welcome the 69-year-old Huaxuan of New China.
All the staff of the Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan, news agencies based in Kazakhstan, financial institutions, Chinese enterprises, Chinese overseas Chinese, Kongzi College and representatives of foreign students attended the event.
On October 1, the Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan held a ceremony to raise the national flag to welcome the 69-year-old Hua Yu of New China.
After the flag-raising ceremony, Zhang Yu, the Chinese ambassador to Kazakhstan, said that on the occasion of the 69th birthday of Wei Da's motherland, we held a national flag-raising ceremony in a foreign country. It was a profound educational activity of love and love.
Although you have been living overseas for a long time, you are always in the heart of the great motherland.
Zhang Yu said that the Chinese nation is closer to achieving the great goal of national renewal today than ever before, and closer to the center of the world stage than ever before.
"Our mission, responsibilities and work are more glorious, arduous and onerous than ever before."
Zhang Xuan stressed that we should not forget our initial thoughts, bear in mind our mission, push China and Kazakhstan to build a "Belt and Road" in a stable and profound way, draw a more beautiful "Road and Road" "painting," and devote all our strength to the development and construction of the motherland and the friendly cooperation between China and Kazakhstan.
The T2 terminal of Guilin Shuanjiang International Airport in Guangxi officially opened on the 30th.
Zhao Le Qin, the secretary of the CPC Guilin Municipal Party, said that the new terminal can meet the demand of 12 million passengers per year after its opening, and build a new advantage of Guilin air traffic. It is of great significance to further improve the modern three-dimensional traffic pattern of the "four-place integration" between the river and the sea, the sea and the railway, the water and the land, and the air ports.
This year, Guilin is expected to receive more than 90 million visitors.
The expansion of the T2 terminal of Guilin Shuanjiang International Airport and its supporting facilities is a major public welfare project for the 60th anniversary of the founding of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, as well as a landmark project for the construction of Guilin International Tourism Resort.
The project was launched in December 2015, with a construction area of 100,000 square meters and a total investment of 3.258 billion yuan. After its completion, the project will meet the annual demand of 12 million passengers, 10.12 million flights and 95,000 tons of goods.
On the same day, more than 200 flights began to fall at the T2 terminal of Guilin Shuanjiang International Airport.
The design of the new terminal is inspired by the world of Guilin Mountain Water. It looks like a "mountain water laurel crown". It is similar to the "dragon ridge terraces" and the layered eaves of the people's homes in the north of Gui. It is a cross-section with the water of Guilin Mountain.
According to the report, the new terminal of Guilin Airport can meet the peak flow of nearly 4,000 people per hour in and out of the port. It has used the "smart airport" technology such as smart baggage sorting system, security integration platform, face recognition, etc., and has planned commercial areas covering a variety of industries such as dining, shopping, duty-free and recreation.
As growth in Europe, Asia and emerging markets has mostly been unencouraging, the United States has increasingly become a major engine of global economic growth.
On September 23, 2018, a container cargo ship was moored in a port in the United States state of California.
But as the current growth in the United States benefits from the timing of the fiscal stimulus of tax cuts, the country's economy has also come under close scrutiny.
"As the United States is returning to full employment, it is inevitable that there will be a downturn in the economy."
The only question, he said, was when it would happen, which, in his view, would probably only happen sooner rather than later.
While Barclay is optimistic about the outlook for the US economy by the end of this year, the bank acknowledged that it is more difficult to make forecasts for a longer time.
"In the absence of more sustainable investment growth to boost the growth potential of the economy, current growth driven by fiscal policy will be difficult to follow," Barclay economists said in a research note.
"At a time of lack of investment growth, the risk of a hard landing for the economy in 2020 will rise," they said.
A series of business surveys will generally show that the major economies are in the economic cycle phase at the end of the third quarter.
The euro zone and US manufacturing surveys, due to be released next Monday, will come under scrutiny, and the services sector survey will be released on Wednesday.
But next week's data will inevitably focus on US non-farm employment data, due to be released next Friday, which will provide clues as to whether the tight job market is driving a big rise in wages.
Its importance is not only because of its importance to the profitability of companies and the purchasing power of consumers, but also because of the rise in wages or the rise in overall inflation that could unsettle officials of the US Federal Reserve Commission (Fed / FED).
"Pay is going to get a lot of attention because it could go up significantly again from the previous month," he said.
The September rise may not exceed 3% year-on-year, but we can fully expect a breakthrough next month, "ING economists wrote in a research note.
The political situation in Europe could become a source of market volatility at a time when China and the rest of Asia are on holiday, causing the region's data to fade next week.
The Italian government has ignored previous financial commitments to the EU, and the rest of the EU will have to quickly determine whether it is firmly opposed to the Italian decision. The Italian government does not support the decision, and he wants to abide by EU rules.
As Brexit talks enter a crucial phase, the annual meeting of the British Conservatives in Burmingham is likely to be a spark.
Meanwhile, concerns surrounding emerging markets are unlikely to fade as Brazil holds its much-anticipated presidential election next weekend.
[Abstract] After the ship is completed, it will be delivered to the Donghai Branch of the State Administration of Ocean Affairs of China for use. Chen Yu, head of the observation department of the Marine Early Warning and Monitoring Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China, said that the vessel will be of great significance for the development of China's offshore ocean observation system and the promotion of global ocean observation.
On September 29, China's first 3,000-ton large-scale buoy ship, the "Yuyang Hong 22," went under the water at the Chinese martial ship group.
When the ship is built, it will break the current bottleneck of China's equipment in the work of large-scale buoy, submarine laying, recycling, emergency repair, and so on.
The "Yangyang Red 22" wheel is mainly used for the regular observation and maintenance, regular laying and recycling, emergency laying, recycling and emergency repair of the buoy / submarine, and at the same time has the capability to carry out integrated ocean survey tasks, such as cut-off survey.
The new ship is 89 meters in length, 18 meters in width, 7.2 meters in depth and 10,000 nautical miles in duration.
Wang Hunling, deputy general manager of Wulong Group, said: "The Yuyang Hong 22 is the first large-scale buoy operating vessel in China and the only working vessel in China with the ability to lift a 10-meter large-scale buoy, which will further enhance the security capability of China's large-scale buoy."
It is understood that the ship will be delivered for use by the Donghai Branch of the State Maritime Administration of China when it is completed. Chen Yu, head of the observation department of the Marine Early Warning and Monitoring Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China, said that the vessel will be of great significance for the development of China's offshore ocean observation system and the promotion of global ocean observation.
"At the same time, the ship is equipped with large-scale buoy laying and maintenance operations. At the same time, it also has a comprehensive marine survey capability. It is the first integrated ship in China to be used exclusively for the operation of medium and far-sea buoys and the integrated survey of the ocean.
With such a buoy operation ship, our ocean observation and ocean survey will have powerful benefits in the future. "
On October 1, Qingdao, China's new network, was affected by the impact of the sound of the typhoon "Lake Mae," and the first race day of the 2018 International Limited Sailing Series at Qingdao Station, which was scheduled to begin on September 30, was postponed to October 1. A pre-race meeting was held at Qingdao Ofu Center before the race. The captain of the 12 water-wing two-body sailing teams from six countries and regions was in full swing.
Under the influence of the sound of the typhoon, the strong wind in the Hong Kong pool continued, with the maximum wind speed even up to 24 sections. The signal was delayed by nearly 90 minutes from 1 pm on the 30th, and the wind speed was still not reduced. The general referee of the event, Anne Mundrante, announced the cancellation of the first day of the game and postponed the game to the afternoon of October 1.
"The strong wind from the shore continues, and the sea conditions are just too intense."
"In this case, no one knows when the gusts will wind towards the boat," Mundrante explained.
Close to the city's racecourse, in terms of the current wind conditions, it is the most sensible choice to cancel. "
There is still a bit of disappointment for the crew who are ready to go.
"The boat is ready to stop and we're in good shape."
"But I know the change is the right thing to do, and I hope the wind is smaller today, so we can make a difference," Qingdao's helmsman, Maks Richardson, admitted.
Omica Wilkinson, known as the "Star of Hope" of the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games, said: "The loss of a day has instead made the game more interesting.
Because the weight of today's game will increase, and there are only two days left to play.
Everyone is going to be particularly desperate. "
Despite the strong sea wind, the French ABM's helmsman, Pierre Ives Durand, complained at a pre-match meeting about his warm past with Qingdao, where the competition was held: Five years ago, he suffered an accidental injury, a broken muscle, and the handling of the local sports medical team allowed him to stand on the field today, five years later.
It is reported that the International Limited Sailing Series was founded in 2007 and is known as the World Wings League with Wolvo, Jaguar Cup, World Sailing Tour and other events.
The Qingdao station competition will feature a "flying ghost" water wing double-body sail.
The year 2018 is the eighth year for the event to land in Qingdao, the "sailing capital," and Qingdao Station is also the closing battle of the series.
Despite the continued turmoil in global financial markets, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said on Monday that the investment income of the Exchange Fund in the third quarter of this year fell by 33.3% year-on-year, but was better than the performance of the previous quarter, as overseas stocks rose in the wake of the Sino-US trade war and foreign exchange losses narrowed significantly.
According to the latest data of the HKMA, the exchange fund recorded investment income of HK $1.6 billion in July-September 2018, which is significantly lower than the HK $61.8 billion recorded in the same period last year, but better than the revised HK $100 million recorded in the second quarter of this year.
At the beginning of the Sino-US trade war, Hong Kong and emerging market stock indexes ran counter to the US stock index. Until the peak of the US stock market index at the end of September and the beginning of October, market sentiment began to reverse as investors gradually realized that the trade war was also bad for the United States itself, said the president of the HKMA, Chen Dehui, in the Legislative Council.
"A change in market sentiment is a good thing, and if a trade war has only one-sided influence, it will do little to help solve the problem."
But he also pointed out that "if the Sino-US trade war is not resolved, financial market volatility will continue to rise."
In the third quarter of this year, the stock investment losses of the Exchange Fund in Hong Kong narrowed by 8% to HK $4.7 billion compared with the previous quarter, while overseas equity investment earnings increased by 17.2% to HK $12.8 billion. Foreign exchange losses of HK $16.2 billion and bond earnings of HK $9.7 billion decreased by 24% and 31%, respectively, reflecting the general rise of the US dollar against major currencies in the quarter and the rise of US interest rates by 3% in the month.
The Exchange Fund is primarily used to support the Hong Kong dollar.
Since 1983, Hong Kong has implemented a linked exchange rate system between the Hong Kong dollar and the United States dollar.
In response to the current financial situation in Hong Kong, Mr Chan said that the economic and asset market uncertainty had increased and the risk of going down had increased. However, the financial system in Hong Kong was sound and defensive, and there was plenty of earthquake resistance.
"Hong Kong is rich in international investment, with a net foreign asset value of US $1.4 trillion equivalent to four times GDP, which is 2.5 times higher than that of Singapore and 0.6 times that of Japan. It is sufficient to cope with the next cycle or reversal of the economy."
Recently, the interest rate of the Hong Kong dollar has continued to fall and expanded with the US dollar. Mr Chan pointed out that the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar rose by more than 400 basis points on September 21. The market is generally believed to be mainly related to the rise of the Hong Kong dollar interest rate. Since then, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar has hovered around 7.80-7.84. The recent decline in interest rate of the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar interest rate of the US dollar is likely to increase.
But he believes that with the start of the interest-raising cycle for Hong Kong banks and the normalization of Hong Kong dollar interest rates, the situation of Hong Kong dollar interest rates below the US dollar rate will change in the future.
"The Hong Kong dollar interest rate will be more in line with the US dollar interest rate trend. We must be more careful in managing risks, and be prepared to deal with market fluctuations."
Due to the abundance of funds in the Hong Kong dollar, the Hong Kong dollar interest rate fell further. The three-month interest rate fell by 0.9% to 2.08179% on Monday. The spread with the US dollar increased from 46 basis points to 51 basis points, while the interest rate with the US dollar increased from 120 basis points to 127 basis points.
From May to mid-September, the current Hong Kong dollar exchange rate was close to 7.85 to US $1 for most of the time.
During the period, the weak party exchange guarantee was triggered several times in May and August after it was triggered for the first time in April, due to factors such as the withdrawal of some of the funds from the Hong Kong dollar after the closing of the interest-bearing activities and the large-scale IPO activities.
In accordance with the linked exchange rate system, the HKMA purchased Hong Kong dollar at the level of 7.85 and released the US dollar in order to maintain the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.
In May and August, the HKMA bought a total of about HK $52.1 billion under the weak party exchange guarantee mechanism.
Is there any preferential treatment for people outside the country in the new tax law?
In response to a question on the 30th, the relevant heads of the Ministry of Finance and the General Administration of Civil Aviation said that, in order to maintain policy stability, the next step in the implementation of the new personal income tax law will be to consider continuing to make preferential arrangements for people from overseas, including those from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
A reporter asked that the newly amended personal income tax law will adjust the assessment standard of individual income tax residents in China from one year to 183 days.
May I ask if there are any preferential arrangements for overseas people, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, in the next step of implementing the law?
In response, the person in charge said that the current regulations on the implementation of the personal income tax law have special preferential provisions on the tax payment of people outside China. Individuals who have no residence in China but who have lived in China for more than one year and less than five years may pay personal income tax only on the part paid by units or individuals within China.
The person in charge said that, in order to maintain policy stability, the next step in implementing the new personal income tax law will be to consider continuing to make preferential arrangements for people from overseas, including those from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
There is no "threshold" of the lunar center: Quality certification promotes quality improvement.
With the pull of the "two-child economy" and the prosperity of the mother-and-child market, from the north to the three-and-four-line cities, a variety of monthly clubs have emerged from all over the country.
At present, the hot monthly meeting has met the consumer demand of the masses, with fees ranging from tens of thousands of yuan to several hundred thousand yuan, but at the same time it is in an embarrassing situation. So far, this institution has no threshold, and there is still a blank area for supervision.
The State General Administration of Market Supervision recently launched a national "Quality Month" series of activities in 2018. Reporters came to a five-star monthly sub-center in Tianjin City to visit the experience of certification of mother and child care services.
The general lunar center provides services such as newborn care, nutritive meals, post-natal repair and plastic shape.
At this month's child center, the reporter saw that the nurse checks the nursing condition of the newborn every day, and the professional nurse provides the delicate care services such as bath and touch for the newborn.
At the same time, in order to meet the needs of new mothers, from the care of wounds in the early stage of the moon, to the services of beauty care in the middle and late stages of the moon, to provide medical care programs such as Chinese medicine treatment and beauty, to help mothers recover their appearance.
A new mother who was living in the house told reporters that she had booked into the lunar club eight months in advance.
The services of the lunar clubs have a direct impact on the comfort level and physical recovery of the mothers during the month-to-month period. Some small-scale monthly clubs can only provide some simple lunar services. There are hidden dangers such as non-standard sanitizing hygiene, easy cross-infection, single unscientific diet and so on.
The head of the lunar sub-center said that they were the only one of all five-star sub-centers in Tianjin city to be certified as a B-level service.
"Although some customers did not understand the meaning of B-level certification at first, it is important for the long-term development of enterprises to benefit from the strict standardized process management of enterprises through certification," he said.
Pan Liifen, deputy director of the certification and accounting department of the State General Administration of Market Supervision, said that service certification is a new type of certification system based on customer perception, concern about the quality management of the organization and satisfaction of service characteristics. It is an important component of the national quality infrastructure and plays a positive role in raising the proportion of the supply of quality services and enhancing the international competitiveness of China's services.
China started in 2004, and after more than 10 years of development, the service certification project has undergone a process of gradual development, with the emergence of a number of influential service certification such as financial services certification, mother and child care service certification, commodity after-sales service certification, e-commerce service certification, health service certification, and so on.
According to the statistics of the State General Administration of Market Supervision, at present, there are more than 130 service certification agencies in China, with more than 2,000 service certification personnel, and nearly 8,000 valid certification certificates.
Pan Liifen said that it is necessary to further guide and promote the development of service certification, gradually expand the coverage of service certification in the fields of health, education, sports, finance and e-commerce, and help promote supply side reform and quality improvement in the service sector.
Hong Kong, November 5 - Hong Kong property prices have fallen for two consecutive months after the peak. On Monday, Hong Kong Monetary Authority President Chen Dehui said that it would take time for fashion to observe whether the property market has entered the next cycle. If confirmed, consideration could be given to easing the tightening policy of counter-cyclical measures in due course.
Mr Chan also pointed out that if property prices were to return, those who would be the first to be affected would be those who bought property at the height of the market. However, a sharp fall in property prices, such as during the 1997 financial storm in Asia, and a much lower chance for the public to sell property at significantly reduced prices would be expected.
Speaking at the briefing of the Legislative Council, Mr Chan said that if it was confirmed that the housing market was entering a downward cycle, measures could be relaxed in due course.
"At present, however, only a few weeks of data have been seen. It is still too early to relax. It will still take more time to see if the market is entering the next cycle."
Since October 2009, the HKMA has introduced eight rounds of counter-cyclical measures to significantly tighten mortgages for all types of properties, including reducing the number of mortgages and requiring mortgage applicants to pass rigorous stress tests to enhance bank risk management and shock resistance.
With Hong Kong officially entering the interest-raising cycle, the index of private residential property prices in Hong Kong reached its peak for two consecutive months from August to September, and the monthly decline in September was further extended to 1.44%.
But the cumulative rise in the first three quarters of this year is still 10.2%.
According to the data of the HKMA, the financial position of households facing financial risks in Hong Kong is still healthy. In the second quarter of this year, the proportion of households living in self-housing without mortgages in Hong Kong reached 66%, which is higher than the average of 60% in 2009-11. The average number of mortgages issued and the ratio of supply to interest on new mortgages was 47% and 34%, respectively. This is a marked improvement over the 2009-11% and 41% respectively.
However, Mr Chan said that the high earthquake resistance does not mean that people who have bought a property will not be harmed by the economic downturn, as property valuation will fall, and those who buy a property at the peak will be the first to do so.
Although the HKMA has tightened banks' lending to mortgage lenders, home buyers can also obtain a high number of mortgage loans through mortgage insurance or mortgage loans provided by developers.
Mr Chan said that at present, together with the mortgage loans provided to developers, the number of mortgages of borrowers can reach 85-90%. If the property price falls by 10%, there will be negative assets (i.e. the market value of the property falls below the total amount of outstanding mortgages).
However, Nguyen Guofeng, vice president of the HKMA, pointed out that the authorities estimated that the total number of mortgages provided by developers was high, accounting for only 2-2.5% of total bank mortgages, and that the proportion was still low.
At the height of Hong Kong's negative assets in 2003, the number of negative assets exceeded 100,000, accounting for 22% of the total number of people who provided housing.
As of the third quarter of this year, Hong Kong recorded zero negative assets for the seventh consecutive quarter.
Xinhua News Agency Beijing, October 1 (Liu Hongxia, Ma Yu) e-commerce retail export enterprises welcomed another wave of tax benefits on October 1, involving value added tax, consumption tax exemption and other aspects.
The Ministry of Finance, the State Administration of Environmental Protection, the Ministry of Commerce and the General Administration of Customs have recently issued a joint letter making it clear that, for the export of goods that have not obtained valid import certificates for e-commerce export enterprises in the comprehensive test area of cross-border e-commerce, if the following conditions are met, the policies of value added tax and consumption tax exemption shall be tried on a trial basis.

Second, the export goods shall be subject to the electronic commerce export declaration procedures through the customs at the place where the comprehensive test area is located.
Thirdly, the export goods do not belong to the goods for which the Ministry of Finance and the General Administration of Civil Aviation have expressly abolished the export refund (exemption) tax in accordance with the decision of the State Council.
The notice made it clear that the General Administration of Customs regularly transmitted electronic information on the declaration list of e-commerce export commodities to the State Administration of Environmental Protection.
The tax authorities of each comprehensive trial area shall strengthen the tax-free administration of export goods in accordance with the electronic information of the export goods declaration list compiled by the State Administration of Environmental Protection.
The notice pointed out that the specific measures for the administration of tax exemption shall be formulated by the provincial tax department, the finance department and the commercial department.

On November 5, a man in Lianning Province killed his lover and left him dead. He fled to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region after a dispute over the distribution of money and income.
On the 5th, the reporter learned from the Dongsheng District Public Security Bureau of Ordos City, Inner Mongolia, that the man was successfully arrested after a joint investigation by the police of the two places.
On June 26, 2018, a woman disappeared in Anshan City, Lianning Province. Family members reported the disappearance to the local police.
After investigation and investigation by the police, it was found that this was not a simple case of missing persons. The missing person is likely to be killed by his lover Wang. The police immediately set up a special investigation team to carry out further investigation.
On October 30, the special investigation team found that the suspect Wang may have gone to Dongsheng District, Ordos City, and the Dongsheng police should have organized the police force to fully cooperate with the police in the investigation of the case in Lianning.
After five days of investigation, the police finally found out the landing point of Wang, and made a detailed study of the relationship between him and his relatives.
On November 4, the police of both places worked together to capture the criminal suspect Wang Mou in an excavator accessories store in Dongsheng District.
According to Wang, he was in a relationship with a lover of the victim, and because her sister had a large sum of money temporarily deposited in her name, they decided to take the money as their own.
On June 22, 2018, due to differences between Wang and Bai over the ownership of the fund, Wang went on to kill Bai in the rental house, breaking down the body and throwing it away.
At present, the criminal suspect Wang Mou has been handed over to the police in Anshan, Lianning.
On-line operation of the "Green Development in Action" theme train of the "Five Good Development and Security Emblem"
The second theme train - "Green Development in Action" - was officially put into operation on the fifth day of the month.
In order to fully showcase the brilliant achievements made in the construction of the "Five Good Development Emblem," Hefei Track Company and Jinping Media and Technology Company jointly designed and produced the "Five Great Development and Good Security Emblem" series of theme trains.
Among them, the first train, the "Innovative Development in Action" theme train, was officially put into operation on October 1 on Line 1 of the Hefei Railway Road Traffic Line.
The theme train on the upper line chose the main color of blue and green, which is a symbol of mountain water. It embodies vitality, vitality and purity.
The publicity content highlights the core idea of the "Five Good Development Emblem" as well as 18 representative cases of green development achievements in the province, including the construction and development of key green development projects such as the Yangtze River Canal Project, the Lin Chang System, the protection and development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt, and the 10 million-acre Forest Growth Project.
In addition, the three theme trains, "Coordinating Development in Action," "Open Development in Action," and "Sharing Development in Action," will also be on the line in the near future.
On the first day of the "Golden Week" in the Mainland, and the last day of the public holiday in Hong Kong, many Mainland residents took advantage of the holidays to travel and shop, and many Hong Kong residents came back to Hong Kong on the same day. There was a "blast shelter" at the Shenzhen ports, and 22 new self-service channels were opened at the Luohu and Shenzhen Bay ports to enhance the efficiency of the new self-service ports.
According to the data provided by the Shenzhen Border Inspection Station, as of 16 p.m. that day, the number of people entering and leaving Shenzhen Port reached more than 429,000, and the number of transport tools reached more than 168,000 times. All ports have been busy and have maintained a good order of entry and exit.
It is understood that as a result of a number of positive factors, such as the increase in the number of countries providing exit visa exemption policies for Chinese citizens, the number of tourists taking advantage of the Guoqing holiday to travel to Europe and Southeast Asia and other countries for holiday shopping has continued to increase.
On the morning of January 1, the exit direction of the ports of Luohu, Shenzhen Bay, Honggang and Futian welcomed the peak of passenger (vehicle) flow. Among them, the peak of passenger flow at Luohu Port continued from 9: 00 a.m. to 11: 00 a.m., and the peak of passenger (vehicle) flow at Shenzhen Bay Port from 6: 30 a.m. to 13: 00 noon.
According to the report, in order to deal with the peak flow of passengers (vehicles) entering and leaving the country, the Shenzhen Border Inspection General Station shall, in accordance with the unified deployment of the National Immigration Administration, activate the service mode of the passenger (vehicle) flow peak hour, arrange overtime police to support the line of duty, open sufficient inspection channels in advance, guide passengers and vehicles to wait for inspection in an orderly manner, ensure that the entry and exit of Chinese citizens is not more than 30.
At the same time, the Shenzhen Border Inspection Station reminded passengers entering and leaving the country that they should pay attention to the validity period of their certificates, visas and endorsements before traveling, arrange their trips in a reasonable manner, avoid rush hour of passenger flow, and choose the right time and appropriate port to travel.
Passengers who travel to Hong Kong on the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong High Rail are required to hold valid entry and exit certificates and visa endorsements. The high-speed rail ticket is only a passenger ticket. It cannot be used as an entry and exit certificate. If they cannot leave the country for Hong Kong for reasons such as non-compliance with the registration procedures, they should follow the guidelines of the police on border inspection duty and wait at a designated location for the passenger to be brought back to the Mainland.
Systemic lupus lupus is a chronic disease with multiple organs throughout the body. In the past, it was considered to be an "incurable disease."
Because the mechanism of the disease is unclear, the diagnosis and treatment are difficult, and there is no effective treatment method, so it cannot be treated.
Recently, Liu Wanli, a researcher at the School of Life Sciences of Qinghua University, and a joint team of the Director of the Wet Immune Immune Center of the People's Hospital of Beijing University found that human immune globulin has a molecular variation that increases the sensitivity of systemic lupus lupus, and this variation is involved in the regulation of immune B cells.
In short, the two teams confirmed that an abnormal immune molecule in the human body is an important cause of the onset of systemic lupus lupus.
According to Sun Xiaolin, one of the authors of the article and a member of the Beijing People's Hospital, the team collected and conducted research on nearly 2,000 cases of systemic lupus lupus in large samples. It was found that the patients with immune globulin variation produced a wide variety of disease cells and a large number of self-antibodies, and the incidence and severity of inflammation such as kidney, arthritis, servitis and vasculitis increased significantly.
Liu Wanli's team found that the immune signal through immune cell tracking, animal tests, sequence detection and other research methods can promote the disease-causing mechanism of B cells to secrete a variety of self-antibodies.
The reporter learned that the two teams are strong and united, giving full play to their respective strengths, and achieving a close combination of basic research and clinical application.
The Liu Wanli team is committed to the study of B-lymphatic immune recognition and immune activation, while the Chonzhuo team has long been engaged in the clinical study of systemic lupus lupus.
"This study is one of the results of many years of cooperation between the two teams. It is also the first time that the academic community has recognized the mechanism that immune globulin gene abnormal will induce systemic lupus lupus, which has laid a solid foundation for further academic research and clinical targeted treatment."
This is not to protect the short, but to act in accordance with the law.
Did the lawyer bring his head to the court for a hearing?
The news was really exciting at first glance, and it blew up the pot in the legal circle.
Fujian Quanzhou Central Law subsequently fined the lawyers involved 500 yuan and advised the Quanzhou Bar Association in writing to investigate and deal with the matter.
According to the Beijing News, the Quanzhouzhou Law Association recently issued an official notice stating that the two lawyers' actions did not involve violations of the law and were not punished according to law.
According to many reports, the treatment of Quanzhou Law Association is not to protect the short or to engage in confrontation, but to get the approval of Quanzhou Central Court.
An incident that could have triggered tensions within the legal community was finally properly resolved.
The reversal of the matter stems from a more complete restoration of the truth: The murder weapon carried by the lawyer involved is of the same style and model as that of the defendant, but it has not been opened. It is only used as supporting evidence at the evidence-proof stage, and there is no subjective intention to intimidate or "endanger the security of the court."
There are four very important details in judging whether the actions of the lawyers involved are illegal or not. Firstly, the local court has held two previous sessions and only produced a photograph of the head of the court. From the point of view of the defense, it is necessary to show the original object of the head of the court. Secondly, it is not the lawyer who did not want to seek the consent of the judge, but has objectively failed to contact the judge.
Taken together, it can be seen that the lawyer involved has nothing to do with "bringing an axe to court," but only for the purpose of defending.
After the whole fact passed in the Qing Dynasty, the Quanzhou Law Association did not push the boat according to the water, but took up the pressure and made the decision not to punish.
And this decision is also worthy of the test of fact and law.
As for bringing the head of the control tool to the court without the permission of the court, it is indeed easy to cause disquiet and misunderstanding.
For reasons of safety and caution, the previous fines and judicial advice of the Quanzhou Central Court are not to be denied.
In order to safeguard the dignity of lawyers and prevent individual courts from trying to trouble lawyers, the Supreme Law issued the "Rules for Judicial Police Security Inspection of the People's Court" in 2014, which established the principle that lawyers do not need to conduct physical security checks when they appear before the court.
Since the issuance of the rule, lawyers have acted on their own terms, and there have been very few incidents that have endangered the security of the court because of the security breach.
In rare cases such as Quanzhou, as long as communication is conducted in a spirit of mutual respect and understanding, it is not difficult to eliminate misunderstandings.
As a self-discipline organization of the legal profession, the bar association has the dual mission of punishing illegal behavior and safeguarding legitimacy.
In the past, individual legal association organizations have suffered from serious problems due to their bias over discipline, and their failure to protect them.
And the decision of the Quanzhou Law Association, both in terms of process and outcome, is commendable, setting an example for more legal associations to perform their duties correctly.
From October 1, which tax benefits will affect our money bags?
Xinhua News Agency Shanghai, October 1 (reporter Sanghu) The new personal income tax law will come into effect on January 1, 2019. In order to enable the masses of the people to enjoy the tax relief dividend at an early date, the actual income from wages and salaries earned by taxpayers will first be deducted at the starting point of RMB 5,000 per month from October 1, and a new tax rate scale will be applied.
With the fall of the new government, what are the benefits that will affect the money bags of the masses?
Benefit 1: The amount of tax relief on wages and salaries is obvious.
Taxpayers who receive wages and salaries after October 1 may deduct the basic deduction of RMB 5,000 per month and apply the new tariff scale. Most taxpayers have different degrees of tax relief, especially for the middle and low-income earners.
According to the tax reduction tables of different income groups, the monthly income tax allowance of RMB 8000, RMB 10,000, RMB 20000 and RMB 50,000 after the deduction of the "three risks one money" is RMB 90, RMB 290, RMB 1590 and RMB 9090 respectively. Compared with the monthly threshold of RMB 3500, the corresponding tax reduction ratio is 73.9%, 61.1%, 49.0% and 187.0%, respectively.
It is worth noting that, as a result of the holiday, the wages that should have been paid in October by various units in accordance with the law at the end of September may be subject to the new basic reduction of fees and tax rates.
To this end, the withholding client software, which has been uniformly promoted by the tax department, has provided the corresponding tax calculation function, but the corresponding tax still needs to be reported and paid within the statutory filing period.
Benefit 2: The low tax rate is significantly larger than the level of the tax.
In addition to raising the threshold, a new tax scale will apply from October 1.
The seven-tier tax rates on wages and salaries have remained the same as before, but there has been a marked change in the tax scale. The three-tier low tax rates of 3%, 10% and 20% have been significantly expanded, while the 25% tax scale has been reduced, while the three-tier higher tax rates of 30%, 35% and 45% have remained unchanged.
It is worth noting that the tax law has also adjusted the tax rates for all categories of income from production and operation, with the lower limit of the highest 35% tax rate being raised from 100,000 yuan to 500,000 yuan.
This means that both individual businesses and sole ownership partnerships will benefit from the tax reform.
"Judging from the calculation of individual tax cuts for Shanghai taxpayers in the early period, the vast majority of taxpayers will fully feel the dividend of the tax reform, especially for the low and middle income groups."
Lanmin, head of the personal income tax department of the Shanghai Municipal Tax Administration of the State Administration of Environmental Protection, said.
Benefit 3: More convenient and optimized tax services
Since the publication of the new personal income tax law, the tax department of Shanghai has carried out a series of comprehensive and extensive tax publicity actions.
On the one hand, to the key tax sources and key enterprises to carry out "one-to-one, point-to-point" policy guidance.
The Pudong New District Tax Bureau has visited Apple Trading (Shanghai) Co. Ltd., Alipay (China) Network Technology Co., Ltd., Red Star Mekilong Home Group Co., Ltd. and other large enterprises. These enterprises have a large number of employees, a large amount of withholding work, a large amount of tax payment, and the tax department has taken the initiative to coach and answer questions. The Xuhui District Tax Bureau has visited the large-scale labor industry, China-based Finance, China, China, China, and Shanghai, and Shanghai, and Shanghai, and Shanghai.
On the other hand, to the general public taxpayers, carry out "all-around, multi-dimensional and integrated" tax policy push.
To ensure that the policy publicity is in place, the Shanghai Tax Administration website, the WeChat public number and the Weibo channel are used to push the policy hot spots in a timely manner.
At the same time, on September 28, the Shanghai Tax WeChat Public Line 12366 smart advisory platform launched the "targeted" smart integrated tax reform publicity service through the "artificial + smart" tax service consultation.
On the evening of November 5, Beijing time, the England Football Association officially announced that the former England captain, Ronny, will return to the England team to play in the warm-up match against the United States on November 15.
In August last year, Ronny announced his withdrawal from the England squad.
Ronny has previously made 119 appearances for Inglan, scoring 53 goals, and is the team's first shot in history, with the number of appearances ranked second in history.
According to the FA's website, the game with the US team was to raise money for Ronny's children's charity, and he was thrilled: "It was a great pleasure to play for England in Wimbley again, thanks to Southgate and the FA for inviting me to help my foundation.
Playing for England is the greatest glory of my career, the 120th and will be my last for England, and it will be a special memory for me, "he said.
On the 30th day of the annual Yangcheng Lake Crab Cultural Tourism Festival, the curtain was opened. According to the party secretary of the "Town of Yangcheng Lake Great Crab," Valley Wenhua, the annual economic output value of the town's Dacheng Crab is close to 3.8 billion yuan, with a net income of more than 600 million yuan.
Yangcheng Lake is also known as the Golden Cage Crab, which has a reputation as the "Crab King" because it does not have mud on its body. It is commonly known as the Qingshui Crab, with its green shell and white belly, and its meaty paste.
It has become a well-established practice for people to go on a diet in the golden autumn of Dangui.
Bacheng Crab is the most well-known image agent in the city of Bacheng.
Peeling the crab shell, peeling the foot of the crab, picking the crab meat, diving the crab material, diners feel the beauty of being in the south of the river.
This year, more diners will spend more time in the city, watching the egrets catch food and enjoy the fun of catching the crab and enjoying the slow-paced life of the water country on the edge of the Yangcheng Lake in Yanbo, according to the Crab Nong Jinwei.
Due to the widespread introduction of large-scale seedlings in Pakistan towns and cities, this year, the head of the large-scale crab is much larger than in the past.
Ganghua, a crab farmer who has been dealing with Dacheng Crab for nearly 20 years, is planning to export the crab seedlings and breeding technology of Yangchenghu Crab to Thailand, so as to allow the water township cuisine to reach the national boundaries and promote cultural exchanges with overseas cuisine.
"Kunjuo Town" is a cultural attraction in the city of Baba.
At present, Bacheng has built the Crab Garden, Fisherman's Light Fire, Spring and Autumn Water City, Linghu Crab City, Zhengyi Baliu Crab Market, five major crab markets and fine food streets. There are as many as 1,300 large and small restaurants around the Yangcheng Lake Great Crab for dining business. The different colors of the Crab are not easy to see. At the peak of the passenger flow, the traffic is a unique scenic line.
"A Crab" brings in nearly 3 million tourists in and out of the sea each year. It also forms a two-way, two-sided and lively old Bacheng street.
There are a number of tourism products such as the Kunji theme post office, the collection concept book bar, the Pink Baby theme image museum, the Kunji theme folk residence, the Sage Embroider Museum, and the Bumble Hall. A number of famous studios, such as the Kunji scholar Yang Leongsong, the master of the pike, the famous Kunji Xiaolin, the master of bamboo craft, and the folk song inheritance, have entered into the city of the city of the city of Kun.
It is reported that, during the Crab Cultural Tourism Festival, the 4th Kunchou Town, Jiyang Festival will also be opened again, and the friends from all over the world will gather together to gather for the celebration of the Yushan Festival.
A number of cultural venues will also be unveiled, including the Bacheng History and Culture Exhibition Center, Kunji Long Gallery, Akiya Court, Chongwen College and Kunping Opera Grand Theater, which will present the cultural charm of Kunjuyuan Town, China's book-and-art town, and the Yuangnam Water Town in the south of the country.
A three-way trade deal between the United States and Mexico will open up new opportunities for 500 million people.
According to foreign media reports, a joint statement by Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland and US Trade Representative Lighthizer published on the website of the Canadian government said that the United States, Canada and Mexico had reached a three-way trade agreement, which would be known as the "USMCA" (the US-Mexico Three-Nation Agreement).
Earlier, Canadian television station CTV News quoted senior US sources as saying that Canada and the United States had resolved their differences and reached an agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NATA).
The September 30 agreement between the United States and Canada will retain the North American Free Trade Agreement as a three-way trade agreement, and the heads of the three countries will sign a new agreement within two months, the Washington Post reported, citing two sources familiar with the situation.
"Today, Canada, the United States and Mexico have agreed on a new trade agreement, the USMA, which will provide our workers, farmers and companies with a high standard of trade agreement that will lead to a more free market, more fair trading and more sustainable economic growth. The agreement will strengthen the middle class, create high-wage jobs and create new opportunities for some 500 million people," the statement said.
It is understood that the current North American Free Trade Agreement was signed by the United States, Mexico and Canada in 1994.
After Trump took office, he announced that he plans to review the agreement and sign a new one.
The three countries began the negotiation process in 2017.
In the early hours of the morning of the 1st local time, the results of the early election for the director-general of the military, who died of his illness, were announced. Yucheng Dani, who opposed the relocation plan of the US military base in Japan, was successfully elected.
The final results of the vote, which was conducted on September 30, showed that Yucheng won a total of 3.96.32 million votes, creating the largest number of votes in the history of the election of the governor of the county of Shuangcao, with more than 80,000 votes more than its main rival, Zaoxi.
A total of four candidates participated in the election, with a vote rate of 63.24%, down 0.89 percentage points from the 2014 election of the county governor.
Yucheng 1 told the media that the results of the election showed that the people of the county did not want to let Mr. Weng's efforts before he was born. He will inherit his legacy and continue to work with the Japanese government and the US government on the opposition to the relocation plan of the US military base and the closure of the Universal Air Base, among other things.
The Japanese government had previously agreed to relocate the US military base in Yiongwan, Okinawa County, to the border area of the famous city, but the people strongly opposed it and hoped to move the base out of the line completely.
However, with regard to the relocation plan strongly opposed by the county residents and the requirement to withdraw the permission to fill the sea and make land along the coast of the border, Yucheng said that he did not stand in opposition and division with the central government in the first place, and hoped that the two sides would fully exchange views and show their intention to resolve the issue through consultation.
On the morning of August 1, the Prime Minister of Japan, Anjongjin, also told the media that he sincerely accepted the result and would make efforts to revitalize the line and reduce the burden on the base.
At a press conference on the 1st, Japan's Chief Secretary of State, Nao Yiwei, said there had been no change in the government's policy on moving the US military base as soon as possible.
At the same time, he also expressed his intention to hold talks with Yucheng.
Yucheng will officially take office on the 4th of this month.
Since the mid-2000s, as China's demand for oilseed has grown, Paul Thomas, a farmer in North Dakota, has grown more and more soya beans in his fields.
The shift reached its peak this year, when he planted 1,600 acres of soybean on 5,000 acres of land on a scale never seen before.
But Thomas and many farmers like him plan to turn to corn and wheat, the staple crops of the former American agricultural region, in 2019.
American farmers have grown more soybean than corn this year, for the first time in 35 years.
The plan to switch to other food crops stems from the difficulties faced by American farmers in selling soya beans in the context of US President Donald Trump's trade war against China.
China usually buys about 60% of US soybean exports, but in recent months, the price of soybean has fallen to a decade low as a result of the trade war, which has resulted in almost zero US soybean purchases.
Thomas plans to grow more wheat next year, hoping to make more money by reducing his dependence on crops that depend on Chinese demand.
Thomas said the price of big beans "hit us hard."
He said that without the Chinese purchase, the price of soybean in the vicinity of his farm was US $7.10 per bushel, while the price necessary to cover the cost was US $8.50.
U.S. farmers have set a record high for soybean cultivation this year, and the harvest is expected to reach a record high.
At such a time of easy shock, they have been hit by a trade war.
In response to Trump's imposition of tariffs on imports of Chinese goods, China imposed tariffs on imports of American soya beans in July.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture will release its first forecast of the area under cultivation next year, which will include consideration of the impact of tariffs.
It is expected that the forecast will confirm the expectation of private institutions that soybean planting area will be reduced.
On October 19, according to a report seen by Luta Economics, the area under corn cultivation will increase by 4% to 92.7 million acres (37.5 million hectares) in 2019, and the area under soybean cultivation will be reduced by 7% to 83 million acres.
It is also expected that the area under wheat cultivation in the United States will increase by 4 per cent.
The area of soybean planted prior to the implementation of the return tariff rose to 89.6 million acres this year, about 15 million acres higher than 10 years ago.
Corn cultivation has increased by less than 5 million acres since 2008 to 89.1 million acres, and wheat cultivation this year is 47.8 million acres, close to the lowest level in 100 years.
Aron Carlson, the president of the Corn Planting Institute in Illinois, has a total of 3,600 acres of cultivation, and this year he has spent nearly half of it on soya, but plans to cut it in the future.
He said it is possible to increase corn cultivation by up to 20% at his farm in northern Illinois, which is the largest soybean growing state in the United States.
Soybean production per acre is lower than corn, but it also requires less fertilizer, which makes it less expensive for soybean to grow in general.
If farmers move to end-to-end corn, it may raise costs, but it will benefit a number of businesses, including Anderland Inc. 'S fertilizer sellers.
Anderland Chief Executive Pat Bowe said he expected the switch to corn to be beneficial for fertilizer use.
Bayer is also expected to benefit from farmers switching to corn.
Sutirava, the head of Bangkok's Langman Airport Authority, held a press conference on the 29th, apologizing for the beating of a Chinese citizen at the airport and saying that Thailand welcomes Chinese tourists. Relevant authorities will strengthen management, raise awareness of services and avoid similar incidents.
According to the report, on the 27th, the security guard of Langman airport had a physical conflict with a Chinese man who was denied entry.
Sutirava said the security guard was acting in a serious breach of discipline and that the airport authority had suspended him and set up a commission of inquiry to investigate the matter in accordance with the procedure. If the matter is true, the security guard will be withdrawn.
At present, the Thai Immigration Service has arranged for the man to return to China by plane.
Sutirava expressed regret for the incident, which damaged the image of Thailand, and said that Thailand attached great importance to the matter, was willing to do its utmost to reduce the impact of the incident on the beaten tourists, and would send a letter of thanks to the parties through the Chinese Embassy in Thailand.
He said that Langman Airport is willing to provide convenience for Chinese tourists to Thailand, and jointly with the Thai Immigration Bureau, set up special entry channels for Chinese tourists at the five major international airports in Bangkok, including Suvannapu, Langman, Qingmai, Phuket and Heai.
He said that the next step of the Airport Authority will be to reform the site signing area, explicitly sign the fees, and improve the service quality and communication skills of the staff.
After learning of the matter, the Chinese Embassy in Thailand contacted the party concerned at the first time to find out what had happened.
At the same time, the person in charge of the Thai Immigration Bureau, the Airport Authority and the Ministry of Tourism and Sports made an intervention, demanding that the Thai side thoroughly investigate the incident and severely punish the perpetrators, and will continue to maintain close communication with the Thai side, properly handle the matter and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the parties concerned.
Xinhua International Time Review: To safeguard multilateralism, China knows that it is one and the same.
The international rules and multilateral order are under attack at a time when the tide of universitism is surging.
To some extent, the intersection of one-sided and multilateralism has entered a critical period.
As a responsible and powerful country, China has worked with the international community to safeguard multilateralism and promote the continuous advancement of multilateralism, based on the concept of keeping pace with the great potential and the path of cooperation and solid and vigorous actions.
In the face of the new situation and new challenges, China has made a loud voice on the direction and path of the development of multilateralism.
As Wang Yi, member of the National People's Congress and Minister for Foreign Affairs, said in his speech during the general debate of the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, multilateralism in the new era should adhere to the goal of cooperation and win-win, be based on rules and order, be guided by justice and be guided by effective action.
At the same time, China calls for the construction of a global development cooperation pattern with the United Nations as the core, North-South cooperation as the main channel, and South-South cooperation as a complement, and calls on all parties to work together to build a community for the destiny of mankind.
China's thinking and voice reflect the mainstream voice of the international community.
As President Espinoza of the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly said, in the current situation, "the United Nations needs to promote multilateralism and uphold a rules-based international system more than ever."
Lagarde, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, said that the international community should continue to firmly safeguard the multilateral trading system, adhere to the rules of international trade and resolve differences through consultation.
In recent years, with the adjustment of the global economic and political forces, a number of emerging markets and groups of developing countries have emerged, playing a greater role in the major international multilateral mechanisms, and providing a new impetus for the development of multilateralism in the face of headwinds.
In view of this dimension, the concept of multilateralism, such as building a large family rather than putting together a small circle and sticking to the idea of co-operation and co-construction rather than winner-take-all, advocated by China, follows the trend of the times and is an inevitable choice to deal with global challenges and solve the world's difficult problems, and represents the common aspiration of most countries in the world.
There are advanced ideas and more solid actions.
The "Belt and Road" initiative proposed by China has become the largest platform for international cooperation.
China has launched international and regional cooperation initiatives such as the "One Belt, One Road," the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the "16 + 1 Cooperation" to promote international regional cooperation, improve and complement the existing international system and order, bring innovative vitality to multilateralism cooperation, and contribute to the development of the international order in a more just and rational direction.
As a defender of the international order and a champion of multilateralism, China's actions have become more and more powerful in the multilateral arena of the United Nations.
Good offices in international hot spots, addressing climate change, participating in peacekeeping operations, making great efforts to reduce poverty and reduce poverty, and helping other countries implement the 2030 sustainable development agenda.
As UN Secretary-General Guterres said, China has become an important pillar of multilateralism.
When the "trust deficit" facing the world intensifies, when populism and polarizing trends rise, it is at a time when the world needs multilateral cooperation most urgently.
At this historical juncture, the international community needs to join hands, turn consensus into action, resolutely defend multilateralism, and jointly promote the building of a community for the destiny of mankind.
On September 30, the first national standard 4K demonstration district of Guangdong Province was unveiled at the Jongcheng Garden District, Haizhu District, Guangzhou City. On the same day, the operation of 4K in the whole province of Guangdong Guang TV network was officially launched, and the opening ceremony of the 4K ultra-high Qingqing Channel of the Central Broadcasting Television Station was held in parallel.
The event of the day was jointly hosted by Guangdong National Broadcasting and Television Network Co., Ltd., and the leadership group of the joint construction and shared social governance work in Dantang District, Haizhu District.
According to the deployment of the provincial government of Guangdong Provincial Committee, the Guangdong Guangzhou Television Network is actively implementing the new digital home 4K action plan. In December 2017, the first national digital home network terminal product to support IPv6 and the first national wi-fi network to support the 4-road 4K concurrency - "U-Point Home server" (equipped with an AVS2 standard 4K box and a radio voice remote control device) was released to accelerate the construction of the development of the 4K of the digital network of the digital network.
In 2018, the Guangdong Guang TV Network launched a series of measures for the benefit of the people, and launched the "4K Service Month" to promote the "U Point Home server" across the province.
On the day of the event, the 4K business across the province was officially launched. The first 4K smart TV safe home sharing platform based on the 4K application was also officially lit up. The platform was jointly built by Guangdong Line and the office of the shared social governance leadership team in Dantang District, Haizhu District. The platform project is based on the 4K ultra-clear U-point home server of the Guangdong Guang TV network, which is designed to provide a new-based service service service to provide the new people and the public.
Chen Xiaoli, chief engineer of the Guangdong Provincial Press and Broadcasting Bureau, said at the event that the event was a useful cooperation between the government center of the party committee for the active service of the network enterprises and the government's active use of "Internet +" to build a "digital government" to serve the people. It is hoped that through cooperation and promotion, the Guangdong Guang TV network can help build a model of shared governance in Haizhu District, Guangzhou and even the province.
At the ceremony, a new digital home application, with 4K TV as the core, was displayed and made widely available on the 4K smart TV safe home sharing platform.
The first phase of the "4K smart TV safe home sharing platform" will feature four modules, namely, "Guangzhou Street Square," "New Guangzhou People's Home," "Smart Community" and "Smart Family," which will focus on exploring the construction of smart communities.
It is reported that the Guangdong Guang TV network has now opened five sets of 4K live channels. Guoqing will also launch the 4K ultra-high-tech channel of the central radio and television station exclusively in the province on the same day.
The report reads as follows: On September 30, it is the fifth anniversary of the country's martyrdom.
At 10 a.m. on the same day, the leaders of the Communist Party and the state, such as Xi Jinping, together with representatives from all walks of life in the capital, attended the ceremony of laying a flower basket to the people's heroes.
The CCTV published a quick review of this: This is the first martyr's day after the implementation of the law on the protection of heroes and martyrs in China.
Five years ago, the anniversary of the martyrs was set on the eve of the national celebration, revealing the great journey of the Chinese nation from suffering to glory. We should always be alert: "Where do we come from, and where do we go?"
"To abandon tradition and throw it away is to cut off one's own spiritual lifeblood," the general secretary of Xiu Yuping pointed out in depth.
"The future can only be opened up if history is not forgotten."
We should always bear in mind the history, continue the strong spirit of the United Kingdom and consolidate the powerful positive energy of the national renewal.
The quick review pointed out that Yingliang is the backbone of the nation.
To honor the martyrs and sacrifice the martyrs is to make Britain a noble, sacred and powerful lasting memory at the bottom of our hearts.
According to incomplete statistics, some 20 million martyrs lost their lives to national independence, the liberation of the people, the prosperity of the country and the happiness of the people.

The fifth "Disabled Voice Month" came to pay attention to the issue of sex education for disabled teenagers - China New Network
In recent years, the topic of sex education for young people in China has been widely discussed, but the challenge for sex education for disabled teenagers is still formidable.
Recently, a workshop on the challenges and practical strategies of comprehensive sexuality education for people with disabilities was held in Beijing.
How to educate disabled children and young people about sex has become an important topic of this workshop.
The report on sexual knowledge, attitudes and behaviour of disabled children and young people in China, released at the meeting, showed that the proportion of disabled children subjected to sexual harassment and abuse is higher than that of healthy children.
For disabled children and young people, more social attention is also paid to "sexual protection."
The purpose of this symposium is to explore the promotion of comprehensive sexuality education for disabled children and young people in China from the aspects of family support, school education and institutional services, and to provide support to disabled children and young people at the source so that they can enjoy the right to love on their own, as well as other people.
Experts believe that, for a long time, the public awareness of disabled groups in Chinese society has remained at a level that is not in depth enough.
Influenced by traditional ideas and other factors, China's comprehensive sexuality education for people with disabilities, especially disabled children and young people, has not gone far enough.
In recent years, however, with the support of UNESCO and public welfare people, the practice and realization path of sexual and reproductive health education for people with disabilities in China have developed in an all-round way.
The Report shows that children and young people with visual, hearing, intellectual and physical disabilities may have more difficulties in acquiring sexual knowledge and understanding intimate relationships than the general population, but have generally developed toward convenience and enrichment.
Organized by the Shanghai Foundation for the Public Interest of Persons with Disabilities, the UNESCO Representative Office in China, the International Union for the Disabled (France) Beijing Representative Office and the United Nations Population Fund Representative Office in China, the workshop aims to jointly explore the comprehensive development of sexual and reproductive health education practices and implementation pathways for persons with disabilities in the context of the overall strategy of healthy China, promote policy makers, educators, researchers, social service organizations, and representatives of children with disabilities in special education, and other stakeholders, and other stakeholders, and other stakeholders in the development.
Beijing, Sept 30 - The Central Bank of China on Sunday released data on the scheduled short-term net outflows of foreign currency assets, showing that as of the end of August this year, the foreign currency of the central bank was zero for the first 12 consecutive months against the forward and futures contracts of this currency, and that there was still no more than one head in the month.
The central bank's previous data showed that as of the end of August last year, the central bank held a total of US $6.044 billion in foreign currency-to-currency forward contracts and futures contracts, which was unchanged for the fourth consecutive month. The size of the empty head in terms of foreign currency (special drawing rights) was US $4.276 billion.
Since then, the central bank's foreign-exchange head-to-head has been zero.
The central bank released the data for the first time at the end of March 2016; the data showed that at the end of February 2016, the central bank had an excess of US $2,438 million in foreign currencies against forward and futures contracts and US $28.9 billion in empty heads.
For the first time, the September data released at the end of October of the same year showed a net increase of US $16.401 billion to US $4.401 billion.
The central bank has previously said that the forward and futures headers of foreign currencies on this currency mainly reflect the foreign exchange forward operations carried out by the central bank with commercial banks in order to meet the requirements of the foreign currency liability guarantee period, and will continue to provide forward risk avoidance products according to the principle of real needs. The impact of the forward operations of the central bank on the size of future foreign exchange reserves will be relatively small.
On the evening of September 20, this year, on the K158 train, Joe, who was a junior in Zhengzhou, took the bus to the crane wall.
On the train, a great man bought no ticket, but took her seat: "Take a shot."
After a two-hour drive, the captain of the bus advised him that an hour was still not valid.
In the end, one of the male passengers in the same carriage couldn't look down and pull the old man up.
From the point of view, although most of the final results are that the bullies are condemned by the public, punished by the public security department, and even included in the honest black list, the public still feels that they are not "disgruntled": Why not allow the bullies to be punished on the spot?
Why not stop his unethical and even illegal behavior on the spot, but punish it afterwards?
How is it that a male passenger is pulled up because of the unreasonable behavior of the "bullies?"
The main reason for this is that only long-distance trains are equipped with police, and short-distance trains are generally absent. Even if there are police officers, the police are concerned about the possible passive response of the bullies and do not take measures to force them to leave.
Repeated bullying incidents have made people realize that bullies must be forced to leave or even punished on the spot in order to act as a shock.
This requires that our train police should dare to take strong measures in a timely manner. Trains without police should be equipped with police officers as soon as possible in order to prevent and combat illegal activities in a timely manner.
On October 1, the first day of the long holiday of Guoqing, there was a sharp increase in the number of vehicles going to Song Pan, Mau County, via the Sui Autonomous County of Beicheng, Sichuan Province.
At about 13 o'clock, the Beicuan traffic police received a call for help, saying that their family members had been involved in a traffic accident in Song Pan. Due to the limited medical conditions in the area, they are in urgent need of being sent to Miyang for treatment.
At the same time, one-way traffic control is carried out on the Lake Beltway Road in Tonjiashan, Beichan. I would like to ask the traffic police to release the 120 emergency rescue vehicles.
After receiving the call for help, the police on duty promptly reported the situation to the large team. After the captain Huang Xuemin had a brief understanding of the situation, he immediately arranged for the police on duty at the control point to contact the person seeking help, and requested that all efforts be made to carry out the escort work.
"At that time, there were more than 1,000 vehicles entering the controlled section of the road. After contact with 120 emergency vehicles, it is expected that the time of arrival in Beicuan will be around 15: 00, and we will arrange the deployment immediately."
In order to prevent vehicles that have entered this section of the road from running in parallel with each other, the traffic police carried out sub-control of the vehicles at the beginning, middle and end of the road one hour in advance, and reminded all passing drivers to turn away from the road in order to rescue the vehicles in case of emergency, said the captain of the middle team of Beichan traffic police.
Subsequently, the police of the team also temporarily stopped the vehicles entering the control section of the road, and lined up for the 120 emergency vehicles that were about to arrive.
At about 15: 00, a Sichuan U license plate ambulance drove into Beicuan territory. Beichan traffic police sent a police vehicle to open the road and escorted the emergency truck all the way into the control section.
It is understood that some places along the Lake Road can only pass by one vehicle, and the police have temporarily controlled these places ahead of time, ensuring the smooth passage of 120 emergency vehicles.
At the time of arriving at the 10-mile monument village in Binping township, there was a section of road that could not be allowed to go wrong, so the traffic police made contact with the village committee in advance, used the village road to bypass and banned social vehicles from entering the village.
"It only took 40 minutes for the Beicuan traffic police to pick up 120 emergency vehicles and drive into the normal road on the 302 provincial road."
According to the normal situation, it takes four hours for the entire passage time to be passed, according to the author.
"This arrangement has successfully secured valuable treatment time for patients."
It is reported that at 17: 20, the seriously ill person was sent to Miyang in time for treatment.
The confirmed death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen rapidly to 832, and authorities fear the number will rise as rescue workers struggle to provide assistance to remote areas that have lost contact.
Of particular concern is Dungra, an area north of Balu with a population of 300,000, close to the earthquake.
Two other areas have been out of touch with the outside world since Friday.
"We have yet to receive reports from the other three regions."
Communications and electricity continue to be disrupted.
Nuganho said five foreigners were among the missing, three of whom were French, a Korean and a Malaysian.
The earthquake and tsunami killed 832 people.
Indonesia's Vice President Kala said the death toll could rise to thousands at the meeting.
Earlier, Indonesian President Joko Widodo had made a survey of the disaster area and appealed to the people to be patient.
November 4 - Britain's Daily Telegraph reports on Sunday that Dominic Raab, Britain's minister for desegregation, has privately demanded the UK's right to "safeguard" arrangements from the Irish border after three months.
The report said Mr Rab made the request to Ireland's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Simon Koveney, at a private meeting in London last Tuesday.
The report said the request was a "clear contradiction" to the comments made by David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, when he visited Dublin three days later.
The UK Department of European Affairs said it would not comment on private meetings.
At 8: 05 am yesterday morning, two suspects of shoplifting were caught shoplifting at the 20-bus Yongding Gate Station to the Pearl Market Station.
Two shoplifting men cut the pocket of the passenger's coat and stole 800 yuan of cash from it, allowing the police, who had been sitting nearby, to grab it.
This is the first case of shoplifting by the Beijing police during Guoqing.
At more than 5 o'clock in the morning, the anti-theft detectives of the Beijing Public Security Mobile Investigation Team arrived at their scheduled position.
According to past experience, where the flow of people is concentrated, the public exchange hub and the public exchange railway line, including the people watching the flag raising in Tiananmen Square, are the key areas of their work.
In the flow of people, the civilian police in civilian clothes calmly observed the passing crowd.
At more than 7 o'clock in the morning, detectives who were crouching at the bus stop found two suspicious men following a male passenger onto the bus number 20 from Yongding Gate.
In the vehicle, two suspicious men, one on the left and the other on the right, held the male passenger in the middle, one of whom tried to cover the other.
They did not know, however, that their own movement had already fallen into the eyes of the civilian police in civilian clothes who were watching.
In the process of waiting for the man to steal, the policeman looked at the man who was preparing for the shoplifting, and was caught by the detective after they had made the shoplifting.
The Beijing Morning News reporter saw that the police seized 800 yuan in cash from the theft suspects.
"They took the money out of the passenger's clothes pocket."
Pointing to a broken coat pocket, the policeman said: "They cut the place open and stole 800 yuan from a passenger who came to Beijing. When we caught them, the money was just put into their own pocket."
The reporter learned that in order to catch the two men, the civilian police in civilian clothes followed them for an hour, and finally got a shot in the face when they made the case.
The two suspects are currently under police review.
The civilian police in civilian clothes told reporters who was suspicious in the crowd, which is a simple question for the police.
"When thieves catch more, they will find that, unlike ordinary passengers, they look at people's pockets and backpacks. They also like to drill into the crowd rather than hide away from people."
The police also told reporters that the suspects often have no purpose to wait for the car, like to swim in the station, find the object of the shoplifting, and will only follow the car.
"It's all about experience. The clothes have been dry for a long time, and it's natural to know."
In addition, the police also pointed out that "it is most convenient to put things in the outer pocket, and it is also the most vulnerable to theft."
During the ride, you should pay attention to your own property so as not to be stolen.

British Prime Minister Theresa May on Sunday called on her party to unite behind her Brexit plan, directly calling on critics to back it, saying the free trade deal they want is at the heart of her Brexit plan.
On September 30, 2018, British Prime Minister Theresa May went to attend a meeting of the Conservatives in Burmingham, England.
At the start of the Tory party's heated annual meeting, Theresa May's plans were again attacked by two former interior ministers, including former Foreign Secretary John Johnson, who described Theresa May's plans as "misogyny."
But she also received strong support from other ministers who backed Brexit, who "praised Theresa May as one of the most polite people," and International Trade Secretary Foxx and Foreign Secretary Hunt pointed their ire at the EU.
Theresa May's already fragile leadership has come under further pressure this month after the EU rejected parts of the so-called "Cickers" plan.
But Theresa May took a positive view of the consultations, saying she was prepared to consider the EU's doubts.
"My message to the self-employed parties is that let's work together to find the best deal for the UK," Theresa May said.
Johnson, the former British foreign secretary, called Theresa May's plan "a mess" and attacked her for not having confidence in Brexit.
He and Davis, the former UK secretary of state for Europe, are pushing for a Canadian-style free trade deal with the EU.
Theresa May, for her part, said the proposal would allow Northern Ireland to implement different tariff rules, which would amount to Northern Ireland breaking away from the UK.

The number of people smuggled through this corridor has been significantly reduced after Turkey controlled it under an agreement signed with the European Union in March 2016.
But since this year, there has been a backlash in the number of people who have been smuggled along the route.

In recent years, there have been a number of incidents in which the campus plastic track has failed to meet the requirements.
To this end, the Ministry of Education issued a notice requiring the implementation of the new national standard for the surface sports sites of primary and secondary school synthetic materials to be delivered for use after November 1 this year.
The compulsory national standard, "Sports Field for Synthetic Materials in Primary and Secondary Schools," was organized by the Ministry of Education and drafted with the participation of 26 scientific research institutes and testing institutions. After more than two years of revision, more than 100 expert meetings were organized during the period, as well as field visits and sampling tests nationwide, and verification experiments were collected for the non-counting of the products of hundreds of enterprises in the market.
According to the old national standard of 2005, the reporter found that the new national standard not only changed from "national recommended standard" to "national mandatory standard," but also added a number of contents, including thickness requirements, physical properties, aging resistance, inorganic packing content requirements, anti-skid rubber content requirements, hazardous substance limit for finished products, non-solid and solid raw materials, and so on.
In particular, it is worth mentioning that the new national standard has qualified the harmful substances that may be produced in the construction of plastic track on campus, increasing from the original 7 to 18, and stipulated the limit of the floating organic matter of the runway after construction in accordance with the standard of home fitting.
For example, the release of harmful substances is clearly defined in the "limit and smell requirements of hazardous substances in cast-in-place and prefabricated surface products," requiring that the total volatile organic compounds shall not exceed 5 mg / m3, that the meth shall not exceed 0.4 mg / m3, that the dithiocarbon shall not be higher than 7 mg / m3, that the benzene shall not exceed 0.1 mg / m3, and that the smell level shall not be higher than 3.
The new GB also made detailed provisions on the sampling requirements, inspection rules, judging rules and other issues of plastic track in primary and secondary school campuses.
In addition, the artificial lawn on campus has also been included in the mandatory testing scope of GB for the first time.
In the near future, all regions should carry out special work and deployment on the implementation of the new national standard and report the implementation of the new national standard to the Department of Sports Health and Art Education of the Ministry of Education in the course of the year.

Both sides followed suit, both in preparation for the fight and in front of the game.
When they reached the final, the two men said that they had completed the task of the competition.
However, the comparison between Ding Ning and Zhu Yu-ling in the competition can be regarded as a sword and sword shadow.
In the first innings, Ding Ning, who had the best experience in the competition, took a 3: 1 lead in the opening set. Later, Zhu Yu-ling followed up the score with the help of Ding Ning's error to make it 3-level.
After that, Zhu Yu-ling's error in the attack began to increase. Ding Ning took a 3-9-5 lead and took the lead with 10-6.
Although Zhu Yu-ling chased for three points, Ding Ning took advantage of the ball to take the first set at 11: 9.
In the second innings, Zhu Yu-ling's error remained high, and Ding Ning took advantage of his holding to lead by 6: 1 from a distance.
Zhu Yu-ling was 2: 7 behind, relying on a change of pace to score two points, and then used the attack to chase the score to 8: 9 at one point.
At the critical moment, Ding Ning scored 2-11-8 to win another game.
In the third set, the two men opened the game with a tight 3-3 draw.
Tinging then lost three more points in the attack, but she then took advantage of the Alli attack to score three to drive the score to six.

Last month, Ding Ning won the crown in the open competition in Bulgaria, ending her 14-month-old championship, and this time came to Chengdu, although she said before the race that she had not set a target for the competition, and in the semi-final at the end of the morning, Ding Ning said that she had completed her task.
In the end, Ding Ning beat her teammate Zhu Yu-ling to win her third individual World Cup title. She expressed satisfaction with her performance. "A championship is very important for every athlete.
I didn't think of this before the game. I just said that I would go to the game and play in the final. "
"I think I can handle the whole game in terms of pressure. Today, Ding Ning's performance has been so excellent that she has never found a rhythm," said Zhu Yuiling, a brother-in-law of the main field, who received a silver card and failed to achieve the goal of defending the title. She said of whether the enthusiastic audience of the main field would cause invisible pressure on herself.
To activate rural consumption, it is necessary to clean up the market by means of the normal mechanism, guide the demand for healthy consumption, and enhance farmers' sense of access to consumption.
According to the data, the consumption potential of rural residents has been continuously released, and the retail sales of rural consumer goods increased by 10.5% in the first half of this year, an increase of 1.3 percentage points higher than that of urban areas.
During a visit to a poor village in a western county, the village had only one convenience store, and entered the store. Some commodities were familiar. The "golden dragon fish" was marked as "gold dragon oil," the "Wanzi" became "Wang milk" and the "mountain village" merchandise was quite a lot.
Over the years, similar phenomena have come to light frequently, and some rural fake and inferior goods have become famous brands, with similar names, similar packaging, and false and false facts, which are too much to prevent.
According to a consumer survey report released by a city in the western part of the country, the problem of super-counterfeit goods in rural areas is serious. 66% of users have bought fake goods in the supermarket under the township line, with food accounting for more than half of the total.
The relevant departments rectify the rural market, shouting and beating year after year, why is the "Li ghost" still fighting?
Unlike the urban market, farmers' awareness of rights protection is relatively weak, coupled with the fact that many rural areas are remote and are in blind areas where the regulatory power is inadequate, allowing fake and inferior commodities to have breeding grounds.
Some departments control the price, some control the production, some control the market, the functions of the cross-cutting, the annual holiday, the centralized management of the wind, the fake goods hiding in the wind, and slowly emerging, just after the old vacation, the new holiday.
In the absence of a long-term effective supervision mechanism, it is difficult to clean up the rural market, the costs of breaking the law are low and the benefits are large. This has led some illegal merchants to take advantage of the idea of "going up and down the mountains and villages," and some rural areas have become a "waste elimination market."
From warm and full to Xiao Kang, the vast majority of farmers are moving toward development-oriented consumption.
Recently, the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the State Council issued "Some opinions on improving the mechanism of promoting consumption system to further stimulate the consumption potential of residents," in which they proposed to promote the upgrading of the consumption ladder of rural residents, with the aim of allowing farmers to "be able to consume" and "dare to consume" so that rural consumption can truly flourish.
On the one hand, it is necessary to deepen the reform, eliminate the malpractices of market supervision and management, and improve the network of supervision over food safety and product quality due to proper local control, and continuously reduce the space for the production and sale of fake products in rural areas.
On the other hand, law enforcement efforts should be stepped up, and the regulation of "capillaries" should not be allowed to breed and spread in rural areas.
Strict punishment of pit farmers is the protection of farmers. No matter how hidden the fake makers are, they should not become the reason for the breeding of fake and bad commodities. The relevant departments should make clear their responsibilities, and the grassroots supervision forces should be sunk. If any problems arise, they should be held responsible, so as to allow the fake makers and sellers to hide themselves.
We must strictly control market access, impose strict qualification checks on producers and traders, keep the market circulation closed, let the products come and go straight and clear, and find ways from the source and root, so as to allow legitimate dealers to operate safely, so that farmers can be assured of buying.
To activate rural consumption, it is necessary to guide the demand for healthy consumption.
Along with the upgrading of consumption, many farmers not only seek to eat enough and eat well, but also pursue a high-quality life such as culture and health. They cannot match the rural market with the "low-quality" "low-cost" painting and so on.
This requires promoting the extension of e-commerce to the vast rural areas, opening up urban and rural two-way connected marketing channels, promoting the integration of offline industrial development platforms and online e-commerce trading platforms, and supporting the expansion of new patterns of consumption to rural markets; promoting the organic integration of commercial logistics with leisure agriculture, rural tourism, product processing, etc.; and improving the modern rural circulation network system, optimizing the integration of stock facilities resources and effectively reducing rural circulation costs.
To create a clean and secure market environment for rural areas, so that farmers do not care about consumption, rural consumption can become more and more prosperous, so as to enhance farmers' sense of access to consumption and happiness.
From November 1, China will reduce the most-favoured-nation tariff rate for some commodities, and the total tariff level will be reduced to 7.5%.
In accordance with the decision of the 26th Executive Meeting of the State Council, the State Council Customs and Tax Commission issued a notice on the 30th, which will reduce the most-favoured-nation tariff rate for some commodities as of November 1, 2018.
In accordance with the "Notice of the State Council's Customs and Tax Commission on the Reduction of the tariff on the import of some commodities," in order to meet the needs of industry upgrading, reducing the cost of enterprises and meeting the multi-level consumption of the masses, the most-favoured nation tariff rate for some industrial goods and other commodities will be lowered from November 1 this year.
A total of 1,585 tax items were subject to tax reduction, accounting for about 19% of the total tax items in China. The average tax rate fell from 10.5% to 7.8%, with an average reduction of 26%.
This tax reduction mainly covers textiles; stone, ceramics, glass products; some iron and steel and base metal products; mechanical equipment and components, such as metal processing machinery, textile machinery, engineering machinery, power transmission equipment, electrical equipment, instruments, etc.; resource commodities and primary processing products, such as non-metal mines, non-machine chemicals, wood and paper products, and precious stones, etc.
At the same time, with the reduction of the total tariff level, in particular the import tariff on pharmaceuticals and consumer goods for daily use, the tariff rate of import tax on imported goods will be lowered accordingly.
In order to implement the decision-making and deployment of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, China has implemented zero tariffs on the vast majority of imported drugs since May 1 this year, reduced import tariffs on automobiles, parts and components, and some consumer goods for daily use from July 1, and implemented the third step of reducing tariffs on products covered by the information technology agreement.
Reporters learned from the State Council's Customs and Tax Commission that since this year, after several consecutive autonomous adjustments, the total tariff level of China will be reduced from 9.8% in the previous year to 7.5%, with an average reduction of 23%.
The appropriate reduction of tariffs is conducive to promoting the balanced development of foreign trade, promoting a higher level of opening up to the outside world, as well as making overall use of both international and domestic resources, and promoting structural reform on the domestic supply side.
The person in charge of the committee said that this year marks the 40th anniversary of the reform and opening-up, and that the voluntary reduction of the total tariff level is a practical action to implement the spirit of the important speech made by the General Secretary of the People's Republic of China at the Boao Asia Forum. It is also an important measure for China to further expand its openness and expand its imports according to its own high-quality development needs. This action and measure shows that China will adhere to the strategy of opening and win, and enhance the development of China.
On September 29, the launch of the regional public brand of agricultural products of the "people around the countryside" in the district of Nankai in the city of Tianjin was held in the province of Ganyuan.
Red army rice, black bean, mountain boy ranching black goat, hard-packed bitter tea, clipped paper shadow book, pure hand-pulled shoes... One piece of beautifully packed agricultural produce is neatly placed on the exhibition stand, and they have a common brand name known as "the people of the country."
"To build a regional brand of" people in the countryside "has effectively solved the development bottleneck of" many scattered, small and weak "agricultural products in the county, and has become a powerful carrier for poverty eradication." On the 29th, the "people in the countryside" regional public brand of agricultural products hosted by Gangyao County was held in Nankai District, Tianjin City.
The surrounding county is located at the boundary of the three provinces of Shaanxi and Ganning, and has a long history and rich resource collection as the "advanced county of national grain production" and the "township of small and mixed grain in China."
Sheep's meat, yellow rice wine, red noodles, soft noodles and other places to eat is a taste that is often recalled by tourists in other countries.
With the continuous improvement of the level of urbanization in China, the urban population has increased rapidly, and a large number of young people from rural areas have left their hometown to begin urban life.
"Now that urban life is fast and stressful, more and more people are beginning to miss the rural life when they were young. However, the most beautiful memory is the countryside. The design of the brand is named after the homesickness and homesickness of the people who live in the surrounding counties," said Yang Jiajia, an expert on agricultural brands in China.
Around the county, the climate conditions are special, the time of sunlight is long, the temperature of the night is bad, and the special conditions for the cultivation of small and mixed grains are unique.
There are more than 20 kinds of small and miscellaneous grains produced in China, which is home to China's small and miscellaneous grains. The output is the highest in the country, and the quality is at the forefront of the country.
Wang Xiaoli, a girl from around the county who went to school in Tianjin, attended the promotional meeting as a volunteer. She said: "The hometown people are the closest and the hometown tastes the most beautiful. The brand of" people around the country "brings up too many of our homesickness and memories. It is also the cuisine of the time when we think about it. It is hoped that the brand of" people around the country "will go further and bigger."
Dr Tan Bin, a researcher at the Scientific Research Institute of the National Food and Material Reserve Bureau, said that through the detection of more than 900 sets of index data, the testing data of buckwheat, bitter corn and black beans in the county were prominent, and the content of many biological active substances in miscellaneous grains was higher than the standard data. "People in the rural areas" had the inherent advantage of preempting the domestic high-end mixed grain market.
Zhou Chunchun, secretary of the county committee, said that through the release of the brand of "people around the countryside," it will further enhance the quality, standardization and scale innovation and development level of high-quality agricultural products in the county. It will help to create a good overall image of agricultural products in the county, and quickly enhance the visibility, competitiveness and added value.
Canada's gross domestic product (GDP) rose 0.2% in July from the previous month, higher than expected, warming the market's expectation that the Bank of Canada will raise interest rates next month.
If it does, it will be the fifth time in a little more than a year that the central bank has raised interest rates.
Analysts interviewed by Luca had forecast an increase of 0.1%.
Statistics Canada said on Friday that 12 out of 20 industries had seen growth.
The figure is worth noting because the central bank predicted earlier this month that temporary factors could drag on the third quarter of GDP data.
Poloz, the president of the Bank of Canada, promised Thursday that the central bank will continue to gradually raise interest rates and will keep a close eye on economic data.
The Bank of Canada will next announce its interest rate decision on October 24.
The Bank of Canada has raised interest rates four times since July 2017 as Canada's economy has strengthened and unemployment is close to a record low.
Stephen Brown, a senior Canadian economist at Kaibo, said the economy is expected to grow at an annual rate of around 2% in the third quarter of the year.
"This will be higher than the 1.5% expected by the Bank of Canada and will therefore be another reason to expect the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates next month," he said in a report.
The overnight index swap showed that the market's forecast for the rate of interest rate hikes by the Bank of Canada in October rose from 76.46% to 78.27%.
For the first time in 65 years, the Han Dynasty conducted a joint survey on the entry of the Han River into the sea.
The Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Korea confirmed on the 5th day that the Han Dynasty launched a joint survey of the waters of the Han River and the Linjin River entering the Haikou on the same day.
The initiative is a preliminary preparation to guarantee the free navigation of civilian ships on both sides.
According to the briefing provided to the media by the Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Korea on the same day, this is the first time that the two sides have conducted a joint inspection of the Han River entrance to the sea since the signing of the Korean war truce agreement in 1953.
The Han Dynasty signed a military agreement in September this year, agreeing that it will jointly inspect the waters such as the Han River entering the sea mouth from November, in order to ensure environmental protection, development and tourism of the waters in the future.
In October, the Han Dynasty planned a joint survey of the waters during a general military-level meeting.
On November 5, a joint survey of the waters of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was officially launched.
The joint delegation was made up of 20 members of the Korean military, experts and others.
According to the Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Korea, during the inspection, personnel of both sides did not carry weapons and prohibited the use of words and deeds that stimulated the other party.
"Because there is no military demarcation line near the entrance to the sea, the area was an unexpected high-rise area, but through a joint inspection, it will be transformed into a new peaceful zone in the future."
The total length of the waters under the joint Korean-Korean survey is about 70 kilometers, with a total area of about 280 square kilometers.
According to the Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea will send six ships to probe the depth of the sea water and provide basic information for the safe navigation of the waters. After the investigation is completed, navigation maps will be provided for the movement of civilian ships.
The Han Dynasty held a summit meeting in Pyongyang in October 2007 and reached an agreement on the joint use of the Han River and the Linjin River to enter the sea. However, the subsequent talks were complicated by the tense situation on the peninsula.
According to the military agreement signed by the Han Dynasty in September, the ships of both sides will need to notify each other in advance before sailing in the common waters.
According to the news from the website of the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia on November 5, the Chinese citizens Guo Yuxiao and Maulun Xinxin lost their union during the trip to Mongolia recently.
It is understood that the two were members of the Blue Sky rescue team. On October 19, the two men contacted their relatives and friends in the country and said that they were going to explore the mountains near Lake Kusugul immediately. They shared their location through a microletter. After that, they lost contact and were suspected to have gone to no man's land.
The Chinese Embassy in Mongolia has always attached great importance to the protection of the legitimate rights and interests and security of Chinese citizens in Mongolia, as well as to the work of consular protection and assistance.
After learning the news that the two tourists had lost their union, the embassy immediately launched the emergency case of the security guard, and tried to grasp the golden rescue time and make every effort to carry out the work.
The embassy maintained close communication with the families of the persons concerned, assisted the family members to report the case to the Mongolian police immediately, and provided the family members with a list of translators to choose from.
At the first time, the embassy met with the heads of the Ministry of Foreign Relations, the General Administration of Police and the General Administration of Emergency Cases of Mongolia, informed them of the relevant situation, requested the Mongolian side to carry out search and rescue as soon as possible, and maintained close communication with the Mongolian side throughout the search and rescue process, so as to ensure that the latest progress is kept up to date.
At the same time, the embassy assisted the family in issuing a notice of search in Mongolia, and extensively launched the active participation of overseas Chinese and Chinese enterprises in the search for people, providing effective clues, and providing relevant assistance to many blue sky rescue team members who went to Mongolia to assist in the rescue.
Under the strong push of the embassy, Mongolia sent rescue teams at the first time and promised to exempt the search and rescue fees.
The General Police Department and the General Emergency Department instructed the police and emergency departments of the province of Kusougul to make every effort to search and rescue.
As Lake Kusugul is located at the border between Mongolia and Russia in the northern part of the country. It is located in a remote area, with a small area of people and extremely difficult transportation and communication. At present, Mongolia has entered a severe winter. The temperature is as low as 20 degrees below zero. The local police and emergency departments have overcome enormous difficulties. They have mobilized almost all police forces, and launched local herders to carry out a wide range of search and rescue operations around the two people.
At the same time, in view of the special situation of the ranching area, Mongolia has been publishing the notice of search through the broadcast cycle for many days.
The relevant staff of the domestic blue sky rescue team have also come to Mongolia to actively participate in the rescue together with Mongolia.
The safety and security of the two missing members has always been a source of concern for our hearts.
So far, it has been more than 10 days since the two men lost their union, and the embassy has received a number of clues. However, no two people have been found. At present, the search and rescue operation is still in a tense process.
The embassy will always follow the principle of "putting people first," continue to pay attention to the matter, promote the Mongolian side to continue to make every effort to search and rescue, and provide maximum assistance to the families of the parties concerned.
The embassy appealed to Chinese compatriots and enterprises in Mongolia to contact the Chinese embassy in Mongolia at the first time if they learned the relevant clues.
