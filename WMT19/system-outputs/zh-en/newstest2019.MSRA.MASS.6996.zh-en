According to the British media, the US Deputy Secretary of Naval Operations, Admiral William Moran, said that even as the US Navy is revitalizing its strength to cope with the increasingly worrying Russia on both sides of the Atlantic, the United States continues to expand the scope of the Asia-Pacific region - the Pentagon. Including the Indian Ocean - Asia-Pacific - as the focus of the Navy.
According to the British "Jane's Defense Weekly" website reported on September 24, the United States listed China and Russia as strategic competitors in the new national defense strategy announced at the beginning of the year.
Since then, the US Navy has restored the Second Fleet in order to more directly counter Russian activities.
The report said that these moves have caused some doubts and concerns among allies and analysts, who are worried that the US Navy may stay away from the "Asia-Pacific rebalancing" strategy that marks the Obama administration.
But Admiral Moran said that the focus of the US Navy is still the Western Pacific.
On January 24, 2018, at a round-table discussion entitled "Meeting the High Seas Challenge" hosted by the US National Bureau of Asian Research in Washington, he said: "For us, there have been no major changes."
Moran said: "The focus is still on rebalancing, shifting the center of gravity or no matter how you want to describe it."
However, he acknowledged that the United States is closely related to Europe.
He said: "We will continue to focus on the growth of the West Coast and balance what we can do."
Although Moran pointed out that the overall policy on Russia is within the purview of the US Defense Secretary, he warned: "Russians may face demographic and economic challenges, but history proves that if we clash with them, they will be very tough."
Admiral Moran said that as part of the US comeback against Russia, China and other competitors, the US Navy is dynamically deploying troops into a "new combat mode," which will help opponents to US aircraft carrier battle groups or other assets at any given time and place. Where to be unprepared.
He said: "Our Navy and Marine Corps support it - the concept of operational unpredictability, don't appear in the same place again and again, almost like a clockwork - this is our practice."
According to the report, the first to try this new approach was the "Harry Truman" aircraft carrier battle group. The early deployment of the battle group included working visits to the port and patrolling in areas that usually only pass.
Moran said that the US Navy is currently working to ensure that allies know that these warships will still patrol traditional areas and are still solving logistics and family liaison problems for new deployment procedures.
Lieutenant General Michael Noonan, commander of the Royal Australian Navy, also delivered a speech at the event, saying that the Australian military can work seamlessly with the US aircraft carrier battle group.
He said that with the Royal Australian Navy planning to purchase nine more frigates equipped with the "Aegis" combat system, this situation will continue.

Japan's ITOCHU Corporation recognized a $1.3 billion impairment loss on its investment in China's CITIC shares on Friday, writing down its largest corporate investment deal due to trade tensions between China and the United States.
In May 2016, a man walked through the headquarters of Marubeni Co., Ltd. in Tokyo, Japan.
Marubeni said that the trade war hit the US grain sector Gao Hong, which has suspended financial transactions in agriculture.
Some Japanese heavy equipment manufacturers and telecommunications companies have warned about the impact of Sino-US trade frictions when they announced their latest results. Now these Japanese trading companies have joined the ranks.
The United States and China impose tariffs on each other's hundreds of billions of dollars of goods. US President Trump threatens to expand the scope of taxation to more than $500 billion of Chinese goods to the United States if the dispute cannot be resolved.
Tsuyoshi Hachimura, chief financial officer of ITOCHU Corporation, said that the impact of trade disputes on the Chinese economy next year may be even greater.
ITOCHU Corporation and Thailand Bu Bee Group invested $10 billion in CITIC in 2015 to obtain a 20% stake.
Hachimura said that ITOCHU Corporation has a loss of 143.3 billion yen ($1.3 billion) on this part of its shareholding, because it believes that CITIC's share price will not rebound in the near future.
ITOCHU Corporation maintains a profit forecast of 500 billion yen for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019.
In July, China imposed a 25% import tariff on US soybeans to counter Washington's measures in trade frictions.
"Our grain business has been hit by US-China trade frictions," said Yanhong, Marubeni Finance Minister.
He said that Gao Hong has stopped financial transactions in his account since September.
Gao Hong spokesperson Pat Burke pointed out in a statement on Friday that the company's move is "in accordance with internal policy restrictions and due to lack of market opportunities."
He also said that the suspension of financial transactions will not lead to a reduction in jobs.
Marubeni maintains an annual profit forecast of 230 billion yen, which is supported by pulp and paper and power generation.
Sumitomo Corporation announced on Thursday that its profit for the period from April to September increased by 16%, emphasizing that "the trade problems between the United States and China have led to unclear prospects."
Mitsubishi Corporation raised its annual profit forecast to a record level on Friday, due to increased coking coal production and rising prices of commodities such as oil and coal.
Mitsubishi Corporation also announced a new business plan to increase its profit in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022 from an estimated 640 billion yen this year to 900 billion yen ($7.98 billion).
Chinanews.com reported on November 5th that the US mid-term election vote has entered the countdown.
On November 4, President Trump and his Democratic opponents actively "urged" their core voters.
Both major parties pointed out that voter turnout will be the key to the election.
According to reports, in the 48 hours before the American people voted, Trump was busy attending the Republican candidate's rally. Former President Barack Obama went to Indiana to prepare for the election of the Democratic Federal Senate candidate, Joe Donnelly, and called out the final appeal before the election.
On November 4th, Trump went to Megang, Georgia, to stand for the Republican candidate for governor, Brian Kemp. He said: "You must go to the polling station on Tuesday, you must vote."
"The comparison of this election cannot be more clear."
The political enthusiasm of voters has risen to a rare peak, and early voting in some states has far exceeded the usual.
Successive US presidents face the first mid-term election, and the number of members of Congress of his party tends to decrease.
According to a new poll released by the Washington Post and ABC News on the 4th, although the Democratic Federal House of Representatives election still maintains an advantage, Republicans can benefit from economic assessments and Trump's strict attention to border security.
Polls show that registered voters like Democratic House candidates more than Republicans, the ratio is 50% to 43%, but the lead is still 14 percentage points lower than in August.
Another poll conducted by the US National Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) and the Wall Street Journal also showed that Democrats still lead Republicans by 7 percentage points.
It is reported that Obama told the masses on the occasion of Senator Donoli's momentum: "When people don't tell the truth, when words no longer represent anything, it will inevitably have bad consequences.
When people can only lie to themselves, democracy cannot work. "
"The only way to stop these Republicans now is for you and your vote."
The Democratic Party is facing the most difficult election in the Senate for decades. At present, the Republican Party has more than half of the 51 seats.
However, the House of Representatives election is more favorable, and the Democratic Party needs to win another 23 seats to control the House of Representatives with 435 seats.
It is predicted that analysts at the election website FiveThirtyEight.com estimate that the Democratic Party is as likely to win the House of Representatives as 85%.

He has scientifically answered a series of directional, overall and strategic issues. It is a powerful ideological weapon to guide the work of the CPPCC in the new era.
We must conscientiously study and implement this important idea, grasp its great significance, rich connotation and spiritual essence, earnestly work hard to learn and understand, promote the quality of the work of the CPPCC with theoretical study and ideological armed forces, and earnestly shoulder the new mission of the CPPCC in the new era.
From September 29th to 30th, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference held an important ideological and theoretical seminar on strengthening and improving the work of the CPPCC in Beijing.
Wang Yang pointed out that since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, General Secretary Xi Jinping has put forward a series of new ideas and new ideas on strengthening and improving the work of the CPPCC. For the first time, the CPPCC is an important channel for socialist consultation and democracy and a special consultative body. It is an important part of the national governance system. It is the institutional arrangement with Chinese characteristics that first clarifies the characteristics and advantages of the new political party system, emphasizes the correct handling of consistency and diversity, and profoundly reveals that the true meaning of the people's democracy lies in the theory of consultation, and discussion, and discussion, and discussion, and discussion, and discussion, and discussion of the latest political system of the people's theory of the people's theory of the people's political system of the people's political development of the people's political system of the people's political association. "
Wang Yang stressed that the CPPCC at all levels should take the opportunity of theoretical study and discussion to further find the weak links and shortcomings of the CPPCC work, and work hard to strengthen and improve and seek breakthroughs.
It is necessary to comprehensively strengthen the party building of the CPPCC system and ensure that the decision-making arrangements of the Party Central Committee are fully implemented in the work of the CPPCC.
It is necessary to strengthen ideological and political guidance, improve the system, procedures and mechanisms for the "two-way power" of the proposal management and consensus building, and implement ideological and political guidance to all aspects and the whole process of performing duties.
It is necessary to focus on the central task to perform duties and responsibilities, better obey the overall situation of the party and the state, improve the quality of advice and management, and enhance the effectiveness of performance.
It is necessary to strengthen the construction of the CPPCC itself, do a good job in the education and training of members and cadres, play the basic role of the special committee, and consolidate the foundation of the CPPCC.
It is necessary to strengthen the guidance of the work of the local CPPCC, take the direction, demonstrate, solve problems, and improve the overall level of the work of the CPPCC.
In order to thoroughly study and implement Xi Jinping's new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics and the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) system began to carry out General Secretary Xi Jinping's important ideological study and discussion activities on strengthening and improving the work of the CPPCC in May, and held 8 district symposiums and 7 experts and scholars. The symposium identified 18 key topics and 6 basic theoretical topics, with a total of 793.8 million CPPCC members and 279,000 government officials at all levels, forming more than 36,000 research papers.
People's Daily Online, Beijing, November 5th (Wang Xiaoyan) Under the current wave of "mass entrepreneurship, mass innovation," more and more technology companies are paying attention to patent research and development and related protection work, digging deep into the potential value of patents, and occupying market dominance.
Similarly, many technology companies have encountered a lot of infringement in patent technology licensing and patent technology use.
At the end of 2017, Tan Wei, He Zhanghong and Lai Bin from Guangdong Province, on the grounds of patent infringement, brought the developer of the "drip travel" APP, Beijing Xiaotong Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Xiaotong Technology) and the operator Didi Travel Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Didi Travel), and the seller Guangdong Pacific Internet Information Service Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Guangdong Pacific) to the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The three plaintiffs requested the court to order that the three defendants immediately stop manufacturing, selling, promising to sell, and using the plaintiff's patent behavior.
On October 30, 2018, the China Referee Documents Network announced the "Tan Wei, He Zhanghong and Beijing Xiaotong Technology Co., Ltd. and other infringement of the invention patent dispute first instance civil ruling book," disclosed the drip travel APP was sued for patent infringement. Some of the details of the case.
The three plaintiffs believe that the patentee and inventor of the patent for "carpooling service system and method based on mobile terminals," and the entire operation process of the "downwind" application in the "drip travel" APP corresponds to the technical program of patent protection involved, which constitutes a patent infringement.
However, during the court's ruling, Xiaotong Technology believed that Guangdong Pacific was not a suitable defendant. It only provided free downloads of the APP "drip travel" on the Internet, and did not implement the patent method involved. There is no direct or indirect infringement. It should not be listed as a defendant in this case.
Secondly, the infringement of this case is not in Guangdong.
According to the law, the infringement of the patent involved in the case should be the place where the patent method involved is completely implemented. Therefore, the court's jurisdiction is challenged and the case is required to be transferred to the court of the defendant's residence, the Beijing Intellectual Property Court.
The Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court held that the defendant, Guangdong Pacific, provided the alleged infringing drip travel APP product on its online platform. It is not inappropriate for the plaintiff to list the defendant, Guangdong Pacific, as a defendant.
The defendant's Guangdong Pacific residence is in Guangzhou and is within the jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The defendant, Xiaotong Technology, advocated that the case be transferred to the Beijing Intellectual Property Court for trial. On the basis of insufficient evidence, the defendant, Xiaotong Technology Co., Ltd. rejected the objection to the jurisdiction of the case and assumed the expenses for accepting the jurisdiction objection case.
At present, other trials of the case have not been announced, and the reporter will pay close attention to the follow-up details of the drip travel patent infringement case.
Interview with the CEO of the Australian Federal Science and Industrial Research Organization: Australia-China technology cooperation has achieved remarkable results
"China's science and technology have developed rapidly in the past few decades. Australia and China can achieve fruitful results in the field of science."
Larry Marshall, CEO of the Australian Federal Science and Industrial Research Organization, said in an exclusive interview with the China News Agency in Beijing that from the response to climate change to the "Sky Eye" project cooperation, Australia-China cooperation in the field of science and technology has shown great vitality.
As the largest state-level scientific research institution in the Commonwealth of Australia, CSIRO has achieved many innovative research results that have attracted worldwide attention in the fields of ocean, energy, biology, materials and astronomy.
CSIRO has maintained close cooperation with scientific research institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
"This is a lasting friendship that includes a tradition of trust in partners and long-term cooperation." Marshall said.
In May of this year, China's 500-meter spherical radio telescope, "China Sky Eye," installed the first 19-beam L-band receiver in the world.
This is currently the most advanced 19-beam feed receiver in the world, jointly developed by Chinese and Australian scientists.
Marshall said that the successful development of the receiver is based on the technical accumulation of CSIRO for many years. After the launch, the FAST patrol speed will increase by 5 to 6 times, and at the same time, it will expand more scientific observation targets.
"This is a contribution of CSIRO to FAST."
In addition to the above cooperation, CSIRO also has close cooperation with Chinese scientific research institutions in the construction of square kilometer array radio telescopes, research and development of new fuel technologies, energy conservation and emission reduction.
"In the past, scientific research often focused on the problems of hundreds of years later, and now more scientific research is needed to solve the problems in front of us."
Marshall believes that Australia and China are complementary in the field of scientific development, and both countries face a series of challenges in their development.
For example, extreme weather is frequent in the world, droughts and floods have led to a reduction in food production, and food shortages have seriously affected human development.
At the same time, problems such as population explosion, aging, and chronic diseases are also serious challenges.
"The cooperation between Australia and China in recent years is mainly focused on solving these current problems."
Marshall said that the International Southern Hemisphere Marine Research Center, jointly established by CSIRO and Qingdao National Laboratory of Marine Science and Technology, focuses on observing the El Niño phenomenon and La Niña phenomenon, studying the relationship between the two and extreme weather, and establishing extreme weather warning facilities. New varieties of grain developed by CSIRO and the Chinese Academy of Sciences to overcome extreme weather can also alleviate food shortages caused by extreme weather.
"In the current environment, technological innovation is difficult to complete alone, requires extremely high costs, and there are many problems to be solved, so cooperation is particularly important today."
Marshall said that the closer the cooperation, the more likely it is to make breakthroughs. This is also the significance of strengthening cooperation between Australia and China under the "One Belt, One Road" framework.
"Strengthening bilateral cooperation is mainly cooperation in science and technology for us."
Marshall said, for example, that CSIRO has recently developed a gold purification method that does not use cyanide. Because the traditional cyanide gold purification method is very harmful to the environment, many countries hope to find a gold purification method with small environmental pollution.
"We are very willing to introduce this technology to China. This is one of the achievements of our participation in the" One Belt, One Road "cooperation."

North Korean Foreign Minister Li Yonghao told the United Nations on Saturday that continuing to impose sanctions is deepening North Korea's distrust of the United States, and North Korea cannot unilaterally abandon nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Li Yonghao said at the UN General Assembly that North Korea has adopted a "very friendly approach" in the past year, including stopping missiles and nuclear tests, dismantling nuclear test sites, and promising non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we have not seen any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"If you don't trust the United States, you have no confidence in our national security. Under such circumstances, we cannot unilaterally give up weapons first."
Although Li Yonghao repeated North Korea's complaint against the "phased" denuclearization of the United States, his speech is of great significance because it does not completely reject unilateral denuclearization as North Korea did before.
Li Yonghao mentioned the joint statement of Kim Jong-un and Trump on June 12, when Kim Jong-un agreed to work toward "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula," and Trump promised to protect North Korea's security.
North Korea has been seeking to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said North Korea must first give up nuclear weapons.
The United States also refused to relax its demands for international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on" denuclearization first "and increases the pressure on sanctions to achieve the goal in a high-pressure manner, and even refuses to issue a" war end declaration, "" Li Yonghao said.
"The idea that sanctions can make us beg for mercy is that people who don't understand us are daydreaming.
But the problem is that this continued sanctions are deepening our distrust. "
Li Yonghao did not mention the second special gold meeting plan mentioned by the US president at the United Nations earlier this week.
On the contrary, he stressed the three meetings between Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-yin in the past five months and said: "If the other side of denuclearization is South Korea rather than North Korea, then the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula will not become so deadlocked."
China announced that it will reduce import tariffs on 1,585 tax items from November 1, 2018.
Since the beginning of this year, China has taken the initiative to reduce import tariffs.
On May 1 this year, the drug comprehensively reduced the tax, and all ordinary drugs including anti-cancer drugs and alkaloid drugs with anti-cancer effects, and Chinese patent medicines with actual imports were adjusted to zero.
At the same time, it also greatly reduced the value-added tax burden on the production and import of anti-cancer drugs.
On July 1, the tax on cars and parts for 218 tax purposes was reduced.
After the tax reduction, China's automobile vehicle tax rate has been lower than the average level of developing countries, in line with the actual situation of China's automobile industry.
This tax reduction will promote the adjustment of industry structure and the optimal allocation of resources, accelerate the survival of the fittest, help improve the quality of products and services, and is expected to promote the adjustment of automobile prices to a certain extent, so that consumers can get more benefits.
On July 1, the tax on 1,449 daily consumer goods for tax purposes was reduced.
The reduction of taxes on consumer goods for daily use is closely related to the people's needs for a better life.
The tax reduction is not only large in number but also strong, with an average tax reduction of 56%.
The reduction of taxes on consumer goods for daily use directly benefits the majority of consumers and promotes the competitiveness of domestic industries.
On November 1st, the tax reduction will be implemented for 1585 industrial products such as mechanical and electrical equipment, parts and raw materials for tax purposes.
Appropriate reduction of import tariffs on some domestic urgently needed industrial products can attract more foreign investment, help increase domestic effective supply, help industrial upgrading, and help enterprises allocate resources on a global scale and reduce production costs. It is also conducive to reducing the pressure on the domestic environment.
The relevant person in charge of the Customs Tariff Commission Office of the State Council of China introduced that the above four independent tax cuts and the third step tax reduction implemented on July 1 this year in accordance with the information technology agreement to expand the scope of negotiations will reduce China's total tariff level from 9.8% in the previous year to 7.5%.
The adjusted total tariff level is slightly higher than that of the EU, lower than that of most developing countries, at a moderately low level, and basically matches the status and development stage of China's developing countries.
The person in charge introduced that the total tariff level, as one of the important indicators of the openness of China's trade in goods, should be compatible with the stage of China's economic development and reflect the characteristics of the times.
China's trade in goods is the largest in the world and already has the economic base to further expand opening up. However, the quality and efficiency of trade development are still different from those of developed economies. Therefore, the overall tariff level should be appropriately reduced.
Tariffs are a means of protection for compliance. Tariff levels should be compatible with industrial competitiveness. Benign competition should be encouraged. Excessive protection is not conducive to industrial development and quality improvement.
Tariff rate adjustment should take into account production needs and consumption needs.
Focus on reducing the commodity tax rate that is large in domestic demand and conducive to industrial transformation and upgrading, strive to increase the import of characteristic superior products with concentrated needs of the people, continuously enhance the sense of access of enterprises and the public, and meet the upgrading needs of industrial structure and consumption structure.
The intensity of tax reduction should take into account the affordability of fiscal revenue and industrial development.
In the choice of specific tax reduction commodities and tax reduction, we must coordinate and coordinate the two domestic and foreign markets, upstream and downstream aspects, production and consumption, and maintain the development momentum of China's economic stability.
The person in charge stressed that this year is the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up. China's initiative to reduce the overall level of import tariffs is a major measure based on China's own needs to achieve high-quality development. It is conducive to the overall use of international and foreign resources, promote the quality of the domestic supply system, and meet the needs of the people's consumption upgrade.
This action and initiative show that China will unswervingly pursue a mutually beneficial and win-win strategy of opening up, firmly support economic globalization, resolutely safeguard the principle of free trade and the multilateral trading system with the WTO as the core, continue to draw development momentum from opening up to the world, and let China's development better benefit the world.
Serbia announces entry into the highest state of readiness. The President of Serbia and Russia will meet tomorrow to discuss the situation in Kosovo.
The Nantong News Agency quoted the Serbian President's Office as saying that in view of the Kosovo Special Forces occupying the passage of the water storage lake of the Gazivoda Hydropower Station controlled by Belgrade in northern Kosovo, Serbian President Vucic ordered the country's armed forces to enter the highest state of readiness.
On September 29, Serbian Defense Minister Wulin declared that the Serbian army has entered a state of full readiness.
Wulin stressed that as long as the order issued by Vucic is still valid, Serbia will continue to maintain monitoring of the current situation in Kosovo. No matter which direction the situation develops, the Serbian army will respond.
According to the Russian Tass news agency, on September 29, Vucic said in an interview that he has informed the current situation with the United States, Russia and Europe, and will travel to Moscow on October 2 to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Seek Putin's support on the Kosovo issue.
When asked if Serbia needs to get Russian military support like Syria, Vucic gave a negative answer: "I don't want a major military conflict on our territory."
Vucic also said that the Serbian army entered a comprehensive state of readiness only to form a deterrent to prevent the conflict, but this is also a clear warning: absolutely will not tolerate any violence in Kosovo.
The reason why the Serbian army has improved its combat readiness is related to the two major moves in Kosovo.
According to the Serbian side, in recent days, Albanians have been arresting Serbs who have lived in the northern part of Kosovo for generations, and these arrested Serbs have not violated any laws.
Vucic said that since March 26 this year, the head of the Serbian government's Kosovo and Metohija office, Mako Juric, was beaten and detained by the Kosovo Albanian army, the ethnic Albanians have continuously escalated the situation in the region, and the Serbs have been arrested and expelled without humanity.
In addition, more than 100 people including the ROSU special forces, armed police and snipers of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Kosovo, who announced their establishment, occupied the position near the water storage lake of the Gazivoda Hydropower Station and entered the ecological and sports center near the dam in the northern part of Kosovo. And blocked all nearby roads, which were originally controlled by the Serbian side.
Vucic pointed out that this military adventure in Kosovo was made at the instigation of Western countries. The actions of the Kosovo army did not inform the Serbian side in advance, in violation of the first paragraph of Chapter IX of the Brussels Agreement, and also violated the UN Security Council Resolution 1244 and the military technical agreement between Seco.
Vucic has already shouted to NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg, criticizing the hypocritical rhetoric of Western countries on the Kosovo issue.
The root cause of this current conflict is still the historical enmity between the Serbian and Arab communities in Kosovo for hundreds of years.
Regarding the ownership of Kosovo, the Serbs and Albanians have their own opinions.
Serbia regards Kosovo as the birthplace of the nation and the cradle of culture, because Serbia established its strongest country here in the 12th century, and the Albanians only moved in after the Ottoman Empire invaded and the Serbian army retreated to the north.
The Albanians insist that the original tribe of the Illyrians living in Kosovo in the 4th and 5th centuries B.C. is the ancestor of the Albanians. Therefore, Kosovo has been an Albanian territory since ancient times.
Subjective political divisions have caused fierce conflicts among different nationalities, religions and cultures, resulting in fierce confrontation between Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo.
In 1912, Kosovo Albanians first announced the independence of Albania.
After the First World War, a large number of Albanians living in the Balkans moved to Turkey, and the proportion of Serbs increased relatively. In the eyes of the Serbs, the practice of "just taking back their own land" was regarded by the Albanians as the "Great Serbian" plunder, and the contradictions between the two communities intensified.
Kosovo became the "powder keg" of the Balkans.
In 1999, the Albanian separatists in the Kosovo Liberation Army had an armed conflict with the Serbian army and police, which led to the bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia formed by Serbia and Montenegro and the outbreak of the Kosovo war.
On February 17, 2008, Kosovo unilaterally announced its independence from Serbia.
Since then, although there have been reports that Serbia will normalize relations with Kosovo and sign a global and legally binding agreement, due to historical ethnic grievances and geopolitical constraints, agreements that are subject to various forces such as the United States, Europe and Russia have not been signed.
Just a month ago, Vucic made it clear for the first time that he advocated the separation of Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo and once again made the contradictions between the two communities public.
Power communication is still interrupted by Indonesia's strong earthquake and tsunami rescue difficulties
According to figures released by the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency in the early morning of the 30th, a strong earthquake and a tsunami in Dungara County, Central Sulawesi Province, caused 420 deaths.
Wilem Rampangilei, head of the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, said that the figure is only the preliminary statistics of Palu City, Central Sulawesi Province, about 80 kilometers from the epicenter. Due to the lack of large-scale search and rescue machinery, many hotels, shopping malls, warehouses and other crowded buildings damaged by the earthquake have not yet been searched.
On September 29, 2018, local time, a bridge destroyed by the earthquake and tsunami collapsed into several sections in Ba Lu, Indonesia.
Due to the serious damage to power and communication facilities, the epicenter of the earthquake, Dungara County and the neighboring Xiji area are still "isolated islands" that cannot be contacted, and the number of victims cannot be counted.
According to media reports here, Indonesian Vice President Kara said that the number of deaths may reach thousands.
Power outages, communication outages, road blocks, airport damage... The rescue work after the strong earthquake and tsunami is difficult.
Due to power outages, some hospitals and rescue settlements in Palu City need to rely on fuel to generate electricity.
The roads in and out of the city were blocked by landslides, and large-scale transportation vehicles including tanker trucks could not enter, making the fuel supply very tight.
Indonesian Social Minister Agus said that due to road damage, the tents, mattresses, blankets, clothes, food, household goods bags and other emergency relief materials transferred by the Ministry from South Sulawesi and Gorontalo provinces adjacent to the earthquake zone have not yet arrived in the disaster area.
Disaster relief materials transferred from the capital Jakarta are being transported to the disaster area through the Air Force transport aircraft.
In view of the damage to the command tower and runway of Palu Airport in the earthquake, in order to ensure safety and ensure rescue, all commercial flights have been grounded, and only military aircraft carrying relief supplies and personnel have taken off and landed.
Indonesian Political, Legal and Security Affairs Coordinating Minister Wiranto, who directed the rescue in the earthquake zone, demanded that the power supply and airport commercial flight services be restored as soon as possible to ensure the operation of rescue agencies such as hospitals, so that more rescuers and volunteers and aid materials can arrive in the disaster area.
On the 28th, a number of strong earthquakes occurred in Dungara County, Central Sulawesi Province, Indonesia. The 7.7-magnitude earthquake that occurred at 17: 02 local time triggered a tsunami, causing a major disaster in Palu City, Dungara County and Xiji.
China news agency, Beijing, October 1 (Reporter Yin Li) The sky is clear, the sky is clear, and the sky is full of color... Recently, Beijing has continued to open the most beautiful blue sky mode, attracting thousands of people in the capital on the social platform. The fancy picture, in the continuous brushing of the screen, the happiness, said "under the blue sky and white clouds, 'drunk' the beautiful skyline, this is the best business card in Beijing."
Since August, Beijing has ushered in the "bluest sky."
Within the capital, you can see people anytime and anywhere, or take pictures with a smartphone or a SLR camera.
On social platforms such as Weibo and WeChat circle of friends, the Forbidden City, Tiananmen Square, Bird's Nest and Hutong in the lens of netizens can be seen everywhere... All kinds of buildings show different beauty against the blue sky.
Some netizens said that such a "big scenery" is the best city propaganda film in Beijing; some netizens joked that if such a blue sky is long-term brushed, people with cervical spondylosis can be cured; more netizens hope that "this wiping blue can cross the winter and spring and summer, so that the four seasons of the capital are blue."
Why do people in Beijing love to bask in the blue sky?
Only because the people who lived in the city in the past suffered from the smog, they were particularly eager for the blue sky. After the "Blue Sky Defense Battle" was launched in Beijing, the air quality continued to improve, the smog became less, the blue sky increased, and the people saw it. I am happy in my heart, and the happiness I get is particularly weighty.
On the National Day, the weather in Beijing is fine.
At 8 o'clock in the morning, most of the 35 air quality monitoring stations in the city showed "first-class excellent" green.
The "Blue Sky" theme photo contest initiated by the public on the social platform is still in progress.
Why is the sky in Beijing so blue recently?
According to the relevant person in charge of the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, in August this year, the average concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in Beijing was 35 μg / m3, setting a record for the same period in the past five years.
The real-time concentration of PM2.5 in September is more frequent in single digits.
A major factor in the emergence of the "bluest sky" is that the weather conditions in recent times are generally favorable. More importantly, Beijing has consistently carried out air pollution control. In the past five years, it has vigorously promoted the clean air action plan, and the environmental benefits have continued to be released. The total amount of pollutants emitted in the region has been reduced, which has laid the foundation for continuous improvement in air quality.
Beijing officially released and implemented the "Beijing Clean Air Action Plan 2013-2017" in 2013.
According to the plan, the official continued to guide the non-capital function, promote energy clean substitution and pollution reduction, and eliminate 4,923 coal-fired boilers.
Beijing has thus become the first big city in mainland China to realize the natural gas of the whole network.
The data shows that between 2013 and 2017, the average annual concentration of PM2.5 in Beijing decreased by 35.6%; the number of air quality compliance days increased by 50 days; the number of first-class excellent days increased by 25 days; the number of heavy pollution days decreased by 35 days, and the incidence of heavy pollution decreased significantly.
While the air quality continues to improve, Beijing officials, based on a new round of PM2.5 source analysis, released the "Three-Year Action Plan for Beijing to Win the Blue Sky Defense Battle" in September this year, focusing on diesel trucks, dust, volatile organic compounds, etc. Key prevention and control areas, optimize the adjustment of transportation structure, industrial structure, energy structure and land use structure, strengthen regional joint prevention and control, focus on strengthening the city's refined management, comprehensively promote green development, and strive to make the "bluest sky" resident in Beijing, "no longer return to its background.
During the National Day Golden Week this year, the relevant departments of the Municipal Tourism Commission, industry and commerce, urban management, and public security will strengthen the law enforcement inspection of the "one-day tour" market, focusing on the "six black" chaos of tourism. Once the illegal offenders are verified, they will be given strict and strict punishment according to law.
Yesterday morning, the municipal government held a special meeting to crack down on illegal "day trips" and deployed special operations to further crack down on illegal "day trips."
At the meeting, it was revealed that the focus on the "six black" chaos of black ticket mention, black guide, black club, black car, black shop, black network interest chain is intertwined. The city has launched a crackdown on illegal "day trip" since July 28. Special action.
Since the launch of the special operation, the city has accepted 39 complaints of "one day trip," down 63% year-on-year; this year, the city has accepted 270 complaints of "one day trip," down 62% year-on-year.
In the past two months, the city has seized 248 "black cars," investigated and dealt with 158 violations of tourist passenger transport business, closed 29 shopping "black shops" and entertainment venues, investigated and dealt with 13 "black clubs" and "black guides." 27 people, confiscated 26,000 illegal advertisements, dismantled 31 illegal "day trip" billboards, 3 bus fake stop signs, investigated and dealt with 1789 violations of various types of travel-related violations, and 181 functional departments filed a fine of 4.48 million yuan, and detained 111 illegal personnel.
After rectification, the illegal "one-day tour" chaos was basically contained, and the "one-day tour" market order showed a stable and good situation.
According to reports, in recent years, the city has continuously increased the rectification of illegal "day trips."
In 2016 and 2017, the Municipal Tourism Commission accepted 1612 and 897 complaints of "day trips," a decrease of 79% and 44% respectively. However, illegal "day trips" still continue to play, often rebound, and formed a black ticket, black guide, black club, black car, black shop, black net and other interest chains intertwined "six black" chaos.
Specifically, the street illegal passengers are "black ticket mention," the illegal website that publishes false travel information is "black network," the travel agency engaged in illegal "day trip" or the agency or individual without travel agency business qualifications is "black club," "black club" The tour guide employed by the "black club" is "black guide," and the vehicles that use no tourist passenger transport qualifications or provide passenger transport services for illegal "day trip" are "black car," they will eventually bring into the shop. "
In this special operation, the city continued to increase the fixed inspection and mobile inspection of illegal "one-day tour." In response to the high incidence of illegal "one-day tour" and the high impact of tourist routes, the relevant departments sent unannounced visits to the group every day. After the unannounced visit, the evidence of illegal and illegal activities was strictly investigated and dealt with according to law.
Among them, "black car" and "black shop" have become the focus of two strikes in the special operation.
According to reports, without black cars, illegal "day trips" cannot be made. Black cars are easy to be discovered, remembered and investigated, and are also fixed assets with higher individual value.
Relevant departments use road traffic monitoring probes to increase the supervision of key "day trip" tour buses, and use technical defense, material defense and other scientific and technological intelligence means to find and investigate "black cars" in a timely manner.
Travel shopping "black shop" has also become the focus of the crackdown due to the small number and the operation of the place.
In order to strengthen the deterrent and crackdown on illegal "day trips," all functional departments will be given strict and strict punishment according to law once the violations are verified.
In August this year, the city also held a seminar on legal issues related to the crackdown on illegal "day trips," and discussed the means and measures for combining administrative punishment with conviction.
The Municipal Tourism Commission said that in the future, more regular travel agencies will be encouraged to carry out "day trips" in Beijing, and the supply of regular "day trips" will be increased to further occupy the living space of illegal "day trips." The specific plan is still under study.
In addition, the Municipal Tourism Commission has continuously improved the tour group electronic itinerary information system to ensure that each team is included in the electronic itinerary platform supervision.
From a tourist symbol to a digital economic symbol, what has Wuzhen experienced in these years
As the permanent venue of the World Internet Conference, Wuzhen has received much attention on how to undertake the dividends of the summit.
Since the first World Internet Conference, in the past five years, the changes in Wuzhen have been obvious to all.
In 2014, there were only 12 companies related to the digital economy and the Internet in the town. By the third quarter of this year, there were more than 500.
This is a microcosm of the development of the digital economy in Wuzhen.
The convening of the Internet Conference has enabled local enterprises to accept the enlightenment of the digital economy and the digital wave from a distance. The desire for enterprise transformation and upgrading is very strong. Traditional manufacturing enterprises have increased their investment and research and development in machine replacement and intelligent management.
Jiang Wei, secretary of the Wuzhen Town Party Committee, said that Wuzhen will build a new economic empowerment center in the future.
The development of the digital economy cannot be separated from the support of infrastructure.
This year, Wuzhen launched a 5G pilot project on the basis of achieving full coverage of 4G communication networks and free WiFi.
At the same time, Tongxiang City, where Wuzhen is located, as the first county-level city in the country to build a dedicated channel for international Internet data, has also become a hot spot for the development of the Internet industry.
Since the first World Internet Conference, Tongxiang has introduced 565 digital economy projects with a total planned investment of 37.725 billion yuan. In the first three quarters of this year, the core manufacturing industry of the digital economy achieved a total output value of 8.73 billion yuan, and the added value increased by 13% year-on-year.
"Wuzhen was a tourist symbol before, and later there were more drama and cultural symbols. Because of the Internet conference, it has now become an Internet and digital economic symbol."
Sheng Yongjun, secretary of the Tongxiang Municipal Party Committee, believes that the dividends of the World Internet Conference will accumulate over time. Therefore, it is also necessary to build a platform to undertake the superposition of talents, projects, technologies and other elements.
Shen Yi, a native of Tongxiang, has been working outside for 20 years. Because of his connection with the Internet conference, he returned home to start a business.
On December 2 last year, he entered the 4th Internet Light Expo with a high-capacity anti-tampering digital technology solution and was favored by many customers.
Shen Yi chose to start a business in Wuzhen not only because of his hometown complex. "In Wuzhen, it is easier to recruit people than I thought. Our application is also very fast. There are our applications in the Wuzhen Smart Parking Project."
A Wuzhen Avenue presents the spillover effect of the Internet conference.
This road that runs through the north and south of Tongxiang is not only a tourist attraction, but also an industrial road.
Relying on it, Wuzhen Avenue Kechuang agglomeration area came into being.
The reporter learned that in the future, Wuzhen Avenue will become the main position of Tongxiang's industrial development, taking the lead in applying a large number of achievements such as smart medical care, smart pension, and smart government affairs, gathering 80% of the city's GDP and many high-level talents.
Tsunami caused by strong earthquake in Indonesia has killed at least 410 people
According to the Indonesian Jakarta Police Public Information Bureau on the evening of the 29th, the current earthquake in Central Sulawesi Province has caused 410 deaths, of which 97 were confirmed.
Another 29 people were missing and 540 were injured.
Palu Airport is still closed.
Active treatment, the survival rate of premature infants aged 29 weeks and above in China reached 98%, which has reached the level of developed countries.
Zhongxin.com, Shanghai, September 30 (Chen Jing Luo Yanqian) National Children's Medical Center and Fudan University Affiliated Pediatric Hospital disclosed on the 30th that they introduced Canada's advanced methods in the leading "China NICU Hospitalized Premature Infant Prognosis Quality Improvement Project."
The results of the project show that after active treatment, the survival rate of premature infants aged 29 weeks and above in China has reached 98%, which has reached the level of developed countries, but there is still much room for improvement in the survival rate of premature infants and premature infants with minimal gestational age.
In the past 20 years, the Chinese government has been paying attention to the treatment of newborns.
At present, the infant mortality rate in Shanghai has dropped to 3.71 per thousand, which is significantly lower than the national average and reaches the advanced level of developed countries.
The "China NICU Hospitalized Premature Infants Prognosis Quality Improvement Project" has greatly improved the quality of life of premature infants through four years of unremitting efforts.
Professor Cao Yun, director of the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of the Affiliated Pediatric Hospital of Fudan University, told reporters that while improving the survival rate of premature infants, attention is paid to reducing the survival quality of premature infants, reducing the incidence of complications, improving the prognosis of neurodevelopment, and improving the overall outcome of children. It is of great significance to improve the overall quality of life and population quality of premature infants. It is an important issue of concern in the pediatric and neonatal circles at home and abroad. It is also a key issue of concern for this project.
The "China NICU Hospitalized Premature Infants Prognosis Quality Improvement Project" has made unremitting efforts over the past four years to include tens of thousands of premature infants with a gestational age of 33 weeks and below, which has reduced the mortality rate of premature infants and small birth weight premature infants in China by 1 / 3. At the same time, the incidence of serious complications in premature infants has dropped significantly, greatly improving the quality of life of premature infants.
Through the establishment of a national newborn quality improvement cooperation network and the introduction of collaborative quality improvement concepts, the project radiates 25 collaborative hospitals across China, and establishes a set of collaborative methods suitable for domestic conditions to improve the prognosis of premature infants and improve the level of neonatal treatment. Complete, systematic and effective collaborative quality improvement methods.
The Pediatric Hospital affiliated to Fudan University is working with the National Neonatology Department to develop guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections based on the accumulated experience of the project, and to provide reference and guidance for the standardized diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections in China.
It is understood that in the "China Premature Baby Prognosis Quality Improvement Project," the pediatric hospital introduced the EPIQ method to 25 large NICUs in 19 provinces across the country, which is committed to solving the problem of premature infant infection that plagues China's neonatal care unit.
After more than 10 years of continuous improvement, the survival rate of premature infants in Canada has increased by about 1 / 3. Canada is now one of the countries with the best prognosis of premature infants in the world.
The EPIQ method has been applied to all NICUs in Canada and has been adopted by six countries.
According to the pediatric hospital, the results of the study showed that after two years of EPIQ intervention, the infection of premature infants decreased by 35%, while the use of antibiotics decreased by 20%.
In the future, the Pediatric Hospital affiliated to Fudan University will continue to promote and implement this method nationwide, with a view to comprehensively reducing the incidence of all complications of premature infants and improving the quality of treatment of newborns nationwide.
At present, it is an indisputable fact that the level of treatment in various regions of China is different and uneven.
According to Professor Cao Yun, as an important construction unit of the National Children's Medical Center, the pediatric hospital will play a leading role in radiation. This study covers many western provinces such as Xinjiang, Guizhou, Gansu and Shaanxi, with a view to gradually promoting the homogenization and standardization of neonatal treatment nationwide.
It is understood that the Pediatric Hospital affiliated to Fudan University is working with the National Neonatology Department to develop guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections based on the accumulated experience of the project, and to provide reference and guidance for the standardized diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections in China.
According to reports, in 2019, the coordination center is located in the China Neonatal Cooperation Network of the Affiliated Pediatric Hospital of Fudan University. It will unite 63 hospitals across the country to carry out the next phase of national quality improvement, with a view to promoting the homogenization of the level of neonatal treatment in China.
Yu Jinglei, director of the Shanghai Municipal Health and Family Planning Commission, said that Shanghai can become a central city in Asia, not only in research, but also in the construction of the entire service system. The quality of service and service results should have a place in Asia, thus truly reflecting China's medical level.
Xin Liping: Build the "Hero Monument" in the heart - written on the fifth martyr anniversary.
On September 30th, on the eve of the 69th birthday of the Republic, we ushered in the fifth anniversary of the martyrs. Xi Jinping and other party and state leaders came to Tiananmen Square to attend the flower basket ceremony for the people's heroes.
At this moment, no matter where you are, please pay tribute to Yinglie.
Memorial Day, is to relive, but also wake up.
Open the heavy history, behind the name of each martyr, is a living life.
They also have hot youth, sincere love, and family members who are concerned.
However, because they firmly believe that "the doctrine of our faith is the truth of the universe," in order to "forgive the suffering of the next generation," they are willing to sacrifice everything they have.
"I will shout for China one day to survive."
Through time and space, the heroes set up a spiritual road sign to guide the direction of moving forward.
"Where to come from, where to go" "What kind of person to be," read Yinglie, it is not difficult to get the answer.
To commemorate Yinglie, the most important thing is to build a "hero monument" in the heart.
According to incomplete statistics, since the revolutionary war years, about 20 million martyrs have dedicated themselves to national independence, people's liberation, and national prosperity.
For various reasons, many martyrs did not even leave their names.
Countless heroes water their ideals with blood, practice their beliefs with life, remember their English names, and inherit their spirit, which is to protect the roots and souls of the nation.
This "hero monument" does not allow any defilement and destruction.
For some time, the undercurrent of historical nihilism and pan-entertainment has surged.
All kinds of practices that distort history and detract from the heroic, challenge the conscience of justice, misjudge the value, and arouse the public anger and vigilance of the whole society.
Yinglie is not allowed to blaspheme, and heroes cannot forget.
The act of touching the bottom line cannot be left unattended. It must dare to shine the sword and defend the heroic dignity with the rule of law and justice.
On May 1 this year, the Hero Martyrs Protection Law was officially implemented.
From the perspective of judicial practice, the judgments of some cases are very gratifying, not only effectively maintaining the glorious image of the heroic spirit according to law, but also releasing the positive energy of advocating heroes and respecting the martyrs.
A pursuing nation cannot have no heroes, and a country with ideals cannot have no pioneers.
Remembering the martyrs and calling for heroes has become a universal social consensus.
At present, there are millions of commemorative facilities in the country, and more than 100 million people visit the Martyrs Cemetery every year.
The heart is the strongest cornerstone.
Let the heroes, defend the heroes, learn the heroes, and care for the heroes become commonplace, and let the heroic spirit integrate into the national blood. A "hero monument" will stand between heaven and earth and the depths of the heart.
Reuters, Brussels, September 28 - After Italy flouted the EU's demands and surprised the market with a large budget deficit plan, the EU took a non-confrontational stance against Italy on Friday, but if Italy insists on too bold a goal, the EU may take a more radical stance.
The Italian government's goal is to have a budget deficit equivalent to 2.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) in the next three years, indicating that there is no debt reduction in the face of deficit reduction requirements.
EU Executive Committee on Economic Affairs Executive Committee Moskevisi said on Friday, "We have no interest in the crisis between the Executive Committee and Italy." Since the EU's recommendations and sanctions may have little impact on Italy, he took a cautious response.
EU officials and diplomats still hope that market forces will be able to persuade Italy to adjust its budget plan before Italy is officially submitted to the EU Executive Committee in mid-October.
After the government announced its plan, the euro fell to its lowest level in nearly two weeks on Friday, while Italian bond yields hit their highest level in three weeks.
If the deficit target remains unchanged before the October deadline, the EU Executive Committee may veto Italy's draft budget, which is something the Executive Committee has never done to any country.
Dongbrovsky, vice chairman of the EU Executive Committee, said at a meeting in Riga, Latvia, on Friday that Italy's current fiscal plan "seems to be inconsistent with the stability and growth pact," referring to the EU's financial regulations.
But he did not say how this would trigger the EU's response.
Bidders can submit an application to participate in the public tender before October 26 this year.
Previously, the Russian Ministry of Agriculture regarded China as one of the priority markets for Russian agricultural exports.
The Russian Agricultural Supervision Bureau announced in May that Russia's grain exports to China exceeded 1 million tons for the first time in this agricultural year, a record.
The bureau predicts that China may enter the top ten Russian food importers.
ZXS Sapporo, September 30th, following the 3: 0 victory over Cuba in the first game, the Chinese women's volleyball team once again defeated the Turkish team 3: 0 on the 30th, and won two consecutive victories in the group stage of the 2018 World Championships.
However, compared with the first battle, the Chinese women's volleyball team is more difficult.
There are 24 teams participating in the 2018 Women's Volleyball World Championships. The Chinese women's volleyball team is in Group B with Italy, Turkey, Bulgaria, Canada and Cuba.
From the world rankings and overall strength of the teams in Group B, the Turkish team and the Italian team are the main opponents of the Chinese team.
After the start of the day, the Chinese team entered the state quickly, took the lead at the start, maintained the advantage throughout, put a lot of pressure on the opponent on the serve and block, and won the first game more smoothly at 25: 18.
In the second game, the Turkish team's serve was very fierce. After the start of the game, the Chinese team took a 6: 2 lead. After the suspension, the Chinese team adjusted the formation, gradually chased the score to 7, and then repeatedly blocked the score. The score was 7: 0; at the end of the game, the Turkish team chased the score to 15: 19; after the Chinese team got the game point at 24: 20, the tenacious Turkish team scored 2 points again. After the Chinese team requested a suspension, Zhu Ting scored in the second game: 23.
The situation in the third game was very glued, and the scores of the two sides rose alternately, once tied at 19.
At the crucial moment, the Turkish team made a mistake. After the Chinese team took the lead at 21: 19, they won the match point at 24: 21 with Jutting's strong deduction and Zhang Changning's attack; then the Turkish team chased the score to 23: 24. After the Chinese team requested a suspension, Zhang Changning scored on the attack and the Chinese team locked the victory at 25: 23.
Lang Ping, head coach of the Chinese Women's Volleyball Team, admitted after the game that the whole game was not easy.
"We are well prepared, the block is good, the Turkish team is more comprehensive, we must reduce mistakes, and strive to win through their own initiative."

The national non-film cotton on-site observation and discussion exchange experts walked into the test field and listened to the introduction of the representative of the Chinese Academy of Engineering Yu Shuxun team.
Xinhuanet Xinjiang Shaya September 30th (Geng Dandan Wang Xiaojun) is located in the non-film cotton planting test base in Shaya County, Xinjiang. The non-film cotton is growing happily, compared with the mulch cotton next to it. "No less," a cluster of snow-white cotton is competing to "open," hanging full of branches.
From September 27th to 28th, the national non-film cotton on-site observation and discussion exchange activities were held in Shaya County, Xinjiang.
The reporter learned at the observation meeting that the film-free cotton technology system with "China Cotton 619" and its supporting cultivation measures as the main body has initially achieved the goal of film-free planting in cotton fields, reducing the residual film of cotton fields in Xinjiang. Pollution of ecological environment and raw cotton, research and demonstration of film-free cotton comprehensive technology has made significant progress.
Academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, famous cotton genetic breeder, and chief scientist of the national modern agricultural industry technology system, Academician Yu Shuxun, introduced the growth of non-film cotton to Zhou Guomao, secretary of the Party Committee of Zhejiang Agricultural and Forestry University.
"The film-free cotton comprehensive technology we developed can fully realize the planting of cotton without mulch, which can completely solve the problem of residual film pollution and achieve green cotton planting."
Yu Shuxun, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.
Xinjiang is the most important cotton-producing area in China. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the cotton planting area in Xinjiang in 2017 was 35 million mu, accounting for 61% of the country's cotton area.
Since the introduction of mulch into China in 1982, the area covered by various crops in Xinjiang has reached more than 50 million mu, and the annual use of mulch is about 300,000 tons.
Among them, the cotton mulching rate reached 100%, and cotton field mulching accounted for about 60% of the use of mulching in Xinjiang.
The production of non-coated cotton is measured, and the output of cotton can be fully realized from 320 kg to 350 kg.
With the increasing amount of mulch input in Xinjiang, the recovery rate of residual mulch is low, the amount of residual film in the soil is gradually increasing, and the residual film causes a series of problems such as soil structure destruction, which seriously affects the sustainable development of agriculture.
The residual film not only causes serious pollution to the soil, but also has a great impact on the quality of cotton fiber.
At present, more than 1 / 3 of the cotton fields in Xinjiang have achieved mechanized harvesting.
In 2017, the area of cotton mining in Xinjiang is about 14 million mu.
In the process of harvesting cotton, a large amount of broken film on the surface and cotton plants is collected. The broken film doped in the raw cotton is difficult to remove during the processing of raw cotton. It cannot be completely removed during the subsequent textile processing, which seriously affects the quality of textile products.
On September 28th, the national non-film cotton on-site observation and discussion exchange activities were held in Shaya County, Xinjiang.
In order to focus on solving the pollution of mulch in cotton fields, simplifying cotton planting technology, and improving the efficiency of cotton fields, Yu Shuxun led his team to implement the "China Cotton 619" non-film cotton technology planting through 8 years, for Xinjiang. Agricultural green development "add wings."
Yu Shuxun introduced that through innovative breeding new ideas, a new line of land-based cotton "Chinese cotton 619" with early maturity, salt-tolerant, low temperature-resistant and high yield was cultivated.
"Under the conditions of non-membrane cultivation in southern Xinjiang, the" China Cotton 619 "has achieved a series of supporting measures such as film-free seeding machinery, deep seeding improvement, shallow burying of drip belts under film-free conditions, suitable planting density screening, and reasonable chemical regulation."
At present, Aksu, Kurle, Arar and other places have established a demonstration base of non-coated cotton, with a yield of 4,800 kilograms per hectare.
Membrane-free planting of cotton, to achieve high yield, cost-saving, environmental protection, comprehensive benefits.
Zhang Donghai, an agronomist at the Agricultural Research Institute of the Third Division of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, said that through the research and demonstration of non-coated cotton cultivation techniques in the past six years, the production of non-coated cottonseed cotton can fully achieve a yield of 320 kg to 350 kg, or even higher.
"The promotion of non-coated cotton cultivation technology has great prospects."
Zhang Donghai believes that at present, the cultivation technology of non-coated cotton can completely solve the problem of soil residual film pollution, but there is still a certain gap in economic benefits compared with mulch cultivation.
"The support of cotton purchase price will be conducive to future promotion."
Yu Shuxun said that in the next step, he and his team will continue to conduct in-depth research and large-scale application of non-coated cotton, make the industry of non-coated cotton bigger and stronger, and completely solve the problem of soil pollution caused by mulching.

"Where can I take a taxi?
We want to go to the Golden Bauhinia Square to see the National Day flag-raising ceremony! "
The Song couple who flew from Ningxia to Shenzhen and transferred to the first bus of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong high-speed railway National Day in Shenzhen were interviewed by the China News Agency at the West Kowloon Station in Hong Kong on the morning of October 1.
On the morning of October 1, in celebration of the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government held a grand flag-raising ceremony at the Golden Bauhinia Square.
According to statistics from immigration control points, as of September 30, the number of passengers entering Hong Kong through the West Kowloon Station of the High Speed Rail has exceeded 300,000.
On the occasion of the 69th anniversary of the motherland, the West Kowloon Border Inspection Station predicts that there will be a peak of passenger visits to Hong Kong on October 1 and 2.
The reporter saw at the arrival hall at 7 o'clock on the morning of the 1st that many mainland tourists took advantage of the National Day Golden Week to take the high-speed rail and visit Hong Kong.
Mrs. Song, who is brisk in her footsteps, told reporters that the National Day holiday is a rare holiday in a year. It is her wish to come to Hong Kong's Golden Bauhinia Square to see the flag raised. I feel particularly happy and excited to reach this wish on the National Day.
However, the current flight from Ningxia to Hong Kong is inconvenient. Fortunately, the Hong Kong section of the high-speed rail is open to traffic. After inquiring about the train schedule, Mr. Song found that the first bus can arrive at 7: 3 am, connecting the city to the Golden Bauhinia Square. The time is just right.
He lamented with the reporter: "The high-speed rail is really too convenient, fast and accurate!"
Daily short-distance trains between Guangzhou South, Shenzhen North and Futian and West Kowloon within 70 hours, which greatly facilitated the arrival of residents in the Dawan area of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao.
After Mr. Liu, who lives in Shenzhen, arrived in Hong Kong, he was preparing to go to the Hong Kong friends of the Central Peak.
Mr. Liu said: "The Mainland and Hong Kong are on holiday on the National Day. We intend to challenge ourselves to see if we can complete the 50-kilometer Hong Kong Island Trail!"
He explained that if the high-speed rail is not opened, the traffic is convenient, and the time is sufficient, they dare not easily try such a long-distance mountain trip.
Mrs. Yang from Dongguan took her 10-year-old son to Hong Kong to participate in the piano competition by high-speed rail. She proudly told reporters that her son has been studying the piano for three years. It is very meaningful to spend the National Day in this way.
She has been taking a bus to Hong Kong before, but it is time-consuming and labor-intensive. She is worried about affecting her son's status. This time, she came by Shenzhen by high-speed rail. The customs clearance is convenient and the time is halved. The journey of the Hong Kong section is even more impressive. She said to the reporter: "It seems to take the subway, especially fast, I have not had time to take pictures!"
At 6: 44 on September 23, the G5711 "Harmony" high-speed train set off from Shenzhen North Railway Station and galloped all the way. After a few minutes, the train entered the Hong Kong section of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong high-speed railway. This is the first officially operated high-speed train ushered in by the Hong Kong section.
The Hong Kong section of the high-speed rail network, which is integrated into the country's 25,000-kilometer high-speed rail network and goes directly to 38 long-distance stations across the country, also welcomes mainland passengers from different provinces in the south and north of the country.
Mr. Gao, who came to visit relatives from Changsha on a long holiday, told reporters that the high-speed rail could only sit in the north of Shenzhen, take the subway to cross Hong Kong and then transfer to the city. The transfer is troublesome and time-consuming. Now sit directly in the Kowloon Center and get home. You can eat the lunch made by the child and feel very happy.
He said that the convenience of the "one place, two inspections" customs clearance process is beyond imagination. "Less than 10 minutes, both customs have passed."
The West Kowloon Station, which is close to the Airport Express and connects land and air traffic, has also become the first choice for many transit passengers.
Miss Wu from Fujian is preparing to spend the Golden Week with her girlfriends from Hong Kong to the Philippines. She is pushing her luggage on the spot in West Kowloon. She is not afraid to catch up with the plane. I didn't expect it to be so fast. More than enough time! "
According to the subsidiary arrangement of the trade agreement announced on Monday, the new US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement will retain US President Trump's ability to implement a 25% tariff threat on imported cars, while at the same time making passenger cars, pickups and auto parts imported from Canada and Mexico basically exempt from paying tariffs.
If Trump imposes a so-called "232 chapter" tariff on cars for national security reasons, both Mexico and Canada will have a quota of 2.6 million passenger cars that are exempt from tax each year.
According to the subsidiary arrangement, the pickup trucks produced in the two countries will be completely exempted from tariffs.
If Trump imposes auto tariffs, Mexico will receive an annual tax exemption for $108 billion in auto parts, and Canada will receive a $32.4 billion quota.
Both quotas are much higher than the existing production levels of the two countries, providing room for growth for exports from both countries.
Reuters Washington / Mexico September 28 - Mexico said on Friday that after several days of debate, US President Trump's government and Canada are making practical efforts to resolve trade policy differences, making the outside world look forward to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is expected to maintain the tripartite agreement.
Although there is a lack of details, the above obvious progress is enough to prompt the Mexican and US governments to suddenly stop the plan to publish the text of the two-party trade agreement and give Canada more time to join the agreement.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told reporters in Mexico that the US government has made new counter-proposals to the Canadian government and said that he will continue to urge all three countries to participate in NAFTA.
Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said that the time to submit the text of the US-Mexico trade agreement to Mexican and US legislation was postponed because the Canadian and US governments "very seriously" tried to reach an agreement.
Guajardo said, "In the next 48 hours, we will know whether we have reached a text of a tripartite agreement or have to publish the text of the two-party agreement."
Guajardo said that his US and Canadian counterparts "specifically requested" to postpone the release of the text.
A spokesman for the US Trade Representative Office (USTR) did not comment on the text of the US-Mexico trade agreement and the consultations between the United States and Canada.
Officials from the Office of the Prime Minister of Canada and the Office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs did not respond to a request for comment on the counter-proposal.
According to foreign media reports, in a conservation center on the outskirts of Pretoria, South Africa, two lions play together, it is difficult to see any abnormalities, but they are unique.
The University of Pretoria announced: "This is the first young lion born in artificial insemination - the first pair in the world."
Scientists in the school are working to study the reproductive system of female African lions.
Gans Winter, director of the Institute of Mammal Research at the University of Pretoria, said that the two cubs born on August 25 are quite healthy and normal.
After 18 months of intensive testing, his team finally reached this breakthrough.
In an interview with the media, Ganswint said: "We collect sperm from a healthy lion."
Next, the researchers artificially inseminated the lioness when the hormone content in the lioness reached the appropriate level.
Ganswind said: "Fortunately, the result is successful."
He said that the researchers "made several attempts, but unexpectedly, did not spend too much effort."
He said that the above-mentioned research breakthroughs can be verified repeatedly, and scientists hope to use this technology to save endangered large cats.
The International Union for Conservation of Nature pointed out that lions have become extinct in 26 countries in Africa, and the total number of surviving wild lions has dropped by 43% in the past 20 years, leaving only 20,000.
The African lion is listed as a vulnerable animal by this organization.
Gansvint said: "If we don't do something for this animal, they will face extinction."
He said that this new technology does not require lions to be reared, but simply injects sperm into a pregnant lioness, just as North America and Europe do with captive elephants.
South Korea's exports fell by the most in more than two years in September, but analysts blamed the decline on fewer working days and said that despite rising trade tensions between China and the United States, global demand for Korean goods is still strong.
Indeed, South Korea's average daily exports increased last month.
In addition, the initial data released earlier showed double-digit growth in exports in the first few weeks of September before the long holiday.
South Korea's September exports fell by the largest year-on-year since July 2016, and the decline was greater than the 5.7% decline in the estimates of 11 analysts surveyed by Reuters.
The initial value released on Monday showed that exports in September were $50.6 billion, down from $51.2 billion in August.
Although the growing US-China trade dispute may cause other export-dependent Chinese neighbors to suffer, South Korea's exports to China grew by 7.8% in September, expanding for the 23rd consecutive month.
South Korea's exports to the United States fell by 11.8%, as oil product sales fell.
Overseas sales of Korean memory chips and petroleum products increased by 28.3% and 13.5% respectively, although the market is worried that the so-called chip "super cycle" may have peaked.
"However, the impact of trade conflicts will be difficult to avoid, because South Korea's exports depend to a considerable extent on the US and Chinese markets."
Imports fell 2.1% to $40.8 billion, which is not as good as the Reuters survey estimate of 3.1%.
The initial trade surplus in September was $9.7 billion, up from $6.9 billion in August.
The Ministry of Industry said that thanks to the United States and EU countries, the global manufacturing industry will remain prosperous, which is a favorable factor for South Korean exports.
The statement pointed out that "the increase in export prices caused by rising oil prices will also be beneficial to exports in the second half of this year."
"However, the continuation of the trade conflict between the United States and China, coupled with the increase in market volatility after the US interest rate hike, is a negative pressure on exports."
The average export per working day in September increased to $2.6 billion, compared with $2.1 billion in August.
South Korea's Mid-Autumn Festival fell on September 24-26 this year, so there were only 19.5 working days in September, four days less than the same period last year.
South Korea's exports from January to September increased by 4.7% compared with the same period last year.
According to the Nikkei / Markit Purchasing Managers Index, South Korean manufacturing activity rebounded in September, but was supported by domestic orders, as orders from China and Japan fell, which threatened to overshadow another export outlook.
North Korean media criticized the United States for not relaxing sanctions against the DPRK
North Korea's "Labor News" published a signed commentary on September 30, criticizing the United States for seeking dialogue with the DPRK while not relaxing sanctions against the DPRK, saying that this is a "contradictory" approach.
The article said that US Secretary of State Pompeo said on the 14th that "in order to realize the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, the key is to implement sanctions against the DPRK," emphasizing that the United States continues to implement the UN sanctions resolution. The position remains unchanged.
In the Singapore DPRK-US Joint Statement, the two sides promised to establish a new DPRK-US relationship that is compatible with the desire of the DPRK and the United States to look forward to peace and prosperity.
The United States has increased the intensity of sanctions and pressure, while demanding dialogue. This practice is undoubtedly contradictory.
The article said that if we want to establish a new DPRK-US relationship, build a permanently consolidated peace system on the Korean Peninsula, and achieve complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, we should put building trust in the first place, starting with what can be done, and solve it one by one.
The article also said that the United States should understand that sanctions and suppression are not feasible for North Korea.
The article said that even the "North Devonsk" before the "Kazan" also made the US military admire.
"National Interest" magazine quoted the US Navy as saying: "We will encounter strong potential opponents. It is enough to look at the North Devonsk submarine."
The current commander-in-chief of the US Navy in Europe, Fogo, also praised the "North Devonsk" submarine.
He said: "This submarine is impressive. If you look at the development of the Russian navy and how to use resources, you will know that its main efforts in research and development are first and foremost to strengthen the submarine fleet."
However, "National Interest" magazine still believes that the United States maintains an advantage over Russia in this field.
Fogo said: "I believe that Western countries still have asymmetric advantages."
Earlier, it was reported that the Russian Navy will install the "Kazan" submarine in 2019.
"Kazan," "Novosibirsk," "Krasnoyarsk" and "Arkhangelsk" multi-purpose submarines are all "White Wax Tree-M" improved, with a displacement of 13,800 tons and a dive depth of 520 meters. 64 people, 31 knots of underwater speed, will carry mines, torpedoes and "caliber" and "onyx" cruise missiles.

Ignore the American threat!
EU may reach a crude oil procurement agreement with Iran
The US government recently announced that it will restart a new round of sanctions against Iran in November and even urge other countries to reduce imports of Iranian oil.
However, the US allies did not seem to listen.
According to the US "New York Times" report, on the 29th, Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif revealed that although the United States threatened to sanction any country doing business with Iran, Tehran is close to reaching an agreement with the European Union on the sale of crude oil.
The core purpose of this agreement is to try to establish a new payment mechanism, that is, to replace US dollar transactions with barter or local currency pricing.
The purpose of this method is to bypass the United States and prevent the United States from obstructing financial transfers.
At the same time, although the EU is committed to the promotion of the agreement, some French and British officials are also worried. If the agreement is realized, this will be the most open confrontation between the EU and the United States against the US withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear agreement.
The US media said that in an hour-long interview, Zarif's words sounded more optimistic than in recent months.
Because the agreement has the ability to "divest" the traditional allies of the United States, effectively breaking the US attempt to cut Iran's income.
"This will ensure that we sell oil and benefit," Zarif believes that according to the agreement reached in 2015, countries have the legal right to trade with Iran.
EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini also said recently that "no sovereign state or organization can accept others to decide who they can trade with."
However, she also predicted that before the US government launched the next sanctions in November, US leaders may adopt a series of financial measures aimed at banks, businessmen and countries that have business dealings with Tehran.
In May of this year, the US government unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear agreement on the grounds that the agreement was flawed, and said that the agreement could not permanently ban Iran from producing nuclear fuel.
The US subsequently threatened to ban companies that buy Iranian oil and other goods from doing business in the United States.
This threat caused some companies to withdraw from Tehran and the Iranian currency plummeted.
Companies such as Airbus and French oil giant Total have cancelled billions of dollars in investment in Iraq.
British and French officials have said that the US government may "prevail."
Sure enough, according to a recent report in the Turkish media, the US sanctions do not seem to have had a great impact on Iran's oil exports.
Iranian Oil Minister Zangane recently revealed that no other country except South Korea has stopped buying Iranian oil.
Zarif and Iranian President Rouhani both believe that the purpose of a series of US actions is to "tempt" Iran to violate the agreement.
Zarif also disdained a series of verbal attacks by the US. When asked if the United States would overthrow the current Iranian government with increasing financial pressure, Zarif even laughed. "It is a strategy of regime change. This is the true purpose of the US."

The reporter learned from the National Health Committee that compared with decades ago, the incidence of malnutrition among children and adolescents in China has declined, and the incidence of overweight and obesity has increased significantly.
Experts pointed out that to maintain a healthy weight, the most important concept is to "cure the disease" and vigorously promote scientific fitness and reasonable diet.
According to the "Core Information and Interpretation of China's Youth Health Education (2018 Edition)" recently released by the National Health Committee, the key to maintaining a healthy weight is reasonable diet and scientific exercise.
Overweight, obesity and blind weight loss are not conducive to health.
The health hidden dangers behind "Little Fat Dun" cannot be ignored.
Ding Gangqiang, director of the Institute of Nutrition and Health of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said that overweight obesity harms the normal growth and development of adolescents and has adverse effects on their psychology, behavior, cognition and intelligence, and even leads to high blood pressure, high blood sugar and high blood lipids in children.
At the same time, overweight obesity in adolescents is likely to continue into adulthood, which will increase the risk of chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes in adolescents.
Ding Gangqiang said that from 2010 to 2012, the nutrition and health status of Chinese residents showed that the overweight rate of children aged 6-17 in China was 9.6%, and the obesity rate was 6.4%, which was added to 16%.
At the same time, the overweight obesity of children and adolescents is higher than that of girls, and the city is higher than that of rural areas. The rate of overweight obesity has increased significantly in recent decades.
How do teenagers deal with overweight and obesity?
Zhang Wei, deputy director of the Scientific Fitness and Health Promotion Research Center of the State Sports General Administration, pointed out that the main reason for adolescent obesity is excessive calorie intake and insufficient physical activity.
For this simple obesity, we should pay attention to scientific exercise and reasonable dietary control.
Zhang Wei pointed out that the most important concept for maintaining a healthy weight is "cure the disease." A very important part of it is to carry out comprehensive science education for schools, parents and students, popularize the dangers of overweight and obesity, and improve the awareness of young people.
Adolescents should have regular physical examinations, monitor growth and development indicators such as height and weight, and early detection and scientific judgment of overweight and obesity in order to take timely interventions.
For adolescents who are already overweight and obese, Ding Gangqiang suggested that in addition to actively and scientifically arranging meals and exercise, adolescents are in a special physiological stage, and should avoid using hunger or semi-hunger therapy to control and lose weight. Do not blindly take weight loss drugs.
Reuters, September 28 - Facebook (FB.O) said on Friday that hackers stole digital login codes, giving them nearly 50 million user accounts, which is unprecedented and is the most serious security vulnerability in its history.

ZXS Yichang, October 1 (Guo Xiaoying Liu Min) The newly revised "Regulations on Navigation and Dispatching of the Three Gorges-Gezhouba Water Conservancy Project" (hereinafter referred to as "Dispatching Regulations") was officially implemented on October 1. After two years of trial navigation, the Three Gorges ship lift was officially dispatched in a unified manner with the ship lock.
On the first day of the implementation of the new regulations, the navigation order of the Three Gorges-Gezhouba waters was good.
The Yangtze River Three Gorges Navigation Administration issued the first security inspection plan at 21: 00 on September 30, and conducted security inspections on 160 ships. A total of 124 ships passed the security inspection.
At 14: 00 on October 1, the navigation department arranged the first crossing plan after the implementation of the new regulations.
After the implementation of the new regulations, the security plan will be released once a day at 9: 00 and 21: 00, and the dam plan will be released once a day at 14: 00 and 20: 00, so that the ship can flexibly arrange the dam plan.
The "Dispatching Regulations" added the principle of "classified control" of ship overdam dispatching. According to the functional positioning of the ship lock and the ship lifter, the priority order of the ship crossing the dam is clearly defined, and the short-term passenger ship passing the gate is adjusted to the same priority as the demonstration ship and the integrity ship.
This is also the second anniversary of the trial operation of the ship lift, officially unified with the ship lock.
For the first time, the Chuanjiang River and the Three Gorges reservoir area large and wide demonstration vessels and new energy power vessels also ranked among the priority levels.
At the same time, the "Dispatching Regulations" will adjust the "navigable dispatch management waters" from the previous 180 kilometers near the dam waters to the Yunyang Yangtze River Bridge to the Shishou Yangtze River Bridge 541.8 kilometers of waters, and divide the "core waters, near the dam waters, control waters, dispatch waters."
This move is conducive to the ship's choice of suitable waters to be locked, reducing the backlog of ships to be locked in the dam area.
According to the characteristics of the current ship crossing the dam and waiting for the gate, the "Dispatching Regulations" also puts forward the integrity control measures such as the cancellation declaration of the offending ship and the 24-hour delay in crossing the dam.
After the Three Gorges water storage, the navigation conditions in the reservoir area have been improved, which has promoted the rapid development of Yangtze River shipping.
The data shows that the annual cargo passage of the Three Gorges Shiplock and Gezhouba Shiplock increased from 34.3 million tons in 2004 to 138 million tons and 140 million tons in 2017.
In the past two years, the Three Gorges ship lift has been piloted through 5767 ships, 162,200 passengers, and the cargo volume has reached 17.128 million tons.
Chen Dongyuan, deputy director of the Three Gorges Navigation Administration, said that the "Dispatching Regulations" have a positive effect on promoting the management of honest gates, maintaining the navigation order of the two dam hubs, relieving the pressure on the ships in the dam area, and improving the navigation ability.

For products that retain the management of industrial product production licenses, it is necessary to improve the standard system, give full play to the regulatory advantages of the industry, strengthen the responsibility of "who approves and who supervises," dynamically assess product quality and safety risks, reduce the catalogue in a timely manner, decentralize the approval authority or convert it to certification management.
In September, China's comprehensive PMI increased the manufacturing PMI from the previous month.
According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics of China on the 30th, in September, China's comprehensive PMI output index was 54.1%, which was higher than the previous month and the annual average of 0.3 and 0.1 percentage points, indicating that the overall production and operation activities of Chinese enterprises remained stable.
In the month, the manufacturing production index and the non-manufacturing business activity index, which constitute the comprehensive PMI output index, were 53.0% and 54.9% respectively, down one liter from the previous month.
Among them, China's manufacturing PMI was 50.8%, down 0.5 percentage points from the previous month.
Zhao Qinghe said that this month's manufacturing PMI has five main characteristics:
First, the fundamentals of the manufacturing industry are generally stable.
Among the 21 industries surveyed, the PMI of 14 industries is located in the expansion range, among which the manufacturing PMI of medicine, special equipment, electrical machinery and equipment is located at a higher operating level of more than 53.5%, and the growth rate is faster.
Second, supply and demand fluctuated slightly.
The production index and the new order index were 53.0% and 52.0%, respectively, down 0.3 and 0.2 percentage points from the previous month. Supply and demand continued to maintain a state of prosperity, but the expansion slowed slightly.
The new export order index and import index were 48.0% and 48.5%, respectively, lower than 1.4 and 0.6 percentage points last month, and the prosperity rate fell to the low point of the year.

Reuters, Nagoya, November 5th - Bank of Japan President Kuroda Toshihiko said on Monday that the central bank realized that the long-term implementation of ultra-loose monetary policy may squeeze the profit margin of financial institutions and may undermine the stability of the country's banking system.
However, he said that given the low inflation and uncertainty in overseas economies, the Bank of Japan needs to maintain its large-scale stimulus plan while paying close attention to the pros and cons of its policies.
"The Bank of Japan fully acknowledges that under the continued monetary easing, the strength of financial institutions will be increasingly affected," Kuroda said in a speech to business leaders in Nagoya.
He said that if financial institutions are more active in taking risks to make up for the narrowing of profit margins caused by low interest rates over the years, the banking system may be turbulent in the event of a serious negative impact.
"Although these risks are not great at the moment, the central bank will pay close attention to the development of the situation and encourage financial institutions to take necessary measures," he said.
The minutes of the Bank of Japan meeting released earlier on Monday showed that at the September meeting, the Bank of Japan Policy Committee discussed the rising cost of long-term easing.
According to the minutes of the meeting, a member said that if the economy continues to expand, "the Bank of Japan will have more flexibility in policy in the future."
According to the minutes of the meeting, another member said that given the limitations of the policy during the duration, the committee should discuss how long the Bank of Japan can maintain the stimulus policy.
Kuroda said that the Bank of Japan will assess the financial risks brought about by the easing policy, and also need to consider the uncertainty surrounding Japan's economic prospects. Due to Sino-US trade frictions and rising protectionism, it may affect global demand.
"The impact of such problems on the Japanese economy is temporarily limited," Kuroda said.
"But how the problem continues, the impact on the Japanese economy may become greater," he added.
"It is necessary to continue to carry out strong monetary easing policies and consider positive and negative effects in a balanced manner," Kuroda said.
Although the drawbacks of aggressive stimulus programs have increased, such as long-term low interest rates eroding the profits of financial institutions, low inflation has forced the Bank of Japan to maintain the program.
The Bank of Japan maintained monetary policy last month; in the face of risks from the global trade war, Kuroda ruled out the possibility of raising interest rates in the near future.
On June 1, 2018, Cardiff, USA, the corporate logo on the Tesla electric car.
According to a settlement agreement, Tesla Motors and its CEO Musk have agreed to pay a $20 million fine to the financial regulator. Musk will also resign as chairman of the company, but still serve as CEO.
The settlement agreement will put an end to Tesla's two-month turmoil.
The securities fraud allegations settlement agreement disclosed by the Securities and Exchange Commission on Saturday will give investors a sigh of relief.
Investors had worried that the protracted legal battle would only further crack down on the still-losing electric car company.
The SEC sued Musk for fraud on Thursday, saying its August 7 tweet misled investors.
Weiwen said that he is considering privatizing Tesla for $420 per share and has obtained financing.
The SEC said that these tweets are actually unfounded, and the market turmoil caused by them has damaged investors.
Investors and corporate governance experts say the agreement could strengthen Tesla, which has been hit hard by Musk's recent actions.
Steven Heim, head of Boston Common Asset Management, said the settlement should subject Musk to more supervision and did not take the "devastating" measures that drove him out of Tesla.
The asset management company holds shares in Tesla's battery manufacturer, Panasonic.
Under the proposed agreement, Tesla must appoint an independent chairman, two independent directors and a board of directors to develop control over Musk's external communication.
"The prompt resolution of this matter in accordance with the agreed conditions is in the best interests of our market and our investors, including Tesla shareholders," SEC Chairman Clayton said in a statement.
Thursday's allegations caused Tesla's market value to evaporate by about $7 billion, and the company's market value was $45.2 billion on Friday, down from GM's $47.5 billion.
In the settlement agreement, the SEC retracted the request to drive Musk off the head of the company.
Many investors said that this punishment will be disastrous.
"I think this is the best possible result for all relevant personnel," said Ivan Feinseth of Tigres Financial Partners. Feinseth gave Tesla a "neutral" rating and said the SEC's punishment was "lenient" for Musk.
"It's important for Tesla that he still serves as CEO."
Neither Musk nor Tesla acknowledged or denied the SEC's allegations in the settlement agreement and did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The settlement agreement still needs to be approved by the court.
Beijing Morning News (Reporter Wang Ping) Beijing Morning Post reporter recently learned from Beijing Construction Engineering Group that one of the core buildings of the 2019 Beijing World Expo Park, the Beijing World Expo Performing Arts Plaza project, will adopt multi-color ETFE puzzle film structure for the first time. The 5,440 square meters of membrane structure will present deep red, dark green, orange, blue, red, and green colors. Under the tension of the cable, the shape of the "butterfly wing."
According to Liu Changbao, the project leader of Beijing Construction Engineering Wujian Group, the construction area of the Performing Arts Plaza project is 4,500 square meters, the total amount of steel installed is 1,182 tons, and the steel roof is supported by a cantilevered steel truss arranged in 26 umbrellas. Under the tension of the cable steel strand, the shape of "butterfly wing" is presented.
"Overlooking the performing arts square from the air, the colorful roof is like a butterfly passing through the flowers, dancing, and the bright colors will not fade due to time and wind, frost, rain and snow."
Previously, the monochrome ETFE membrane structure was widely used in the Bird's Nest, Water Cube and other projects, but the multi-color puzzle ETFE membrane structure is the first in the country.
The reporter learned that because there are very few suppliers with a variety of color membrane structure production capacity in the world, every inch of membrane structure materials is very "precious."
Liu Changbao said that in order to avoid problems such as overlapping and "fighting" at the end of the cable, the "double fork ear" cable head structure will be innovated to ensure that the "fight" cable head is in the right position through a special fixed plug-in.
At present, the construction of the 2019 Beijing World Expo Park is underway.
Among them, the International Pavilion project has completed the lifting construction of all "flower umbrellas."
According to the plan, the project will be ready for exhibition at the end of October.

General Secretary Xi Jinping delivered a very important speech at the private enterprise symposium, injecting firm confidence into the broader stage of the private economy.
General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized that "letting entrepreneurs unload their ideological burdens and move forward lightly" has aroused strong resonance among entrepreneurs and innovative entrepreneurs.
Market vitality comes from people, especially from entrepreneurs, from entrepreneurship.
In the 40 years of reform and opening up, there are thousands of stories of entrepreneurs' entrepreneurial innovation, and the growth of the entrepreneurial community has continuously promoted the breaking of the Chinese economy.
For some time, some people in the society have made some remarks that deny and doubt the private economy.
The so-called "private economy departure theory" and "new public-private partnership theory" have caused some entrepreneurs' doubts and concerns.
Recently, some private enterprises have encountered many difficulties and problems in their business development.
For example, changes in the international economic environment have had an impact on some export enterprises; rapid adjustment of demand structure has brought pressure for transformation and upgrading; some policies are not coordinated with each other, policy effects are superimposed in the same direction, or the working method is simple, resulting in some original intentions. Good policies have produced the opposite effect and so on.
Various factors are intertwined, the private economy is experiencing difficulties, some private enterprises are facing difficulties, and entrepreneurs show a lot of anxiety.
In this context, correcting the misunderstanding of understanding, unloading the ideological burden of entrepreneurs, letting enterprises single-mindedly seek development, and the government single-mindedly promote development, which is related to market confidence and development expectations, has a particularly profound practical significance.
The symposium once again emphasized the important assertion that "the three have not changed": "The status and role of the non-public economy in China's economic and social development has not changed!"
From the in-depth promotion of decentralization and decentralization, the establishment of a power list system, to the creation of a rule of law environment that protects the legitimate rights and interests of entrepreneurs, to create a market environment of fair competition, and to shape the atmosphere of respect for entrepreneurs in the whole society. In recent years, the Party Central Committee has paid unprecedented attention to entrepreneurs and institutional guarantees.
The symposium clearly put forward policy measures to support the development and expansion of private enterprises in six aspects, and launched a series of pragmatic actions committed to private enterprises "light forward."
These are greatly encouraged by the entrepreneurial community and give more expectations to the community.
The fog has been opened, the policy has been set, and the key is to implement it.
It is necessary to continuously create a better development environment for the private economy, help private enterprises solve difficulties in development, and help realize China's economic transformation and upgrading; let entrepreneurs feel fair in market competition, feel safe in legitimate business, and feel respected in social life. Stimulate innovative vitality and creative potential.
The Chinese economy has entered the process of moving towards high-quality development, and more entrepreneurs need to show their ambitions. It also provides more space and stage for entrepreneurs to exert their creativity.
We have reason to believe that with the further deepening of reforms and the removal of obstacles, the private economy will usher in better development prospects and development opportunities, and move towards a broader stage.

On the morning of the 1st, Mr. Zhang, who traveled from Sichuan to the Yunnan estuary port on the Sino-Vietnamese border, and more than 500 troops, resident people, and Chinese and foreign tourists watched the flag-raising ceremony of the National Gate to celebrate the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
The estuary port is the largest port in the Yunnan section of the Sino-Vietnamese border. It is located in Hekou County, Honghe Prefecture, Yunnan Province. It is across the river from the old market in Vietnam and is a national port.
With the continuous deepening of the construction of the "One Belt, One Road" in the country, as one of the most convenient channels for China to connect Southeast Asia, the entry and exit flow of the estuary port has grown steadily.
At 7: 30 in the morning, the sun just revealed a corner. The restricted area of the estuary port gathered the local people and Chinese and foreign tourists who came to watch the flag-raising ceremony.
At 7: 45, the flag-raising ceremony began on time. The members of the honor guard of the border checkpoint at the mouth of the river were full of energy and escorted the national flag to the flag-raising platform with vigorous steps.
After the commander issued the flag-raising instructions, the flag-raiser struggled to draw an arc, and the bright five-star red flag stretched the flag like the "eagle wings," accompanied by the national anthem. The strong melody slowly rose.

During the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly, the parties released some positive information on the Korean Peninsula issue.
South Korean President Moon Jae-yin relayed the DPRK's "irreversible" nuclear abandonment determination and said that US President Trump and North Korea's supreme leader Kim Jong-un may meet before the end of this year.
The US State Department later said that Secretary of State Pompeo will visit North Korea in October to promote the implementation of the US-DPRK leader's Singapore meeting commitment.
Since the beginning of this year, the DPRK and the ROK have broken the ice to open the road of dialogue. The leaders of the DPRK, the DPRK and the United States have held meetings. The general trend of easing the situation on the peninsula has continued, and the principle of dialogue to resolve the peninsula issue has also been adhered to.
First of all, the "essence of the peninsula issue is a security issue" has not changed. To achieve peace on the peninsula, the key is to properly and balance the reasonable security concerns of all parties, rather than blindly pressuring each other and emphasizing their own demands.
Secondly, in the dialogue on realizing the denuclearization of the peninsula, the parties concerned still have differences on the steps and methods of realizing the denuclearization of the peninsula. Due to the long-term lack of political trust between the DPRK and the United States, the game thinking of "who is first and who is later" is still strong.
Recently, at the open meeting of the Security Council on the Korean Peninsula issue held at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, the different voices of the parties on the issue of sanctions against the DPRK once again highlighted the two points on the peninsula issue. "No change."
US Secretary of State Pompeo insisted that sanctions against North Korea will not be lifted until the Korean Peninsula is completely denuclearized.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov emphasized the principle of "responding to action with action." He pointed out: "The weakening trend of sanctions should be the same as the steps taken by North Korea on the road to gradual abandonment."
There is no doubt that all parties concerned should continue to implement the Security Council's resolutions on the DPRK in a comprehensive, complete and accurate manner, but pressure is not the end. The implementation of sanctions and the promotion of political settlement are the requirements of the Security Council resolutions.
As Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, in view of the current positive developments in the relations between the DPRK, the DPRK and the United States, China believes that it is necessary for the Security Council to consider launching reversible clauses in a timely manner, thus encouraging the DPRK and relevant parties to take greater steps toward denuclearization.
Looking back at the past, every progress in the denuclearization of the peninsula and the peace process requires sufficient political courage from all parties.
At present, in the face of the growing expectations of the international community to promote a political solution to the peninsula's problems, all parties concerned should show political courage, make political decisions, implement commitments, resolve problems, and continue to take steps toward each other. Promote the denuclearization process of the peninsula and establish a peace mechanism on the peninsula to jointly create a permanent peace on the peninsula.

Reuters, Tokyo, October 1st - The Bank of Japan's quarterly short-term survey released on Monday showed that the confidence of large Japanese manufacturers in the September quarter hit its lowest level in more than a year, due to rising raw material costs and a series of natural disasters affecting production, so that companies feel the pressure.
The survey almost did not show that the escalating global trade friction has hit the confidence of large manufacturers.
However, the risk of a full-scale trade war has hit the business prospects of enterprises and may threaten corporate capital expenditures.
Active capital expenditure is a bright spot in the Japanese economy.
The survey raised questions about the Bank of Japan's view that sound economic expansion will help accelerate inflation to reach the 2% target, although there are signs that companies are gradually passing on costs to customers.
"In the case of concerns caused by the global trade war, due to the slowdown in exports and weak factory production, the confidence of manufacturers tends to stagnate," said Nan Wuzhi, chief researcher of the Institute of Agriculture, Forestry and China.
"Confidence is still at a high level. And because corporate profits are improving and prices are rising, I don't think confidence will continue to decline."
According to the short-term survey, the large-scale manufacturing industry sentiment judgment index fell from positive 21 three months ago to positive 19 in September, which was the third consecutive quarter of deterioration.
The median estimate for the market is positive 22.
In September, the large-scale non-manufacturing sentiment judgment index fell from positive 24 in the June survey to positive 22, the first deterioration in eight quarters.
The Reuters survey is positive 22.
According to the survey, the large-scale manufacturing and non-manufacturing industry sentiment judgment index is expected to remain stable in December.
Investors did not care about the decline in the short-term corporate sentiment judgment index. The Japanese Nikkei .N225 rose to a 27-year high on Monday as the continued depreciation of the yen helped improve the export profit prospects of Japanese companies.
Capital expenditures are stable.
Despite the decline in business confidence, the latest short view highlights the soundness of corporate capital spending plans, thanks to the renewal of production capacity and increased investment in robots and automation to cope with labor shortages caused by population aging.
The central bank's short-term survey shows that large companies plan to increase capital expenditures by 13.4% in the current fiscal year ending March 2019.
The previous short-term survey was 13.6%.
Nan Wuzhi said that the capital expenditure plan of all enterprises in this fiscal year increased by 8.5%, close to the pace of the Japanese bubble economy era.
He said, "In view of the profit forecast of small enterprises from now on, there is still room for further growth in capital expenditure, but this depends largely on the impact of trade wars on business confidence."
The short-term survey shows that the ability of enterprises to pass on costs has increased. The output price index of large enterprises is positive 7, which is the high point in the past ten years. This is an encouraging sign, reflecting Japan's efforts to fight deflation. Progress.
The index measuring the employment status of large enterprises hit negative 23, the most tight level since 1992, highlighting the tightening of the job market.
Benefiting from strong corporate spending, the Japanese economy rebounded in the second quarter from the contraction in January-March this year.
However, the escalation of trade frictions in the summer and the disruption of the supply chain by natural disasters have overshadowed the export-dependent Japanese economic outlook.

Jean-Yves Le Gall, president of the International Astronautical Federation, said at the opening ceremony that the global space industry is no longer only a few countries and institutions participating.

Reuters, Beijing, November 5th - A press release issued by the China Foreign Trade Center on Sunday said that the Canton Fair shows that China's foreign trade situation is still complicated and severe. 80.6% of enterprises expect the export situation in 2018 to be better than the previous year or flat.
However, considering the external environment in which the cost of comprehensive factors such as domestic raw materials and labor continues to rise and the impact of Sino-US trade frictions increases, exhibitors also believe that the export situation next year is not optimistic.
At the closing press conference of the 124th Canton Fair, Xu Bing, deputy secretary-general of the Canton Fair, spokesperson and deputy director of the China Foreign Trade Center, said that the number of overseas buyers and export transactions of the Canton Fair have dropped slightly year-on-year.
The current buyers attended the meeting 189,812 people, from 215 countries and regions, down 1.11% year-on-year.
Export transactions amounted to 206.494 billion yuan (equivalent to 29.86 billion US dollars), down 1% year-on-year.
From the market point of view, the transaction volume of Japan, ASEAN, BRIC, and South Korea increased by 74.4%, 11.4%, 7.2%, 2.5% respectively, and the traditional markets such as the United States, Australia, Canada and the European Union decreased by 30.3%, 8.9%, 7.3%, 0.8% respectively.

Xu Bing said that as a barometer and vane of China's foreign trade, the current Canton Fair buyers' participation situation and export transaction data show that China's foreign trade development will still face many uncertain and unstable factors next year.
However, with the deepening of supply-side structural reforms and the recent introduction of "six stability" and other policies and measures by the state and local governments, the new kinetic energy of China's foreign trade development is accelerating the accumulation, and the diversification of the enterprise market continues to make new progress. These are important foundations and powerful conditions for the development of foreign trade.
"Based on various factors, it is expected that China's foreign trade import and export will maintain steady growth throughout the year, and the quality and efficiency will be further improved." Xu Bing said.
The General Administration of Customs of China announced that exports denominated in US dollars increased by 14.5% year-on-year in September, imports increased by 14.3% year-on-year, and the trade surplus in September was 31.69 billion US dollars. The export growth rate and trade surplus in September were the highest since February this year.
Despite the escalating trade frictions between China and the United States, China's export performance in September still exceeded expectations. External demand was strong, enterprises seized exports before the US imposed tariffs, and the RMB exchange rate depreciated, or the main supporting factors also showed China's foreign trade. Resilience, but the impact of the Sino-US trade war on confidence and the impact on the industrial chain should not be underestimated. Analysts believe that the challenges of China's foreign trade may appear in the fourth quarter or next year.
According to a Reuters survey, US fund managers proposed to increase their cash holdings in September and continue to be cautious, as the United States and China began the latest round of mutual import tariffs, and the dispute did not show signs of easing.

The global stock allocation accounted for an average of 56.6%, and the bond ratio was 35.5%, basically in line with last month's survey.
The most obvious change is that the cash ratio rose to 5.1%, the highest since December 2014.
A fund manager of a large fund company said, "Some economic data has brought confidence to the market, but the trade war is still the biggest concern, so it is best to be prepared to enter when the market falls."
However, fund managers still prefer stocks in September, especially US stocks, even if US stocks are considered to be on the high side.
Today, in China's open landmark Shanghai, the world's first large-scale national exhibition with the theme of import, the China International Import Expo, officially kicked off in the expectation of all.
An exhibition is like a "window" that allows the world to better understand a city and a country.
Through the "window" of the Expo, people see the "open China" to a higher level; with the "window" of the Expo, welcome the world and China's mutual benefit and win-win situation of "reform and opening up."
"For a country, openness is like breaking a cocoon into a butterfly. Although it will experience a moment of pain, it will be exchanged for a new life."
General Secretary Xi Jinping's summary of the road to opening up has revealed an important reason for "why China can."
Looking back on the 40 years of reform and opening up, China, which dares to enter the world market, has encountered whirlpools and storms, but has always faced all risks and challenges with an open attitude, continuously releasing endogenous motivation and continuously improving its competitiveness.
It can be said that China has effectively interpreted the value and significance of openness with its own practical achievements.
Standing at a new historical starting point, holding an import-themed expo is a major decision made by the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core to promote a new round of high-level opening to the outside world. It is a major measure for China to take the initiative to open its market to the world. China's support for economic globalization and trade liberalization has demonstrated the strong and clear will that "China's open door will not be closed, but will only get bigger and bigger."
The participation of exhibitors from all over the world and the "one hard to find" booth are the biggest affirmation and best response to China's development of an open economy on a larger scale, in a wider field and at a deeper level.
More importantly, the current global economic and trade order has reached a crossroads.
Some countries have built a high wall of trade protectionism and returned to the old path of unilateralism, which has increased the international community's concerns about the prospects for free trade and added a lot of uncertainty to the warming world economy.
In the context of this era, the event on the banks of the Huangpu River reflects China's defense of free trade, allowing the world to see open markets and share the future of China's self-confidence and China's commitment.
Walk fast, walk far.
China's open mind and embrace of the world have not only effectively promoted its own development, but also brought surging "China opportunities" to countries and regions around the world.
In recent years, we have advocated and promoted the joint construction of the "One Belt, One Road," initiated the establishment of the AIIB, and established the Silk Road Fund... China has provided a series of international public goods, providing real export markets, development opportunities and jobs, and allowing enterprises from all over the world to take China's development. "Express" "
The Expo is also such a public good and a big platform for global economic and trade cooperation.
On this platform, more than 3,000 companies in more than 130 countries and regions have taken a new step in the Chinese market with their own quality products and services.
In addition to national companies, domestic consumers are also really benefiting.
By building this platform of "optimization and excellence," it provides a multi-channel high-quality supply for consumption upgrading to meet the individualized, diversified and differentiated consumption needs of the people.
As the door to China's opening opens wider and wider, the goods flow smoothly, make the best use of it, and the pace of moving towards a better life will be more solid.
From a more macro perspective, the significance of entering the Expo has gone beyond the scope of economy and trade, but focuses on the future, conveying the concept of openness, tolerance, inclusion, balance and win-win, and forming a consensus to jointly address today's challenges.
The world is good, China can be good; China is good, the world is better.
We look forward to the wonderful and complete world of the Expo; we are more eager to move towards a higher level of "open China" and the world to work together to build a glorious future of the community of human destiny.
Foreign media: The United States and Canada reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
[Abstract] The agreement includes Canada's opening of its dairy market to the United States, and the United States temporarily does not impose tariffs on cars produced in Canada.
According to foreign media reports, a Canadian source revealed on the evening of September 30 that the United States and Canada have reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
According to reports, the agreement includes Canada's opening of its dairy market to the United States, and the United States temporarily does not impose tariffs on cars produced in Canada.
On the 27th of last month, the United States and Mexico announced a preliminary principled agreement on updating the North American Free Trade Agreement, but the United States and Canada failed to reach an agreement before the August 31 deadline set by the US, extending the negotiation period to September 30.
Earlier, a spokesman for Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland said that Canada will only sign a favorable agreement. "The focus is on the substance, not the timetable. We will continue to negotiate and hope to reach an agreement that is in the national interest of Canada."
More than 90% of Brazilian female voters said that presidential candidates did not consider women's needs.
According to the South American Overseas Chinese News Network, data released by the Brazilian National Institute of Geography (IBGE) recently showed that more than 90% of Brazilian women do not think that presidential candidates consider the needs of women.
According to the report, at present, the number of women in Brazil has reached 107 million. If women from all over Brazil are gathered to form a country, then the country's population will rank 13th in the world, more than twice the population of Spain.
In Brazil, the number of female voters accounts for 52% of the total number of voters, and men account for 48%. Although the proportion of women in the electorate is very high, the proportion of women in the Brazilian Congress is only 10%.
Among the 193 countries in the world, Brazilian women ranked only 154th in political participation, higher than the Arab countries.
After more than 20 years of struggle for rights, Brazilian women still have not succeeded in gaining their due rights.
Brazilian sociologist Natalia Mori pointed out that the reason for this phenomenon is the result of the combination of ancient patrilineal society, racism and capitalist values.
"Politics should have been advocated by citizens for civil rights, identity, access to public goods, and a society composed of multiple social groups. But Brazilian politics is a monopoly of a certain group, and most of the population is not represented."
A previous study by the Brazilian Locomotiva Institute also pointed out that 94% of Brazilian women do not feel that the elected politicians can represent their rights. 90% of Brazilian women disagree with the decisions made by politicians. 93% of women disagree with the current government's policy.
"We need to reverse the underrepresentation of women in parliament. Brazil's political system is still affected by inequality. So far, there are still serious gender, class and racial discrimination in Brazil's political arena." Natalia Mori said.
Despite the lack of women's rights, most Brazilian women still believe in the power of democracy.
According to the survey, 76% of women believe that they can make a difference in democratic elections, and 72% of women are interested in politics.
In addition, 55% of women believe that democratic politics is the best way to make women suffer less prejudice.

According to reports, the new terminal building of Guilin Airport can meet the peak flow of nearly 4,000 people entering and leaving the port per hour, and apply the "smart airport" technical means such as intelligent baggage sorting system, security integration platform and face recognition to plan the business district covering catering, department stores, tax exemption and leisure and entertainment.
Since most of the growth in Europe, Asia and emerging markets is not encouraging, the United States is increasingly becoming the main engine of global economic growth.
On September 23, 2018, a container freighter moored in the port of New Jersey, USA.
However, since the current growth in the United States has benefited from the time of the fiscal stimulus of tax cuts, the country's economy has also received close attention from the outside world.
"As the United States is returning to full employment, a downturn in the economy is inevitable."
He said that the only question is when it will happen. In his view, it may only be pushed back in advance.
Although Barclays is optimistic about the US economic outlook before the end of this year, the bank admits that it is more difficult to predict further time.
"In the absence of more sustainable investment growth to boost economic growth potential, the current growth inspired by fiscal policy will be unsustainable," Barclays economists said in a research report.
"In the absence of investment growth, the risk of a hard landing in 2020 will rise," they said.
A series of corporate surveys will roughly show that major economies are in the economic cycle stage at the end of the third quarter.
The Eurozone and US manufacturing surveys scheduled to be released next Monday will receive attention, and the service industry survey will be announced on Wednesday.
But the focus of next week's data will inevitably be the US non-farm payrolls data to be released next Friday, which will provide clues about whether the tight job market is driving significant wage growth.
Its importance is not only important for the profitability of the company and the purchasing power of consumers, but also because the increase in wages or the rise in overall inflation may make the US Federal Reserve (Fed / FED) officials feel uneasy.
"Salary will receive much attention because it may rise sharply again from the previous month.
The increase in September from the same period of the previous year may not exceed 3%, but we can fully expect to break through next month, "ING economists wrote in a research report.
At a time when the holidays in China and other parts of Asia have caused the region's data to be light next week, the European political situation may become a source of market volatility.
The Italian government ignores the previous financial commitments to the EU, and other EU member states will have to quickly determine whether to resolutely oppose Italy's decision. Tria does not support the decision, he hopes to comply with EU rules.
As the Brexit negotiations enter a critical stage, the annual meeting of the British Conservative Party in Birmingham may also spark.
At the same time, with Brazil's highly anticipated presidential election next weekend, concerns about emerging markets are unlikely to weaken.
[Abstract] After the completion of the ship, it will be delivered to the East China Sea Branch of the State Oceanic Administration of China. Chen Wei, Director of the Observation Department of the Marine Early Warning and Monitoring Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China, said that the ship will be put into use, which will be of great significance for the development of China's offshore ocean observation system and the promotion of global ocean observations.
On September 29, China's first 3,000-ton large-scale buoy ship, the Sunward Red 22, was launched at the China Wushu Group.
After the completion of the ship, it will break the current equipment bottleneck in China's support work such as large buoys, submersible placement, recycling, and repair.
The "Sunward Red 22" wheel is mainly used for regular inspection and maintenance of buoys / submersibles, regular deployment, recycling, buoy / submersible emergency placement, recovery, repair and other support work, and at the same time has the ability to perform cross-sectional surveys and other comprehensive marine survey tasks.
The new ship has a total length of 89 meters, a width of 18 meters, a depth of 7.2 meters, and a range of 10,000 nautical miles.
Wang Weiling, deputy general manager of Wushang Group, said: "Xiangyang Red 22 is the first large-scale buoy operation ship in China. It is also the only working ship in China with the ability to lift a 10-meter large buoy operation, which will further enhance China's large-scale buoy support capability."
It is understood that after the completion of the ship, it will be delivered to the East China Sea Branch of the State Oceanic Administration of China. Chen Wei, Director of the Observation Department of the Marine Early Warning and Monitoring Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China, said that the ship will be put into use, which will be of great significance for the development of China's offshore ocean observation system and the promotion of global ocean observations.
"This ship also has a large-scale buoy deployment and maintenance operation, and also has a comprehensive marine survey capability. It is the first comprehensive ship in China dedicated to the operation of the mid-ocean buoy and the comprehensive marine survey.
With such a buoy operating ship, our ocean observations and ocean surveys will have a powerful weapon in the future. "
Chinanews.com, Qingdao, October 1st, affected by the typhoon "Tan Mei," the 2018 International Extreme Sailing Series Qingdao Station "Maze Run Cup," which was scheduled to start on September 30th, postponed the first competition day to October 1st, and held a pre-match meeting at the Qingdao Olympic Sailing Center before the game. The captain of the 12 water-wing double-bodied sailing team from 6 countries and regions appeared.
Affected by the typhoon "Tan Mei," the strong winds in the port pool continued, and the maximum wind speed was even as high as 24 knots. The sailing signal was postponed for nearly 90 minutes from 1 pm on the 30th. The wind speed was still not reduced. The referee of the event, Anne Mderant, announced the cancellation of the first day of the match and postponed the match until the afternoon of October 1.
"The strong winds blowing from the shore continue, and the sea conditions are too intense."
Mderant explained: "In this case, no one knows when the wind blows to the boat.
Near the city's arena, in terms of current conditions, canceling the game is the smartest choice. "
All the crew members who are ready are still somewhat disappointed.
"The boat is ready to stop, and we are in good shape."
Max Richardson, the helmsman of the Qingdao team, said frankly: "But I know that the rescheduling of the game is the right choice, and I hope that today's wind energy is smaller, we can show our skills."
Omica Wilkinson, the "Star of Hope" of the New Zealand team for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, said: "Losing a day makes the game more interesting.
Because the weight of today's game will increase, and there are only two days left.
Everyone will definitely work hard. "
Although the sea breeze is fierce, Pierre Ives Durand, the helmsman of the French ABM team, told his warm past with Qingdao, the venue of the competition, at the pre-match meeting: 5 years ago, the International Extreme Sailing Series was accidentally injured and the muscles were broken. Thanks to the handling of the local event medical team, he can still stand at the venue today after 5 years.
It is reported that the International Extreme Sailing Series was founded in 2007 and is a world sailing league event with Volvo, the America's Cup, the World Sailing Tour and other events.
The Qingdao race will use the "Flying Ghost" water wing double sail (Flying Phantom).
2018 is the eighth year of the event's landing in Qingdao, the "sailing capital," and Qingdao Station is also the final battle of the series.
Despite the continued volatility of the global financial market, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said on Monday that the investment income of the Exchange Fund in the third quarter of this year was significantly reduced by 97% year-on-year but better than the performance of the previous quarter. Due to the Sino-US trade war, overseas stocks rose and foreign exchange losses also narrowed significantly.
According to the latest data of the HKMA, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK $1.6 billion in July-September 2018, which was significantly lower than the HK $61.8 billion in the same period last year, but better than the revised HK $100 million in the second quarter of this year.
Chen Delin, president of the HKMA, said in the Legislative Council that at the beginning of the Sino-US trade war, the Hong Kong and emerging market stock indexes ran counter to the US stock index. After the US stock market index peaked in late September and early October, market sentiment began to reverse. As investors gradually realized that the trade war was also unfavorable to the United States itself.
"It is a good thing that market sentiment changes. If the trade war has only one-sided influence, it will not help to solve the problem."
However, he also pointed out that "if the Sino-US trade war is not resolved, financial market volatility will continue to rise."
In the third quarter of this year, the stock investment loss of the Exchange Fund in Hong Kong narrowed by 8% to HK $4.7 billion from the previous quarter, while the investment income of overseas stocks increased by 172% to HK $12.8 billion; the foreign exchange loss was HK $16.2 billion, and the bond income was HK $9.7 billion. The quarter decreased by 24% and 31% respectively, mainly reflecting the general increase in the US dollar against major currencies during the quarter and the US fruits rate rose by 3% in mid-September.
The Exchange Fund is mainly used to support the Hong Kong dollar.
Since 1983, Hong Kong has implemented a linked exchange rate system linking the Hong Kong dollar to the US dollar.
Regarding the current financial situation in Hong Kong, Chen Delin said that economic and asset market uncertainty has increased and downside risks have increased. However, Hong Kong's financial system is stable and defensive, and its seismic capacity is abundant.
"Hong Kong's international investment position is abundant. The foreign net asset value is 1.4 trillion US dollars equivalent to 4 times GDP, which is 2.5 times higher than that of Singapore and 0.6 times that of Japan. It is more than enough to cope with the economic downturn or reversal."
Recently, the Hong Kong dollar interest rate continued to fall and the spread with the US dollar expanded. Chen Delin pointed out that the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate rose by more than 400 basis points on September 21. The market generally believes that it is mainly related to the rise in Hong Kong dollar interest rates. After that, the Hong Kong dollar against the US dollar hovered around 7.80-7.84.
However, he believes that with the beginning of the interest rate hike cycle of Hong Kong banks and the normalization of Hong Kong dollar interest rates, the future situation of the Hong Kong dollar interest rate below the US dollar interest rate will change.
"The trend of Hong Kong dollar interest rates and US dollar interest rates will be more consistent. Everyone must be more careful to manage risks and be prepared to cope with market fluctuations."
Due to the abundant Hong Kong dollar funds, the Hong Kong dollar interest rate fell further. The three-month interest rate fell by 0.9% to 2.08179% on Monday, and the spread with the US dollar increased from 46 basis points to 51 basis points; the one-month interest rate hit a five-month low. The spread with the US dollar expanded from 120 basis points to 127 basis points.
From May to mid-September, the Hong Kong dollar spot exchange rate was close to 7.85 to the US dollar for most of the time.
During the period, due to factors such as the outflow of funds from the arbitrage activities and the completion of large-scale prospectus activities, the weak party exchange guarantee was triggered several times in May and August after it was triggered for the first time in April.
The HKMA buys Hong Kong dollars and sells US dollars at the 7.85 level in accordance with the linked exchange rate system to maintain the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.
In May and August, the HKMA bought a total of about HK $52.1 billion under the weak exchange guarantee mechanism.
Is the new tax law still preferential for foreigners?
The relevant person in charge of the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation said in response to a reporter's question on the 30th that in order to maintain policy stability, the next step in implementing the new personal income tax law will be to consider continuing to make preferential arrangements for overseas people, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
A reporter asked that the newly revised personal income tax law adjusted the judgment standard for personal income tax residents in China from one year to 183 days.
In the next step, when implementing the law, are there any preferential arrangements for overseas people, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan?
The person in charge responded that the current personal income tax law implementation regulations have special preferential provisions for overseas tax payment issues. Individuals who have no residence in China but live for more than one year and less than five years may only pay personal income tax on the part paid by units or individuals in China.
The person in charge said that in order to maintain policy stability, the next step in implementing the new personal income tax law will be to consider continuing to make preferential arrangements for overseas people, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
There is no "threshold" of the moon center: quality certification to promote quality.
With the pull of the "two-child economy" and the prosperity of the mother and child market, from the north to the third and fourth tier cities, various grades of monthly clubs have emerged.
At present, the very hot monthly clubs meet the consumption needs of the masses. The fees range from tens of thousands of yuan to hundreds of thousands of yuan, but they are also in an embarrassing situation. This institution has no threshold so far, and there are still gaps in supervision.
The State Administration of Market Supervision recently launched the 2018 National "Quality Month" series of activities. The reporter came to a five-star month center in Tianjin to visit the mother and child care service certification experience.
The general moon center provides services such as newborn care, nutritious meals, and postpartum repair and shaping.
In this month center, the reporter saw that the nurse checked the breastfeeding of the newborn every day, and the professional nurse provided the newborn with fine nursing services such as bathing and touching.
At the same time, in order to meet the needs of new mothers, from the early wound care of the moon, to the mid-to-late beauty care and other services, to provide Chinese medicine treatment and beauty and other care projects to help mothers restore their posture.
A new mother who lived in the house told reporters that she booked the moon club eight months in advance.
The service items of the Moon Club directly affect the comfort level and physical recovery during the maternal month. Some small-scale monthly clubs can only provide some simple monthly services. There are disinfection and hygiene irregularities, easy cross-infection, and single unscientific diet.
The person in charge of this month sub-center said that they are the only one of all five-star month sub-centers in Tianjin to obtain B-level service certification.
"Although some customers did not understand the meaning of B-level certification at first, it is important for the long-term development of the company to force the company to strictly standardize the process management through certification, so that customers can benefit."
Pan Lifen, deputy director of the Certification and Supervision Department of the State Administration of Market Supervision, said that service certification is a new type of certification system based on customer perception, attention to organizational quality management and service characteristics satisfaction. It is an important part of the national quality infrastructure and has a positive effect on improving the proportion of quality service supply and enhancing the international competitiveness of Chinese services.
China started in 2004. After more than 10 years of development, the service certification project has undergone a process of gradual development from scratch, and has emerged such as financial service certification, maternal and child care service certification, after-sales service certification, e-commerce service certification, and health service certification. A number of influential service certifications.
According to the statistics of the State Administration of Market Supervision, there are currently more than 130 service certification institutions in China, more than 2,000 service certification personnel, and nearly 8,000 valid certification certificates.
Pan Lifen said that it is necessary to further guide and promote the development of service certification, gradually expand service certification coverage in the fields of health, education, sports, finance and e-commerce, and promote supply-side reform and quality improvement in the service industry.
Reuters, Hong Kong, November 5th - Hong Kong property prices have fallen for two consecutive months after peaking. Chen Delin, president of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, said on Monday that it is time for fashion to observe whether the property market has entered a downward cycle. If confirmed, it can be considered. Relax the tightening policy of counter-cyclical measures in due course.
Chen Delin also pointed out that if the property price is adjusted back, the first to be affected will be those who buy their homes at the peak of the property market. However, it is expected that there will be a sharp drop in property prices during the Asian financial turmoil in 1997, and the public will cut prices. The opportunity to sell the property is much lower.
When Chen Delin led a number of senior officials of the HKMA to attend the Legislative Council briefing, he said that if the property market enters a downward cycle, it can relax measures in due course.
"But now I only see a few weeks of data, and I am still relaxed. I still have to spend more time to see if the property market is entering a downward cycle."
Since October 2009, the HKMA has launched eight rounds of counter-cyclical measures to significantly tighten the mortgage of various types of properties, including reducing the number of mortgages, mortgage applicants must pass rigorous stress tests, etc., to enhance bank risk management and earthquake resistance.
As Hong Kong officially entered the interest rate hike cycle, the private residential property price index in Hong Kong peaked for two consecutive months from August to September, and the monthly decline in September expanded to 1.44%.
However, the cumulative increase in the first three quarters of this year is still 10.2%.
According to the HKMA data, the financial situation of households measuring Hong Kong's ability to withstand financial risks is still healthy. In the second quarter of this year, the proportion of households without mortgages in Hong Kong reached 66%, which is higher than the average of 60% in 2009-11. The average mortgage ratio and the contribution and income ratio of newly approved mortgages were 47% and 34% respectively, which were significantly improved from 64% and 41% respectively in 2009-11.
However, Chen Delin said that the high seismic capacity does not mean that the citizens who have already bought a home will not be damaged by the economic downturn, because the property valuation will fall, and those who buy a house at the peak will bear the brunt.
Although the HKMA has tightened bank lending to mortgage lenders, home buyers can also obtain high-volume mortgage loans through mortgage insurance or mortgage loans provided by developers.
Chen Delin said that at present, together with the mortgage loans provided to the developer, the borrower's mortgage ratio can reach 85-90%. If the property price falls by 10%, there will be negative assets (that is, the market value of the property will fall below the total amount of outstanding mortgage loans).
However, Yan Guoheng, vice president of the HKMA, pointed out that the authorities estimate that the total amount of mortgages provided by developers is only 2-2.5% of the total amount of bank mortgages, and the proportion is still low.
At the peak of Hong Kong's negative assets in 2003, the number of negative assets exceeded 100,000, accounting for 22% of the supply.
As of the third quarter of this year, Hong Kong has recorded zero negative assets for seven consecutive quarters.

The notice pointed out that the specific tax exemption management measures are formulated by the provincial tax department's financial and commercial departments.
The Office of the Leading Group for the Construction of Comprehensive Test Areas and the competent commercial departments should coordinate the communication and cooperation between the departments and the implementation of relevant policies, accelerate the establishment of an e-commerce export statistics monitoring system, and promote the healthy and rapid development of cross-border e-commerce.
Zhongxin.com, Erdos, November 5 (Zhang Linhu) Due to differences in the distribution of money, a man in Liaoning Province killed his lover and dumped his body, and then fled to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

"Five Development and Beautiful Anhui" "Green Development in Action" theme train on-line operation
The second theme train of "Five Development, Beautiful Anhui" - "Green Development in Action" theme train was officially put into operation on the 5th.
In order to comprehensively display the brilliant achievements of the construction of the "Five Great Development and Beautiful Anhui," Hefei Railway Company and Jinjuan Media Technology Co., Ltd. jointly designed and produced the "Five Major Development, Beautiful Anhui" series of theme trains.

Zhongxin.com, Shenzhen, October 1st (Zheng Xiaohong, Xu Dianwei, Liu Yumeng) October 1st is the first day of the "Golden Week" of the National Day of the Mainland. It is also the last day of the Hong Kong National Day public holiday. Many mainland residents use the holiday to go abroad to play and shop. There are also many Hong Kong residents who come to Shenzhen to return to Hong Kong on the same day. The situation of passenger flow "bursting the shed" at various ports in Shenzhen, Luohu and Shenzhen Bay ports have opened 22 new self-service channels to improve the efficiency of customs clearance of the ports, and facilitate efficient customs clearance of the ports.
According to the data provided by the Shenzhen Frontier Inspection Station, as of 16 pm on the same day, the number of people entering and leaving the Shenzhen Port reached more than 429,000, and the number of transportation tools reached more than 16,800 (vessels, frames, columns). The ports have always been busy and have maintained a good entry and exit order.
It is understood that due to many positive factors such as the increase in the number of countries providing exit visa-free policies for Chinese citizens, the number of passengers using the National Day holiday to travel to Europe and Southeast Asia and other countries for holiday shopping continues to increase.
On the morning of the 1st, the exit direction of Luohu, Shenzhen Bay, Huanggang, Futian and other ports ushered in the peak of passenger (car) flow. The peak passenger flow of Luohu Port lasted from 9: 00 am to 11: 00 am. Shenzhen Bay Port passenger (car) flow peak from 6: 30 am to 13: 00 noon.
According to reports, in order to cope with the peak flow of inbound and outbound passengers (vehicles), the Shenzhen Frontier Inspection General Station is deployed in accordance with the National Immigration Administration, starting the passenger (vehicle) flow peak hours service mode, arranging overtime police to support the first line of duty, opening the inspection channel in advance, guiding passengers and vehicles to wait in an orderly manner, ensuring that Chinese citizens' entry and exit customs clearance queues do not exceed 30 minutes, while taking into account the efficiency of foreigners; strengthening the order maintenance of crowded areas, ensuring safe and orderly customs clearance.
The Shenzhen Frontier Inspection General Station also reminds inbound and outbound passengers that they should pay attention to the validity period of documents and visas and endorsements before travel, rationally arrange their trips, try to avoid peak passenger flow periods, and choose the right time and the right port to travel.
Passengers travelling to Hong Kong on the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong high-speed rail must hold valid entry and exit documents and visa endorsements. The high-speed rail ticket is only a ticket for the ride. It cannot be used as an entry and exit document. If you cannot leave the country for Hong Kong due to non-compliance with the documents, you should follow the guidelines of the border inspection police and wait for the MTR staff to return to the Mainland at the designated location.
Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic and difficult disease involving multiple organs of the whole body. It used to be considered an "incurable disease."
Because its pathogenesis is unknown, diagnosis and treatment is difficult, and there is no effective treatment.
Recently, Liu Wanli, a researcher at the School of Life Sciences of Tsinghua University, and Li Zhanguo, director of the Rheumatology Immunology Center of Peking University People's Hospital, discovered that human immunoglobulin has molecular variations that increase the susceptibility of systemic lupus erythematosus, and this variation is involved in regulating immune B cells.
In short, the two teams confirmed that an abnormal immune molecule in the human body is an important cause of systemic lupus erythematosus.
According to Sun Xiaolin, one of the authors of the article and the Peking University People's Hospital, the Li Zhanguo team collected nearly 2,000 large samples of systemic lupus erythematosus patients and conducted research. It was found that patients with immunoglobulin variation produced pathogenic cells and a wide variety of autoantibodies. The incidence and severity of inflammation such as nephritis, arthritis, serous inflammation and vasculitis increased significantly.
Through various research methods such as immune cell tracer, animal test, and sequencing, Liu Wanli's team found that the immune signal pathway activated by this immune molecular mutation promotes the pathogenic mechanism of B cells secreting multiple autoantibodies.
The reporter learned that the two teams are strong and united, giving full play to their respective advantages, and realizing the close integration of basic research and clinical application.
Liu Wanli team is committed to B lymphocyte immune recognition and immune activation research, while Li Zhanguo team has long been engaged in clinical research on systemic lupus erythematosus.
"This study is one of the results of many years of cooperation between the two teams. It is also the first time that the academic community has recognized that immunoglobulin genetic abnormalities will induce systemic lupus erythematosus, laying a solid foundation for further academic research and clinical targeted treatment."
This is not to protect the short, but to act according to law.
Lawyers carrying axes to court?
The news was really exciting at first glance, and it also exploded in the legal circle.
Quanzhou City, Fujian Province, China and France subsequently imposed a fine of 500 yuan on the lawyers involved, and suggested in writing that Quanzhou City Lawyers Association conduct investigations.
According to the Beijing News, a few days ago, the Quanzhou City Law Association issued a formal notice saying that the actions of the two lawyers did not involve violations of laws and regulations, and were not punished according to law.
From many reports, the Quanzhou City Law Association's handling is not to protect the short or engage in confrontation, but has been recognized by the Quanzhou Intermediate People's Court.
An incident that might have triggered tensions within the legal community was eventually properly resolved.
The reversal of the matter stems from a more complete restoration of the truth: the axe carried by the lawyer involved is the same style and the same model as the defendant's murder weapon, but it has not been opened. It is only used as auxiliary evidence in the evidence cross-examination process, and there is no intimidation. The subjective intention of "endangering the safety of the court."
Judging whether the behavior of the lawyers involved is illegal and illegal, there are four very important details that need to be paid attention to: First, the local court has only presented the axe photos twice before the trial. From the perspective of the defense, it is necessary to present the original axe. Second, the axe was purchased one hour before the trial. It is not that the lawyer is unwilling to seek the consent of the judge, but objectively failed to contact the judge; thirdly, the entire axe has not been used too aggressively or improperly; fourthly, the lawyer involved in the first time publicly acknowledged the case, and expressed his apology to the court.
Based on these circumstances, it can be seen that the lawyers involved in the case "appear in court with axes" have nothing to do with evil, just to defend.
After clarifying the whole fact, the Quanzhou City Law Association did not push the boat, but withstood the pressure and made a decision not to punish.
This decision can also withstand the test of facts and laws.
As for bringing the axe as a controlled tool to the court without the permission of the court, it is indeed easy to cause uneasiness and misunderstanding.
For reasons of safety and caution, the previous fines and judicial recommendations of Quanzhou Intermediate People's Court are also understandable.
In order to maintain the dignity of lawyers and prevent individual courts from making it difficult for lawyers, the Supreme Law issued the "Rules for the Safety Inspection of Judicial Police of the People's Court" in 2014, establishing the principle that lawyers do not need to conduct personal security inspections when they appear in court.
Since the release of the rule, the majority of lawyers have led by example, and there have been few incidents in which security loopholes have jeopardized the safety of the court.
In a very few cases like Quanzhou, as long as the spirit of mutual respect and understanding is communicated, misunderstandings are not difficult to eliminate.
As a self-regulatory organization of the lawyer industry, the Bar Association undertakes the dual mission of punishing illegal activities and safeguarding legality.
In the past, individual law associations have been criticized for their emphasis on punishment and their loss of protection.
The decision of Quanzhou Law Association, both in terms of process and results, is commendable and sets an example for more law associations to perform their duties correctly.
From October 1st, which tax benefits will affect our money bag?
Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 1 (Reporter Sang Wei) The new personal income tax law will be implemented on January 1, 2019. In order to allow the broad masses of the people to enjoy the tax reduction dividends as soon as possible, from October 1st, the actual salary of the taxpayer will be deducted according to the threshold of 5,000 yuan per month, and the new tax rate table will be applied.
With the landing of the New Deal, what benefits will affect the money bags of the masses?
Good one: the tax reduction of wages and salaries is obvious
Taxpayers who receive wages and salaries after October 1 can deduct the basic deduction of 5,000 yuan / month and apply the new tax rate table. Most taxpayers have different degrees of tax reduction, especially for low- and middle-income people.
According to the tax reduction table of different income groups, the monthly income after deducting the "three risks and one gold" is 8,000 yuan, 10,000 yuan, 20,000 yuan, and 50,000 yuan. The tax payable after the tax reform is 90 yuan, 290 yuan, 1590 yuan, 9090 yuan, compared with the monthly threshold of 3,500 yuan, the corresponding tax reduction ratio is 73.9%, 61.1%, 49.0%, 18.8%.
It is worth noting that due to holidays, the wages that should be paid in October by each unit at the end of September can be applied to the new basic deduction fee and tax rate table.
To this end, the withholding client software used by the tax department has provided the corresponding tax calculation function, but the corresponding tax still needs to be declared and paid during the statutory declaration period.
Good 2: Low tax rate range is significantly enlarged
In addition to raising the threshold, the new tax rate table will be applied from October 1.
The seven-grade tax rate of this salary and salary income is the same as before, and there is no change, but the tax rate range has changed significantly. The 3%, 10%, and 20% of the three-grade low-tax rate has expanded significantly, and the 25% tax rate has been reduced. The distance between the three higher tax rates of 30%, 35%, and 45% remains unchanged.

The Okinawa Governor's election, which was held in advance due to the death of former Governor Weng Changxiongzhi, announced the results in the early morning of the 1st local time, and Yucheng Danny, who opposed the relocation plan of the US military base in Japan, was successfully elected.
The election was counted on September 30. The final results showed that Yucheng received a total of 396.632 million votes, creating the highest number of votes in the history of the Okinawa Prefectural Governor's election, more than 80,000 votes more than its main rival, Sasaki Shinchun.
A total of four candidates participated in the election, with a voter turnout of 63.24%, down 0.89 percentage points from the 2014 Okinawa Prefectural Governor election.
Yucheng said to the media on the 1st that the election results showed that the county people did not want to let the efforts of Governor Weng's life in vain. He will inherit the legacy of Governor Weng and continue to oppose the relocation plan of the US military base and the closure of the Futenma base. Efforts to the Japanese government and the US government.
The US military base in Putian is located in Yinowan City, Okinawa Prefecture. It has been criticized for a long time. The Japanese and US governments have previously agreed to relocate it to the border area of Nago City, but the Okinawa people strongly oppose it. I hope to completely move the base out of Okinawa.
For the relocation plan that the county people strongly opposed and the request to revoke the land reclamation permit on the ancient coast of the border area, Yucheng said that he did not stand in opposition and split with the central government at the beginning. I hope that the two sides can fully exchange views and show the intention to resolve through consultation.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also told the media on the morning of the 1st that he would seriously accept this result and will make efforts to revitalize Okinawa and reduce the burden on the base.
Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yan Yiwei said at a press conference on the 1st that the government's policy of relocating the US military base as soon as possible has not changed.
At the same time, he also expressed his intention to talk with Yucheng.
Yucheng will officially take office as governor of Okinawa Prefecture on the 4th of this month.
Since the mid-2000s, as China's demand for oilseeds has grown, Paul Thomas, a North Dakota farmer, has grown more and more soybeans in his fields.
This transition peaked this year, and he planted 1,600 acres of soybeans in 5,000 acres, reaching an unprecedented scale.
But Thomas and many farmers like him plan to switch to the staple crops of the former American agricultural areas in 2019: corn and wheat.
American farmers have grown more soybeans this year than corn for the first time in 35 years.
The reason why other food crops are planned is because American farmers are facing difficulties in selling soybeans in the context of US President Trump's trade war against China.
China usually buys about 60% of US-exported soybeans, but because of the trade war, it has purchased almost zero US soybeans in recent months, causing soybean prices to fall to a ten-year low.
Thomas plans to grow more wheat next year, hoping to earn more by reducing his dependence on crops that depend on Chinese demand.
Thomas said that soybean prices "bring us a painful blow."
He said that without the need to buy in China, the spot price of soybeans near his farm is $7.10 per bushel, while the price necessary to cover the cost is $8.50.
US farmers have set a record high soybean planting area this year, and the harvest is expected to set a record high.
At such a moment when it is easy to be hit, they have encountered the blow of a trade war.
In response to Trump's imposition of tariffs on imported Chinese goods, China imposed import tariffs on imported US soybeans in July.
The US Department of Agriculture will release the first estimated report on the planting area next year, which is expected to include consideration of the impact of tariffs.
It is expected that the estimate will confirm the expectation of private institutions that the sown area of soybeans will be reduced.
According to a report seen by Reuters, Informa Economics predicted on October 19 that the corn planting area will increase by 4% to 92.7 million acres (37.5 million hectares) in 2019, and the soybean planting area will decrease by 7% to 83 million acres.
Informa also expects the US wheat planting area to increase by 4%.
The soybean area planted before the implementation of retaliatory tariffs rose to 89.6 million acres this year, about 15 million acres higher than 10 years ago.
The corn planting area has increased by less than 5 million acres since 2008 to 89.1 million acres. This year, the wheat planting area is 47.8 million acres, close to the lowest level in 100 years.
Aron Carlson, president of the Illinois Corn Planting Association, has a total planting area of 3,600 acres. Nearly half of him is used to grow soybeans this year, but plans to cut back in the future.
He said that he may increase the corn planting area by up to 20% at his farm in northern Illinois; the state is the largest soybean growing state in the United States.
Soybeans produce less per acre than corn, but require less fertilizer, which makes soybeans generally less expensive to grow.
If farmers transfer to final-value corn, it may increase costs, but it will benefit some companies including Andersons Inc fertilizer sellers.
Andersons CEO Pat Bowe told Reuters that he expects the transfer of corn to be beneficial to fertilizer use.
Bayer is also expected to benefit from farmers switching to corn.

Xinhua International Review: Defending multilateralism, China's knowledge and action.
At a time when unilateralism is surging against the current, international rules and the multilateral order are affected.
To some extent, the confrontation between unilateralism and multilateralism has entered a critical period.
As a responsible big country, China has joined the international community to safeguard multilateralism and promote multilateralism with the concept of the general trend and the road of harmony and solid and powerful actions.
In the face of new situations and new challenges, China has made a loud voice on the development direction and path of multilateralism.
As State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in the speech of the general debate of the 73rd UN General Assembly, multilateralism in the new era should adhere to the goal of cooperation and win-win, based on the rule order, based on fairness and justice, and guided by effective action.
At the same time, China calls for the construction of a global development cooperation pattern with the United Nations as the core, North-South cooperation as the main channel, and South-South cooperation as the supplement, and calls on all parties to work together to build a community of human destiny.
China's thinking and voice reflect the mainstream voice of the international community.
As Espinosa, president of the 73rd session of the General Assembly, said, under the current situation, "the United Nations needs to promote multilateralism and maintain a rules-based international system more than ever."
International Monetary Fund President Lagarde said that the international community should continue to firmly safeguard the multilateral trading system, adhere to international trade rules, and resolve differences through consultation.
In recent years, with the adjustment of the global economic and political balance of power, some emerging markets and developing countries have risen to play a greater role in major international multilateral mechanisms, providing new development momentum for multilateralism that encounters headwinds.
Standing in this dimension, China advocates the construction of a large family rather than a small circle, insisting on the concept of multilateralism such as joint construction rather than win-win eating. It is in line with the trend of the times and is an inevitable choice to meet global challenges and solve world problems. It represents the common appeal of most countries in the world.
There are advanced concepts and more solid actions.
The "One Belt, One Road" initiative proposed by China has become the largest international cooperation platform.
China's international and regional cooperation initiatives such as the "One Belt, One Road," the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and the "16 + 1 Cooperation" promote international and regional cooperation, improve and supplement existing international systems and order, and bring innovative vitality to multilateral cooperation. Contribute to the development of the international order in a more just and reasonable direction.
As a defender of the international order and a practitioner of multilateralism, China's actions are becoming more and more powerful on the multilateral stage of the United Nations.
Mediation of international hotspots, response to climate change, participation in peacekeeping operations, poverty alleviation, and help other countries implement the 2030 sustainable development agenda.
As UN Secretary-General Guterres said, China has become an important pillar of multilateralism.
When the "trust deficit" facing the world intensifies, when the trend of populism and polarization rises, it is the world's most urgent need for multilateral cooperation.
At such a historical juncture, the international community needs to join hands, turn consensus into action, resolutely defend multilateralism, and jointly promote the building of a community of human destiny.

The fifth "Disabled Voice Month" arrives to pay attention to the issue of sex education for disabled adolescents - Zhongxin.com
In recent years, the topic of sex education for young people in China has been widely discussed, but the challenge for sex education for young people with disabilities is still very difficult.
Recently, a seminar on comprehensive education challenges and practical strategies for people with disabilities was held in Beijing.
How to educate disabled children and young people about sex has become an important topic in this seminar.
The "Report on Sexual Knowledge, Attitudes and Behavior of Disabled Children and Youth in China" released at the meeting showed that the proportion of sexually harassed and sexually assaulted children with disabilities was higher than that of healthy children.
For disabled children and adolescents, the society gives more attention to "sexual protection."
The purpose of this seminar is to discuss the promotion of comprehensive sexuality education for disabled children and adolescents in China from the aspects of family support, school education and institutional services, and to provide support for disabled children and adolescents from the source, so that they can enjoy the right to love like others.
Experts believe that the Chinese public's understanding of the disabled has always been at a level that is not deep enough.
Affected by traditional concepts and other factors, China's comprehensive education for disabled people, especially disabled children and adolescents, is not deep enough.
However, in recent years, with the support of UNESCO and the public welfare, the practice and realization of sexual and reproductive health education for the full-cycle development of disabled people in China has achieved gratifying development.
The "Report" shows that children and young people with visual impairment, hearing impairment, intellectual impairment and physical impairment will have more difficulties in obtaining sexual knowledge and understanding of intimate relationships than the average person, but on the whole they have developed to convenience and richness.
The "Seminar on Comprehensive Education Challenges and Practical Strategies for Persons with Disabilities" was hosted by the Shanghai People's Charity Foundation. The UNESCO Representative Office in China, the International Disability Alliance (France) Beijing Representative Office and the United Nations Population Fund Representative Office in China jointly supported the strategy of healthy China. In the context of the strategy, we will jointly explore the practice and realization of sexual and reproductive health education for all-round development of people with disabilities, and promote policy makers, educators, researchers, social service organizations, parents' representatives and other stakeholders in the field of special education and education. How to develop a comprehensive education and education for disabled children, how to develop a comprehensive education strategy for the disabled children and the disabled children's rights of comprehensive education;
Reuters, Beijing, September 30th - The People's Bank of China announced on Sunday that the net short-term outflow of foreign currency assets is scheduled to show that as of the end of August this year, the central bank's foreign currency against local currency forward contracts and futures contracts short positions for 12 consecutive months. Zero, there is still no long position in the month.
According to the central bank's previous data, as of the end of August last year, the central bank held a short position of foreign currency against local currency forward contracts and futures contracts of 6.044 billion US dollars, which was unchanged for the fourth consecutive month; the short position in SDR (special drawing rights) was 4.276 billion SDR.
Since then, the central bank's foreign exchange forward short position has been zero.
The central bank released the data for the first time at the end of March 2016; the data shows that at the end of February 2016, the central bank's foreign currency against local currency forward contracts and futures contracts long positions were 2.438 billion US dollars, and short positions were 28.9 billion US dollars.
The September data released at the end of October of the same year showed a net short increase of 16.401 billion US dollars to 45.301 billion US dollars.
The central bank has previously stated that the long-term and futures short positions of foreign currencies against local currencies mainly reflect the foreign exchange forward operations carried out by the central bank with commercial banks to meet the hedging needs of foreign currency liabilities of enterprises, and will continue to provide long-term hedging products according to the principle of real demand. The long-term operation of the central bank has less impact on the scale of future foreign exchange reserves.
On the evening of September 20 this year, on the K158 train, Qiao, a junior in Zhengzhou, went to Hebi by car.
A big man on the train bought a ticket without a seat, but took her seat: "Take a shot."
After a two-hour drive, the conductor advised him that he was still invalid for an hour.
In the end, a male passenger in the same car could not see the big man.
From the perspective of public opinion, although most of the final results are that the overlords are condemned by the public, punished by the public security department, and even included in the integrity blacklist, the public still feels that they are not "hating": Why can't the overlords be punished on the spot?
Why can't you stop its immoral or even illegal behavior on the spot, but can you punish it afterwards?
And for the unreasonable behavior of the "overlord," how is it just a male passenger who "sees the road" and pulls it up?
The main reason is that only long-distance trains are equipped with police, and short-distance trains are generally not; even if there are police, the police are also worried about the possible rogue reaction of the overlord and did not take forced removal measures.
The repeated incidents of hegemony have made people realize that the hegemon must be forcibly removed or even punished on the spot to be a deterrent.
This requires that our train passengers should dare to take strong measures in time. Trains without police should be equipped with police as soon as possible to prevent and crack down on illegal activities in a timely manner.
On October 1, the first day of the National Day holiday, the vehicles in the direction of Songpan, Maoxian County, Sichuan Beichuan Qiang Autonomous County, soared.
At 13 o'clock, the Beichuan traffic police received a call for help, saying that his family had a traffic accident in Songpan. Due to limited local medical conditions, it is urgently needed to be sent to Mianyang for treatment.
Just in time for Beichuan Tangjiashan Yan Sehu Huanhu Road to implement one-way traffic control, I would like to ask the traffic police to release 120 emergency vehicles.
After receiving the call for help, the police on duty quickly reported the situation to the brigade. After the captain Huang Xuemin had a simple understanding of the situation, he immediately arranged for the police on duty at the control point to contact the caller and asked for full escort work.
"At that time, there were more than 1,000 vehicles entering the control section. After contacting the 120 ambulance, it is expected that the time to arrive in Beichuan will be around 15: 00. We will immediately arrange for deployment."
Beichuan traffic police Yuli squadron leader Wei Wei introduced that emergency vehicles need to bypass the Tangjiashan Yan Sehu Huanhu Road, and the road is steep and narrow. In order to prevent the vehicles that have entered the road from driving in parallel, the traffic police will be in advance for one hour. At the beginning, middle and end of the road, the vehicle is subject to segmented control, and all passing drivers are reminded to give way to the wrong road for the ambulance.
Subsequently, the police of the drum squadron also temporarily stopped the vehicle from entering the control section and lined up the 120 ambulance that was about to arrive.
At 15 o'clock, a Sichuan U license ambulance drove into Beichuan. The Beichuan traffic police sent a police car to open the road and escorted the ambulance all the way into the control section.
It is understood that some places around the lake road can only pass by one car. The police temporarily controlled these places in advance to ensure the smooth passage of 120 emergency vehicles.
When I arrived at Shilibei Village in Huiping Township, there was a section of the road that could not be mistaken. So the traffic police contacted the village committee in advance, borrowed the village road to bypass, and banned social vehicles from entering.
"It took only 40 minutes for the Beichuan traffic police to receive 120 emergency vehicles and drive into the normal road of 302 provincial roads."
Wei Wei said that according to normal conditions, the entire passage time takes 4 hours.
"This arrangement has successfully won valuable treatment time for the patient."
It is reported that at 17: 20, critically ill patients were sent to Mianyang for treatment in time.
The number of confirmed deaths caused by the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami rose rapidly to 832, and the authorities are worried that the number will rise because it is difficult for rescuers to provide assistance to remote areas that have lost contact.

The two suspects are currently under review by the police.
The plainclothes police told reporters that who is suspicious in the crowd, this problem is very simple for the police.
"When you catch a thief, you will find that their eyes, looks and ordinary passengers are different. In addition to staring at people's pockets and backpacks, they also like to drill into the crowd instead of hiding from people."
The police also told reporters that suspects and other cars often have no purpose, like to wander in the station, find the object of pickpocketing before they will follow the car.
"These are all empirical talks. The plainclothes have been dry for a long time, and naturally they know."
In addition, the police also suggested that "the outer pocket is the most convenient and most likely to be stolen."

British Prime Minister Teresa May called on her party to unite to support her Brexit plan on Sunday, directly calling on critics to support it, saying that their hope to reach a free trade agreement is the core of her Brexit plan.
On September 30, 2018, in Birmingham, England, British Prime Minister Teresa May went to attend the Conservative Party Conference.

But she also received strong support from other ministers who supported Brexit. They "praised Teresa May as one of the most polite people." International Trade Minister Fox and Foreign Secretary Hunter also pointed their anger at the EU.
Teresa May's already fragile leadership was further under pressure this month, as the EU rejected part of the so-called "Chequers" plan.

"My message to my own party is let us work together to find the best agreement for the UK," said Teresa May.
Former British Foreign Secretary Johnson called Teresa May's plan "chaotic" and slammed her for not having confidence in Brexit.
He and former Brexit Minister Davis are pushing for a Canadian-style free trade agreement with the EU.
Teresa May said that this proposal will enable Northern Ireland to implement different tariff regulations, which is similar to the split of Northern Ireland from the United Kingdom.

This newspaper (internship reporter Li Yuyao) In recent years, there have been many incidents of unqualified plastic runways on campus.
To this end, the Ministry of Education issued a notice requesting that the new national standard must be implemented on the ground floor of the primary and secondary school synthetic materials delivered after November 1 this year.
The mandatory national standard "Synthetic Materials for Primary and Secondary Schools" was led by the Ministry of Education, and 26 research institutes and testing institutions participated in the drafting. After more than two years of revision, more than 100 expert meetings were organized during the period, and nationwide. Field visits and sampling inspections collected countless verification experiments on hundreds of enterprise products on the market.
Compared with the old national standard in 2005, the reporter found that the new national standard not only changed from "national recommendation standard" to "national mandatory standard," but also added a lot of content, including thickness requirements, physical properties, aging resistance, inorganic filler content requirements, anti-slip colloidal polymer content requirements, the limit of harmful substances in finished surface products, non-solid and solid raw materials, etc.
In particular, it is worth mentioning that the new national standard limits the harmful substances that may be produced in the construction of the campus plastic runway, from the original 7 items to 18 items, and stipulates the limit of volatile organic compounds in the runway after completion according to the home improvement standard.
For example, the "limit of harmful substances and odor requirements in cast-in-place and prefabricated surface finished products" clearly stipulates the release of harmful substances, requiring total volatile organic compounds not to be higher than 5 mg / m3, formaldehyde not to be higher than 0.4 mg / m3, carbon disulfide shall not be higher than 7 mg / m3, benzene shall not be higher than 0.1 mg / m3, and the odor shall not be higher than 3.
The new national standard also makes detailed provisions on the sampling requirements, inspection rules, and judgment rules of the plastic runway on the campus of primary and secondary schools.
In addition, the campus artificial lawn was also included in the compulsory testing scope of the national standard for the first time.
In the near future, all localities will carry out special work arrangements for the implementation of the new national standard, and submit the implementation of the new national standard to the Department of Physical Education, Health and Art Education of the Ministry of Education during the year.

To activate rural consumption, we must rely on the normalization mechanism to purify the market, guide the demand for healthy consumption, and enhance the sense of acquisition of farmers' consumption.
The data shows that the consumption potential of rural residents continues to be released. In the first half of this year, the retail sales of rural consumer goods increased by 10.5%, which is 1.3 percentage points higher than that of urban areas.
Visiting a poor village in a county in the west, there is only one convenience store in the village. When entering the store, some goods are familiar with each other. "Golden Dragon Fish" is marked as "Golden Dragon Oil," and "Wang Zai" has become "Wang Wei." There are many cottage "goods.
Over the years, similar phenomena have been frequently exposed. Some rural fake and shoddy goods are famous brands, with similar names, similar packaging, and false truths.
According to a consumer survey report released by a city in the west, the problem of super-fake goods in rural areas is serious. 66% of users have bought fake goods in the township offline supermarkets, of which food accounts for more than half.
The relevant departments have rectified the rural market and shouted every year. Why is "Li Ghost" still playing?
Different from the urban market, the awareness of farmers' rights protection is relatively weak. In addition, many rural areas are remote and are in blind spots that are beyond the reach of regulatory forces, so that fake and shoddy goods have a breeding ground.
A commodity bulls tube, some departments manage the price, some manage the production, some manage the market, cross functions, annual counterfeiting, centralized management of a gust of wind, fake goods escape the limelight, and slowly emerge, just finished the old fake, new fake and come out.
Lack of long-term supervision mechanism, the rural market is difficult to purify, the illegal cost is low, and the interests are large. As a result, some illegal traders have used the "going up and down the country" mentality, and some rural areas have become "waste markets."
From food and clothing to a well-off society, the majority of farmers are moving towards development-oriented consumption.
Recently, the Party Central Committee and the State Council issued the "Several Opinions on Perfecting the Mechanism of Promoting Consumption System to Further Stimulate the Consumption Potential of Residents," which proposed to promote the upgrading of rural residents' consumption ladder, with the aim of allowing the majority of farmers to "consume" and "willing to consume." Dare to consume, "so that rural consumption is really prosperous.
On the one hand, we must deepen reform, eliminate the shortcomings of market supervision and management, adapt to local conditions, improve food safety and product quality supervision networks, and constantly compress the space for rural counterfeiting and selling.
On the other hand, it is necessary to increase law enforcement and open up the supervision of "capillaries," and must not allow counterfeiting and shoddy to breed and spread in rural areas.
Severe punishment of potholes is the protection of farmers. No matter how hidden the counterfeiters are, they should not be the reason for the breeding of fake and shoddy goods. The relevant departments should clearly define their duties, the grassroots supervision force sinks, and which link is problematic. It is necessary to be held accountable, so that counterfeiters and counterfeiters have nowhere to hide.
Strictly control market access, implement strict qualification examination for producers and operators, check the market circulation, let the products come to the right way, go to the clear road, find ways from the source and the roots, let the legal dealers operate with peace of mind, let the farmers buy at ease.
To activate rural consumption, we must guide the demand for healthy consumption.
With the upgrading of consumption, many farmers not only pursue eating and eating well, but also pursue high-quality life such as culture and health. They cannot compare the rural market with "low quality" and "cheap" paintings.
This requires promoting the extension of e-commerce to the vast rural areas, unblocking the two-way linkage sales channels between urban and rural areas, promoting the integration of offline industrial development platforms and online e-commerce trading platforms, supporting the expansion of new consumer formats to rural markets; and promoting qualified towns and villages to combine business logistics with leisure agriculture, rural tourism, product processing, etc.; improve the rural modern circulation network system, optimize the integration of stock facilities resources, and effectively reduce rural circulation costs.
Create a clear and reassuring market environment for the countryside, so that farmers' consumption is not worried, and rural consumption can become more and more prosperous, in order to enhance the sense of acquisition and happiness of farmers' consumption.
From November 1st, China will reduce the MFN tax rate for some commodities, and the total tariff level will fall to 7.5%.
According to the decision of the 26th executive meeting of the State Council, the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council issued a notice on the 30th to reduce the MFN tax rate for some commodities from November 1, 2018.
According to the "Notice of the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council on Reducing Import Tariffs on Some Commodities," in order to adapt to industrial upgrading, reduce corporate costs and meet the needs of the masses for multi-level consumption, from November 1 this year, reduce the MFN tax rate for some industrial products and other commodities.
There are 1,585 tax items for tax reduction commodities, accounting for about 19% of the total number of tax items in China. The average tax rate dropped from 10.5% to 7.8%, and the average decline was 26%.

At the same time, with the reduction of the total tariff level, especially the import tariffs on medicines and consumer goods, the tax rate of import duties on imported goods will be lowered accordingly.
In order to implement the decision-making arrangements of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, China has implemented zero tariffs on most imported drugs since May 1 this year. Since July 1, it has reduced import tariffs on automobiles and parts and some consumer goods, and implemented information technology. The agreement expands the third step of the product to reduce taxes.
The reporter learned from the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council that since the beginning of this year, after several consecutive independent adjustments, China's total tariff level will fall from 9.8% in the previous year to 7.5%, with an average decline of 23%.
Appropriate reduction of tariffs will help promote the balanced development of foreign trade and promote a higher level of opening up to the outside world. It will also help to make overall use of both international and domestic resources and promote domestic supply-side structural reforms.
The relevant person in charge of the committee said that this year marks the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up. Taking the initiative to reduce the overall level of tariffs is a practical action to implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the Boao Forum for Asia. It is also an important measure for China to further expand opening up and actively expand imports in accordance with its own high-quality development needs. This action and initiative show that China will unswervingly pursue a mutually beneficial and win-win open strategy, while enhancing its own development momentum, it also allows China to better benefit the world.
On September 29th, the public brand conference of "Huanxiang People" agricultural products in Huanxian County, Gansu Province was held in Nankai District, Tianjin.
Red Army millet, black beans, mountain children's songs black goat, hardcover bitter tea, paper-cut shadow book, pure handmade slippers... A piece of beautifully packaged agricultural products is placed neatly on the booth. They have a common brand name called "Huanxiang People."
"Building the regional brand of" Huanxiang People "has effectively solved the bottleneck of the development of the agricultural products of Huanxian County, which is scattered, small and weak, and has become a powerful carrier for poverty alleviation." On the 29th, the "Huanxiang People" agricultural products regional public brand conference was held in Nankai District, Tianjin.
Huanxian is located at the junction of the three provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu and Ningxia. As "the advanced county of national grain production," "the hometown of small grains in China" and "the hometown of Chinese shadow," it has a long history and abundant resources.
Lamb meat, yellow rice wine, chop noodles, soft swallow noodles and other local snacks are often remembered by tourists in other places.
With the continuous improvement of China's urbanization level, the urban population is increasing rapidly, and a large number of rural young people leave their hometown to start urban life.
Yang Qiaojia, an expert in Chinese agricultural brand research, said: "Now that urban life is fast and stressful, more and more people are beginning to miss the rural life of their childhood. However, the most beautiful memory is the countryside." The brand design is named after the nostalgia and nostalgia of the people who are drifting around the county. "
Huanxian has special climatic conditions, long sunshine time, large temperature difference between day and night, and unique conditions for planting small grains.
The territory is rich in more than 20 kinds of small grains. It is the hometown of small grains in China. The output ranks first in Gansu, and the quality is in the forefront of the country.
Wang Xiaoli is a girl from Huanxian County who went to school in Tianjin. She participated in the promotion meeting as a volunteer. She said: "The people in her hometown are the closest, the taste of her hometown is the most beautiful, and the 'Huanxiang People' brand has evoked us. Too much nostalgia, memories, nostalgia is the food of the time, I hope that the 'Huanxiang People' brand will go further and further and further and bigger."
Dr. Tan Bin, a researcher at the Scientific Research Institute of the National Food and Material Reserve Bureau, said that through the detection of more than 900 sets of indicator data, the testing data of buckwheat, bitter, black beans and other agricultural products in Huanxian County are outstanding, and many physiological active substances in the grains are higher than the standard data. "Huanxiang people" have the inherent advantage of grabbing the domestic high-end grain market.
Chai Chun, secretary of the county party committee of Huanxian County, said that through the release of the "Huanxiang People" brand, it can further enhance the quality, standardization and scale of innovation and development of high-quality agricultural products in Huanxian County, which is conducive to shaping a good overall image of agricultural products in Huanxian County, and rapidly enhance visibility, competitiveness and added value.
Canada's gross domestic product (GDP) in July increased by 0.2% compared with the previous month, and the growth rate was higher than expected, which caused the market to expect the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates next month.
If it does raise interest rates, this will be the fifth time the central bank has raised interest rates in a little more than a year.
Analysts interviewed by Reuters had previously estimated an increase of 0.1%.
Statistics Canada said on Friday that 12 of the 20 industries achieved growth.
The reason why the data is worth noting is that the central bank predicted earlier this month that temporary factors may drag down the third quarter GDP data.
Bank of Canada President Poloz promised on Thursday that the central bank will continue to raise interest rates gradually and will pay close attention to economic data.
The Bank of Canada's next interest rate decision will be announced on October 24.
Due to the strengthening of the Canadian economy and the unemployment rate is close to a record low, the Bank of Canada has raised interest rates four times since July 2017.
Stephen Brown, a senior Canadian economist at Kaitou Macro, said that the country's third-quarter GDP growth rate is expected to reach about 2%.
"This will be higher than the 1.5% expected by the Bank of Canada, and will be another reason for the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates next month," he said in a report.
Overnight index swaps show that the market's estimate of the Bank of Canada's interest rate hike in October rose from 76.46% to 78.27%.
Han Dynasty's first joint inspection of the Hanjiang estuary in 65 years
The South Korean Defense Ministry confirmed on the 5th that the ROK and the DPRK launched a joint inspection of the waters of the Hanjiang and Linjin Rivers.
The initiative is a preliminary preparation for the free navigation of private vessels on both sides.
The South Korean Defense Ministry's briefing to the media on the same day showed that this was the first joint inspection of the Hanjiang estuary since the signing of the Korean War armistice agreement in 1953.
The ROK and the DPRK signed a military agreement in September this year and agreed to jointly inspect the waters such as the mouth of the Han River in November to ensure environmental protection and development of tourism in the waters in the future.
In October, the ROK and the DPRK planned a joint inspection of the waters in the general military meeting.
On November 5, the joint inspection of the waters of the ROK and the DPRK was officially launched.
The joint delegation was composed of 20 members from the Korean military and experts.
According to the South Korean Defense Ministry, during the inspection, both personnel did not carry weapons and prohibited the use of words and deeds that stimulated each other.
"Because there is no military demarcation line near the mouth of the sea, the area was once an unexpected high-risk area, but through joint inspection, it will become a new peaceful area in the future."
The waters jointly inspected by the ROK and the DPRK have a total length of about 70 kilometers and a total area of about 280 square kilometers.
According to the Ministry of National Defense of the Republic of Korea, the ROK will send six research vessels to detect the depth of seawater and provide basic information for the safe navigation of the waters; after the investigation is completed, navigation maps will be provided for the movement of private vessels.
The ROK and the DPRK held a summit meeting in Pyongyang in October 2007 and reached an agreement on the joint use of the Hanjiang and Linjinjiang estuaries. However, the subsequent negotiations were stranded due to the tense situation on the peninsula.
According to the military agreement signed by the ROK and the DPRK in September, the vessels of the two sides will need to inform each other in advance before sailing in the common waters.
Chinanews.com, November 5th, according to the website of the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia on the 4th, recently, Chinese citizens Guo Yuqin and Mao Runxin lost their connection during the Mongolian tour.
It is understood that the two are members of the Blue Sky Rescue Team. On October 19, the two contacted relatives and friends in China and said that they would soon enter the mountains near Kusugur Lake and share their location through WeChat. After that, they lost contact and were suspected to have gone to no-man's land.
The Chinese Embassy in Mongolia has always attached great importance to the protection of the legitimate rights and interests and security of Chinese citizens in Mongolia and attaches great importance to consular protection and assistance.
After learning that the above two tourists lost the news, the embassy immediately launched the emergency plan, and strive to seize the golden rescue time and fully carry out the work.
The embassy maintained close communication with the family members of the parties, assisted the family members to immediately report the case to the Mongolian police, and provided the family with a translation list to choose from.
The embassy first met with the head of the Mongolian Ministry of External Relations, the General Administration of Police and the General Administration of Emergency Situations to inform the relevant situation, and asked the Mongolian side to carry out search and rescue as soon as possible, and to maintain close communication with the Mongolian side throughout the search and rescue process to ensure timely grasp the latest progress.
At the same time, the embassy assisted the family members to issue notices in Mongolia, and extensively mobilized overseas Chinese and Chinese-funded enterprises in Mongolia to actively participate in the search, provide effective clues, and provide relevant assistance to many blue sky rescue team members who went to Mongolia to assist in the rescue.
Under the strong promotion of the embassy, the Mongolian side sent a rescue team for the first time and promised to waive the search and rescue fee.
The Mongolian Police General Administration and the General Administration of Emergency Situations instructed the police and emergency departments of the province of Kusugur to fully search and rescue.
Since Kusugur Lake is located at the junction of northern Mongolia and Russia, it is remote, sparsely populated, and transportation and communication are extremely inconvenient. At present, Mongolia has entered a severe winter, and the temperature is as low as minus 20 degrees. The local police and emergency departments have overcome tremendous difficulties, mobilized almost all police forces, and mobilized local herdsmen to carry out carpet search and rescue around the two-person lost location.
At the same time, in response to the special situation of pastoral areas, the Mongolian side has been publishing notices through the broadcast cycle for many days.
The relevant staff of the domestic blue sky rescue team have also come to Mongolia and Mongolia to actively participate in the rescue.
The safety of the two disconnected personnel has always touched our hearts.
So far, the two have been out of touch for more than ten days. The embassy has received some clues, but they have not found two people. At present, the search and rescue operation is still in progress.
The embassy will always follow the principle of "people-oriented," continue to pay attention to this matter, promote the Mongolian side to continue to search and rescue, and provide maximum assistance to the families of the parties.
The Embassy appeals to compatriots and enterprises in Mongolia. If you know the relevant clues, please contact the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia at the first time.
