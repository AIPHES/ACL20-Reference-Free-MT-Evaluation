According to British media, Admiral William Moran, deputy secretary of naval operations, said that even as the U.S. Navy is revitalizing its efforts to deal with an increasingly worrying Russia on both sides of the Atlantic, the United States continues to focus on the Asia-Pacific region, which the Pentagon has expanded to include the Indian Ocean-Asia-Pacific Ocean.
The United States has listed China and Russia as strategic competitors in its new defense strategy released at the beginning of the year, the website of Jane's Defense Weekly reported on September 24.
The U.S. Navy has since restored the Second Fleet in order to more directly counter Russian activities.
The moves raised some questions and concerns among allies and analysts that the U.S. Navy could move away from the "Asia-Pacific rebalancing" strategy that marked the Obama administration, the report said.
But Admiral Moran said the U.S. Navy's focus remains on the western Pacific.
"For us, there has been no significant change," he said at a round-table discussion called "Addressing the High Seas Challenge," hosted by the U.S. National Bureau of Asian Studies in Washington on January 24, 2018.
"The focus is still on rebalancing, shifting the center of gravity or whatever you want to describe it." Moran said.
But he acknowledged that the United States has close ties to Europe.
"We will continue to focus on growth on the West Coast and balance what we can do." he said.
While Moran noted that overall policy on Russia falls within the purview of the U.S. defense secretary, he warned: "The Russians may face demographic and economic challenges, but history has proved that they can be very tough if we clash with them."
Admiral Moran said that as part of a U.S. comeback against Russia, China and other competitors, the U.S. Navy is dynamically deploying troops into a "new mode of operations," which will help keep adversaries off guard about where U.S. carrier battle groups or other assets will be deployed at any given time and place.
"Our Navy and Marine Corps support it-the concept of operational unpredictability, not being in the same place over and over again, almost like clockwork-that's our approach." he said.
The first to try the new approach was the Harry Truman carrier battle group, whose early deployment included working visits to the port and patrols in areas that usually only pass, the report said.
Moran said the U.S. Navy is now working to ensure allies know that the warships will still patrol traditional areas, and is also addressing logistical and family liaison issues for the new deployment process.
The commander of the Royal Australian Navy, Lieutenant General Michael Nunan, also spoke at the event, saying Australian troops could work seamlessly with the U.S. aircraft carrier battle group.
He said the situation would continue as the Royal Australian Navy plans to procure nine more frigates equipped with the "Zeus Shield" combat system.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's Itozhong Commercial on Friday recognized a US $1.3 billion impairment loss on its investment in China's CITIC shares, writing down its largest corporate investment deal because of trade tensions between China and the United States.
A man walks past the headquarters of the company in Tokyo, Japan, in May 2016.
Meatball, for its part, said the trade war had hit Gao Hong, its U.S. grain division, and that it had suspended financial transactions in agriculture.
Some Japanese heavy equipment manufacturers, telecoms companies and others have warned of the impact of trade frictions between China and the United States when they report their latest results, and now they have joined the ranks.
The United States and China impose tariffs on each other's hundreds of billions of dollars of goods, and U.S. President Trump has threatened to extend the tax to all more than US $500 billion of Chinese goods exported to the United States if the dispute is not resolved.
Tsuyoshi Hachimura, Itozhong's commercial finance chief, said the trade dispute could have a greater impact on China's economy next year.
Itozhong Commercial and Thailand's Bu Bee Group invested US $10 billion in CITIC in 2015 to take a 20% stake in it.
Hachimura said Itozhong reported a loss of 143.3 billion yen (US $1.3 billion) on the stake because it did not think CITIC's share price would recover in the near future.
Itozhong maintained its profit forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019 at 500 billion yen.
In July, China imposed a 25% import tariff on U.S. soybeans to counter Washington's move in trade frictions.
"Our grain business has been hit by trade frictions between the United States and China," said Yanhong, the finance chief.
He said Gaohong had stopped financial transactions in his own account since September.
Gaohong spokesman Pat Burke said in a draft statement on Friday that the company's move was "in accordance with internal policy restrictions and due to a lack of market opportunities."
He also said the suspension of financial transactions would not lead to fewer jobs.
Meatball maintained its annual profit forecast of 230 billion yen, helped by pulp and paper and power generation.
Sumitomo Commercial on Thursday reported a 16% increase in profit between April and September, stressing that "U.S. trade problems with China have led to an uncertain outlook."
Mitsubishi raised its annual profit forecast to a record level on Friday due to higher coking coal production and higher commodity prices such as oil and coal.
Mitsubishi also announced a new business plan to boost its profit to 900 billion yen (US $7.98 billion) in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022 from an estimated 640 billion yen this year.
Voting in the U.S. midterm elections has entered the countdown, according to a comprehensive report on November 5.
On November 4, President Trump and his Democratic opponents actively "urged votes" to their core voters.
Both major parties point out that voter turnout will be the key to shaping the election.
Forty-eight hours before the U.S. popular vote, Trump was reportedly busy attending the Republican candidate's momentum-building event, while former President Barack Obama went to Indiana to platform Joe Donnelly, the Democratic federal Senate candidate who was in a hurry, and called out his final pre-election appeal to the crowd.
On November 4, Trump went to the platform for Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp in Megang, Georgia, and said, "You have to go to the polling place on Tuesday, you have to vote."
"The contrast in this election could not have been clearer."
Voters' political enthusiasm has risen to a rare peak, with early voting far more than usual in some states.
Successive U.S. presidents face their first midterm elections, and his party tends to have fewer members of Congress.
While the Democratic federal House race remains dominant, Republicans could benefit from economic assessments and Trump's strict focus on border security, according to a new poll released by the Washington Post and ABC News on Thursday.
Polls show that registered voters like more Democratic House candidates than Republicans, 50% to 43%, but are still down from a 14-point lead in August.
A separate poll by NBC and the Wall Street Journal also showed Democrats still seven points ahead of Republicans.
"When people don't tell the truth, when words no longer represent anything, it's bound to have bad results," Obama is understood to have told the crowd at Senator Donoli's rally.
Democracy can't work when people can only lie to themselves. "
"The only way to stop the behavior of these Republicans now is you and your vote." "
Democrats face their most difficult election in decades in the Senate, where Republicans now hold more than half of the 51 seats.
But the House race is more favorable, and Democrats need to win 23 more seats to take control of the 435-seat House.
Analysts at FiveThirtyEight.com, a predictive election website, estimate that Democrats have an 85% chance of winning the House.

For the first time, he has clarified the characteristics and advantages of the new political party system, emphasized the correct handling of the relationship between consistency and diversity, and deeply revealed that the true meaning of people's democracy lies in good consultation, and that the affairs of the people are discussed by the Chinese people, and that the latest theory of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) is based on the logic of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
Wang Yang stressed that the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) at all levels should take theoretical study and discussion as an opportunity to further find out the weak links and shortcomings in the work of the CPPCC, and work hard to strengthen and improve and seek breakthroughs.
We should strengthen the construction of the Party in the CPPCC system in an all-round way to ensure that the decision-making and deployment of the Central Committee of the Party are fully implemented in the work of the CPPCC.
We should strengthen ideological and political leadership, improve the system, procedures and mechanisms for the "two-way development" of governance and consensus-building, and implement ideological and political leadership in all aspects and the whole process of the performance of our duties.
We should focus on the central task of carrying out our duties with due diligence, better obey and serve the overall situation of the Party and the state, improve the quality of construction and management, and enhance the effectiveness of the performance of our duties.
We should strengthen the construction of the CPPCC itself, do a good job in the education and training of members and cadres, give full play to the basic role of the special committee, and strengthen the foundation for the CPPCC to carry out its duties.
We should strengthen guidance on the work of the local CPPCC, take the direction, do demonstrations, solve difficult problems, and raise the overall level of the work of the CPPCC.
In order to study and implement Xi Jinping's thought of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era and the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Party, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) system has been carrying out important ideological study and discussion activities of General Secretary Xi Jinping on strengthening and improving the work of the CPPCC since May, holding eight district symposiums and seven symposiums of experts and scholars, and identifying 18 key topics and six basic theoretical topics. A total of 7.938 million members of the CPPCC at all levels and 279,000 government officials have participated in the study and discussion, forming more than 36,000 research papers.
BEIJING, Nov 5 (Wang Xiaoyan) Under the current wave of "mass entrepreneurship and mass innovation", more and more science and technology companies are beginning to attach importance to patent research and development and related protection work, dig deep into the potential value of patents and occupy market leadership.
Similarly, there are also many science and technology enterprises in the licensing of patented technology, the use of patented technology and other aspects of the infringement storm.
At the end of 2017, Tan Wei, He Zhanghong and Lai Bin, from Guangdong Province, filed a complaint with the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court against Beijing Xiaoorange Technology Co. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Little Orange Technology), the developer of the "drip travel" APP, the operator drip travel technology Co. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as drip travel) and the seller Guangdong Pacific Internet Information Services Co. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Guangdong Pacific) on the grounds of patent infringement.
The three plaintiffs requested the court to order that the three defendants immediately stop the manufacture, sale, promise of sale and use of the plaintiff's patent.
On October 30, 2018, the China Referee Instrument Network published the "First Instance Civil Order of Tan Wei, He Zhanghong and Beijing Xiaoorange Technology Co. Ltd. and other disputes over infringement of patent rights for inventions", revealing the details of some of the cases in which APP was sued for patent infringement.
The three plaintiffs held that the patentee and inventor of the patent for the "mobile terminal-based carpool service system and method", and that the whole operation process of the application of the "downwind car" in the "drip travel" APP corresponded to the technical plan for the patent protection involved, which constituted a patent infringement.
However, during the court's ruling, Xiao Orange Technology held that Guangdong Pacific was not a suitable defendant. It only provided free downloads of the APP "drip travel" on the Internet, did not implement the patent method involved, there was no direct or indirect infringement and should not be listed as a defendant in the case.
Second, the place of infringement in this case is not in Guangdong.
According to the law, the place of infringement of the patent involved should be the place where the patent method involved was fully implemented. Therefore, an objection was raised to the jurisdiction of the court and a request was made to transfer the case to the court of the defendant's place of residence, the Beijing Intellectual Property Court, for trial.
The Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court held that the defendant, Guangdong Pacific, had provided the alleged infringement of APP products on its network platform, and that it was not inappropriate for the plaintiff to list the defendant, Guangdong Pacific, as a defendant.
And the defendant Guangdong Pacific domicile in Guangzhou, under the jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The defendant, Xiao Orange Science and Technology, argued that the case should be transferred to the Beijing Intellectual Property Court for trial. On the basis of insufficient evidence, he rejected the objection raised by the defendant, Xiao Orange Technology Co. Ltd., to the jurisdiction of the case, and borne the cost of accepting the case of jurisdictional objection.
At present, the other trial of the case has not yet been announced, the reporter will also pay close attention to the follow-up details of the drip travel patent infringement case.
Interview with the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Federal Scientific and Industrial Research Organization: Australia-China scientific and technological cooperation has achieved remarkable results
"China's science and technology have developed rapidly over the past few decades, and Australia and China can achieve fruitful results by working together in the field of science." he said.
Larry Marshall, chief executive of the Australian Federal Organization for Scientific and Industrial Research, told China News Agency in an interview in Beijing that from combating climate change to cooperation in the "Sky Eye" project, Australia-China cooperation in the field of science and technology has shown great vitality.
As the largest national scientific research institution in the Australian Federation, CSIRO has made a number of innovative research achievements in the fields of oceans, energy, biology, materials and astronomy that have attracted worldwide attention.
CSIRO has maintained close cooperation with scientific research institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
"It's a lasting friendship that contains a tradition of trust in partners and long-term cooperation." Marshall said.
In May this year, China's 500-meter spherical radio telescope, the "China Sky Eye", installed the world's first 19-beam L-band receiver.
The most advanced 19-beam feed receiver in the world has been jointly developed by Chinese and Australian scientists.
Mr Marshall said the successful development of the receiver was based on years of technical accumulation by CSIRO, which would increase the speed of FAST travel by five to six times when it was launched, while also expanding more scientific observation targets.
"This is a force that CSIRO has contributed to FAST."
In addition to the above-mentioned cooperation, CSIRO also has close cooperation with Chinese scientific research institutions in the construction of square-kilometer array radio telescopes, the development of new fuel technologies, energy conservation and emission reduction.
"In the past, scientific research has tended to focus on the problems of the past century, and more scientific research is needed to solve the problems ahead." he said.
Marshall believes that Australia and China are complementary in the field of scientific development, while both countries face a series of challenges in their development.
For example, extreme weather is frequent around the world, droughts and floods have led to reduced food production, and food shortages have seriously affected human development.
At the same time, problems such as population explosion, aging and chronic diseases are also serious challenges.
"The cooperation between Australia and China in recent years has been mainly focused on solving these current problems." he said.
Marshall said that the International Southern Hemisphere Marine Research Center, jointly built by CSIRO and the Qingdao National Laboratory of Marine Science and Technology, focuses on observing El Ni ñ o and La Ni ñ a phenomena, studying the relationship between the two and extreme weather, and establishing early warning facilities for extreme weather. The new varieties of cereals developed by CSIRO and the Chinese Academy of Sciences to overcome extreme weather can also alleviate food shortages caused by extreme weather.
"In the current environment, scientific and technological innovation is difficult to complete on its own, requires very high costs and there are many problems to be solved, so cooperation is particularly important today." he said.
Mr Marshall said the closer the cooperation, the more likely it was to make a breakthrough, which was the significance of strengthening cooperation between Australia and China under the "one-way" framework.
"Strengthening bilateral cooperation is mainly scientific and technological cooperation for us." he said.
Marshall said, for example, that CSIRO has recently developed a gold purification method that does not use cyanide. Because the traditional cyanide gold purification method is very harmful to the environment, many countries are hoping to find a way to purify gold that is less environmentally polluted.
"We are willing to introduce this technology into China, which is one of the results of our participation in the 'Belt and Road' cooperation." he said.
On the 29th, the 2018 Baoji Silk Road Tourism Promotion and Project Cooperation Fair was held in Urumqi City, Xinjiang. While enjoying the achievements of Baoji's development, participants could also enjoy local food and feel the heavy history and culture of the region.
In the month before the event, Baoji carried out a series of high-density and large-scale tourism publicity and promotion activities in eight cities along the Silk Road, including Tianshui, Pingliang, Lanzhou, Yinchuan, Guyuan, Xining, Zhangye and Hami, laying a good foundation for the success of the 2018 Baoji Silk Road Tourism Promotion and Project Cooperation Fair.

It is the second largest city in Shaanxi Province, the deputy central city of the Guantian Economic Area and the Guanzhong Plain urban agglomeration, and an important node city along the "Belt and Road" initiative.
In recent years, Baoji City has continued to enhance the five functions of industrial clusters, logistics hubs, comprehensive services, open highlands and humanistic cohesion, and has accelerated the promotion of catch-up and high-quality development.
At the meeting, the Baoji Tourism Development Committee and the Urumqi Tourist Office signed a strategic cooperation agreement on tourism between the two places.
At the same time, a number of travel agencies in Xinjiang have signed tourism cooperation agreements with the Baoji Dashuchuan Tourist Scenic Area, the Famen Temple Buddha Cultural Scenic Area, the Taibai Mountain Tourist Scenic Area and the Guanshan Prairie Scenic Area.
Chen Hongwei, head of the Market Promotion Section of the Baoji Tourism Development Committee, said: "In Xinjiang, some tourism resources complement Baoji. We have come all the way to promote tourism to Xinjiang, mainly introducing humanistic Baoji, gourmet Baoji and natural scenery, and selecting more than 500 photos to let merchants feel the beautiful scenery of Baoji."
With emphasis on tourism resources, tourism projects and tourist routes, Baoji promoted the overall image of Baoji tourism, high-quality tourism products and fine tourism industry projects in an all-round way through the broadcast of tourism publicity films, the promotion of cultural tourism resources and projects, the holding of tourism photography exhibitions, the production of publicity exhibitions, the distribution of publicity materials and the docking of tourism cooperation and exchanges, the consolidation of the source market in Xinjiang, the comprehensive singing of the "Look at China to Baoji" brand, and the enhancement of Baoji City's influence and tourism experience in the northwest region to attract more tourists from Xinjiang.
Feng Xu, deputy director of the Baoji City Merchants Bureau, said: "At this event, departments at all levels, counties, districts and development zones in Baoji City actively docked and negotiated, and coordinated the implementation of a large number of good projects and large-scale projects.
So far, 41 signed projects have been implemented, involving a total amount of 26.043 billion yuan. "
In recent years, Baoji has continued to enhance the five functions of industrial clusters, logistics hubs, comprehensive services, open highlands and humanistic cohesion around the goal of building an international city, a famous equipment manufacturing city, a famous historical and cultural city and a beautiful and happy city along the "One Belt and One Road" initiative, so as to accelerate the pursuit and transcendence and high-quality development.
Regional gross domestic product reached 218 billion yuan in 2017, an increase of 8.7%.
He has won more than 20 national honors, including the National Civilized City, the National Ecological Garden City and the China Habitat Environment Award.
Yan Nai-min, a member of the Standing Committee of the Urumqi Municipal Committee and deputy mayor of the Urumqi Municipal Committee, said that Urumqi, as a major town on the New North Road on the Silk Road, has special geographical advantages. Since ancient times, it has been an important channel linking the north and south of Tianshan, communicating Xinjiang with the Mainland, and connecting China with Central Asia, West Asia and Europe. It is an important window for China to open to the west and economic and cultural exchanges with foreign countries, and has a good investment environment.
This event focuses on equipment manufacturing, logistics trade and tourism industry. With the sincerity of seeking common opportunities for development and discussing cooperation plans, it has made a great difference in Urumqi.
At the forum, local businessmen in Xinjiang signed six projects with Baoji counties and districts, involving a total of 3.25 billion yuan.
On the same day, representatives of the Kyrgyz Visa Office in Urumqi, representatives of the Russian New Siberian Law Co. Ltd., the Tajik Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Urumqi, and representatives of the Russian Tatarstan Chamber of Commerce attended the meeting.

Whether the vitality of the old industrial base can be re-stimulated and released, affecting the heart of the general secretary.
North Korean Foreign Minister Lee Yong-ho told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were deepening North Korea's distrust of the United States and that North Korea could not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Lee Yong-ho said North Korea had taken a "very friendly approach" over the past year, including halting missile and nuclear tests, dismantling nuclear test sites and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we have not seen any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"If we do not trust the United States, we have no confidence in our national security, and in such a situation, we cannot unilaterally give up our weapons first." he said.
While Lee Yong-ho was repeating North Korea's complaints about the United States' opposition to "phased" denuclearization, his speech was significant because there was no complete rejection of unilateral denuclearization, as North Korea had done before.
Lee Yong-ho referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Trump on June 12, when Kim Jong-un agreed to efforts to "denuclearize the Korean peninsula" and Trump promised to protect North Korea's security.
North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says it must give up its nuclear weapons first.
The United States has also refused to ease demands for international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on'denuclearization first 'and has increased pressure on sanctions to achieve its goals in a high-pressure manner, and has even refused to issue a'declaration on the end of the war'," Li said.
"The idea that sanctions can make us kneel for mercy is that people who don't know us are daydreaming.
But the problem is that such continued sanctions are deepening our mistrust. "
Li Yong-ho did not mention the plans for a second special gold conference mentioned by the U.S. president at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, he highlighted three meetings between Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in over the past five months and said: "If the other side of denuclearization is South Korea, not North Korea, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will not become so deadlocked."
China has announced a reduction in import tariffs on 1,585 tariff lines from November 1, 2018.
Since the beginning of this year, China has taken the initiative to reduce import tariffs.
On May 1 this year, the tax on drugs was reduced in an all-round way, adjusting the import tariffs on 28 tax items, including all ordinary drugs, including anti-cancer drugs, alkaloid drugs with anti-cancer effects and Chinese-made drugs actually imported, to zero.
At the same time, the value-added tax burden on the production and import of anti-cancer drugs has been greatly reduced.
On July 1, taxes were reduced on cars and spare parts for 218 tax items.
After tax, China's total car tax rate has been lower than the average of developing countries and is in line with the actual situation of China's auto industry.
The tax reduction will promote the restructuring of the industry and the optimal allocation of resources, accelerate the survival of winners and losers, help to improve the quality of products and services, and is expected to promote the adjustment of car prices to a certain extent and give consumers more benefits.
On July 1, taxes were reduced on daily consumer goods for 1,449 tax items.
The tax reduction on consumer goods is closely related to the needs of the people for a better life.
The tax reduction is not only large in number but also strong, with an average tax reduction of 56%.
Tax cuts on daily consumer goods directly benefit consumers and promote the competitiveness of domestic industries.
On November 1, tax cuts will be imposed on industrial goods such as electromechanical equipment, spare parts and raw materials for 1,585 tax items.
An appropriate reduction in import tariffs on some of the industrial goods that are urgently needed in China will attract more foreign investment, help to increase effective domestic supply and help to upgrade industries. At the same time, it will help enterprises to allocate resources worldwide, reduce production costs and reduce the pressure on the domestic environment.
The above four independent tax cuts, as well as the third step of the tax cuts implemented on July 1 this year in accordance with the outcome of the negotiations on the expansion of the scope of the information technology agreement, will reduce China's overall tariff level to 7.5% from 9.8% the previous year, according to a person in charge of the office of the Committee on Tariffs and Tariffs of the State Council.
The overall level of adjusted tariffs is slightly higher than that of the European Union, lower than that of most developing countries, and is at a medium-low level, which is basically in line with China's status as a developing country and stage of development.
The person in charge introduced that the total tariff level, as one of the important indicators of China's openness in the field of trade in goods, should be in line with the stage of China's economic development and reflect the characteristics of the times.
China's trade in goods is the largest in the world and already has an economic base for further expansion and opening-up, but there is still a gap between the quality and efficiency of trade development and that of developed economies. Therefore, the overall tariff level should be appropriately reduced.
Tariffs are a means of compliance protection. The level of tariffs should be in line with the competitiveness of the industry. Benign competition should be encouraged. Excessive protection is not conducive to industrial development and quality improvement.
The adjustment of tariff rate should take into account the needs of production and consumption demand.
Emphasis has been placed on reducing the commodity tax rate, which has large domestic demand and is conducive to industrial transformation and upgrading, and efforts have been made to increase the import of products with special advantages where the needs of the people are concentrated, continuously enhancing the sense of access of enterprises and the public, and meeting the needs of upgrading the industrial structure and consumption structure.
The intensity of tax reduction should take into account the affordability of fiscal revenue and industrial development.
In the choice of specific tax reduction commodities and tax reduction ranges, we should coordinate the two domestic and foreign markets, the upper and lower reaches, and the relationship between production and consumption, so as to maintain the steady and positive momentum of China's economic development.
The person in charge stressed that this year marks the 40th anniversary of reform and opening-up, and that China's initiative to reduce the overall level of import tariffs is a major step taken in accordance with China's own needs to achieve high-quality development, which is conducive to the overall use of both international and foreign resources, the improvement of the quality of the domestic supply system and the meeting of the needs of the people for the upgrading of consumption.
This action and initiative show that China will unswervingly pursue a mutually beneficial and win-win opening-up strategy, firmly support economic globalization, resolutely safeguard the principle of free trade and the multilateral trading system with the WTO at its core, continue to draw the impetus for development from opening up to the world and make China's development better benefit the world.
Serbia announces highest state of readiness The President of Serbia and Russia will meet tomorrow to discuss the situation in Kosovo
Serbian President Vucic has ordered the country's armed forces to enter a state of maximum operational readiness in view of the occupation by Kosovo special forces of the access to the water storage lake of the Ghazivoda Hydropower Station in northern Kosovo, which is controlled by the Belgrade side, Nantong said, citing the Office of the President of Serbia.
On 29 September, the Serbian Minister of Defence, Vulin, declared that the Serbian army had entered a state of full operational readiness.
Wulin stressed that as long as the order issued by Vucic remains in force, Serbia will continue to monitor the current situation in Kosovo and that the SLA will respond regardless of the direction of the situation.
On September 29, Vucic said in an interview that he had briefed parties such as the United States, Russia and Europe on the current situation and would travel to Moscow on October 2 to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to seek Putin's support on Kosovo, according to Russian news agency Tass.
Asked if Serbia needed Russian military support like Syria, Vucic gave a negative response: "I don't want a major military conflict on our territory."
Vucic also said the SLA had entered a full state of readiness only to form a deterrent to stop the conflict, but it was also a clear warning that no violence in Kosovo would be tolerated.
The reason why the SLA has increased its operational readiness is related to two major moves by the Kosovo side.
According to the Serbian side, in recent days, Albanians have been arresting Serbs who have lived there for generations in northern Kosovo, and the arrested Serbs have not broken any law.
According to Vucic, since the beating and detention of Marko Yulic, head of the Kosovo and Metohija Office of the Government of Serbia, by the Kosovo Afghan Army on 26 March this year, ethnic Albanians have been escalating the situation in the region, carrying out inhuman arrests and evictions of Serbs.
In addition, more than 100 people, including the ROSU special forces of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Kosovo, armed police and snipers, who had recently announced their establishment, occupied positions near the water storage lake of the Ghazivoda Hydropower Station, entered the ecological and sports centre near the dam in the northern part of the Kosovo region and blocked all nearby roads, which were originally under the control of the Serbian side.
Vucic noted that the military adventure in Kosovo was carried out at the instigation of Western countries and that the move by the Kosovo army did not inform the Serbian side in advance, in violation of chapter IX, paragraph 1, of the Brussels Agreement, as well as United Nations Security Council resolution 1244 and the military technical agreement between Serbia and Kosovo.
Vucic has shouted to NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, criticizing Western countries' hypocritical rhetoric on Kosovo.
The root cause of the current conflict is still a centuries-old historical feud between the two communities in Kosovo.
With regard to the attribution of Kosovo, the Serbs and Albanians have their own accounts.
Serbia sees Kosovo as the birthplace of the nation and the cradle of culture, where Serbia established its strongest state in the 12th century, and ethnic Albanians moved in large numbers only after the invasion of the Ottoman Empire and the defeat of the SLA to the north.
Albanians, for their part, insist that the Ilirians, the original tribe that lived in Kosovo in the 4th-5th century BC, were the ancestors of ethnic Albanians and that Kosovo has therefore been ethnic Albanian territory since ancient times.
Subjective political divisions have led to violent clashes between different ethnic groups, religions and cultures, resulting in a fierce confrontation between Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo.
In 1912, Kosovo Albanians first declared Albania's independence.
After the First World War, a large number of Albanians living in the Balkans moved to Turkey, and the proportion of Serbs increased relatively. In the view of the Serbs, the practice of "just taking back their own land" was seen by the Albanians as a plunder of "Greater Serbia", and the conflict between the two communities intensified.
Kosovo has become a "powder keg" in the Balkans.
In 1999, armed clashes between Albanian separatists in the Kosovo Liberation Army and the Serbian army and police led to the bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia made up of Serbia and Montenegro by NATO forces and the outbreak of the war in Kosovo.
On 17 February 2008, Kosovo unilaterally declared independence from Serbia.
Since then, it has been reported that Serbia will normalize relations with Kosovo and sign a global and legally binding agreement, but the agreement, which is subject to multiple forces, including the United States, Europe and Russia, has not been signed because of historical national vendetta and geopolitical constraints.
Just a month ago, Vucic made it clear for the first time that he advocated the separation of Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo and once again the openness of the conflict between the two communities.
Power communications still disrupted in Indonesia's strong earthquake with tsunami rescue difficulties
According to figures released by Indonesia's Disaster Relief Agency in the early hours of the morning, 420 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami in Donggara County, Central Sulawesi Province, on the 28th.
Willem Rampangilei, head of Indonesia's disaster relief agency, said the figure was only preliminary statistics from the city of Palu, Central Sulawesi province, about 80 kilometers from the epicenter, and that many of the city's densely populated buildings, such as hotels, shopping malls and warehouses, which were damaged by the earthquake, had not yet been searched because of a lack of large search and rescue machinery.
A bridge damaged by an earthquake and tsunami collapses into sections on Ba Road, Indonesia, on September 29, 2018 local time.
As a result of the serious damage to power and communications facilities, the epicenter of the earthquake, Dongara County, and the adjacent Xigi area, are still unconnected "isolated islands" and the number of victims cannot be counted.
Indonesian Vice President Kara said the death toll could reach thousands, the media reported.
Power outages, communications outages, road blockages, airport damage... rescue efforts after the strong earthquake and tsunami are difficult.
As a result of the power outage, some hospitals and rescue settlements in the city of Palu have to rely on fuel to generate electricity.
Roads in and out of the city were blocked by landslides and large transport vehicles, including fuel tankers, were unable to enter, making fuel supplies tight.
Indonesia's social minister, Agus, said emergency relief supplies such as tents, mattresses, blankets, clothing, food and household goods packages transferred by the ministry from the provinces of South Sulawesi and Columbus, near the quake zone, had not yet arrived in the disaster area because of road damage.
Disaster relief materials transferred from the capital, Jakarta, are being transported to the disaster area via air force transport planes.
In view of the damage to the command tower and runway at Paru Airport in the earthquake, in order to ensure safety and security of rescue, all commercial flights have been suspended for the departure and landing of military aircraft carrying relief supplies and personnel only.
Indonesia's chief minister for political, legal and security affairs, Villanto, who directed the rescue in the quake zone, called for the restoration of power supplies and commercial flight services at the airport as soon as possible to ensure the operation of rescue agencies such as hospitals and allow more rescue workers, volunteers and aid to reach the disaster area.
A number of powerful earthquakes occurred in Donggara County, Central Sulawesi Province, Indonesia, on the 28th, including a powerful 7.7-magnitude earthquake at 1702 hours local time that triggered a tsunami, causing major disasters in the cities of Palu, Dongara County and Xigi.
BEIJING, Oct 1 (Xinhua) -- Beijing has continued to open the most beautiful blue sky model, attracting thousands of people in the capital to show their happiness on social platforms and continue to brush their screens, saying that "under the blue sky and white clouds, 'drunk 'the beautiful skyline, this is the best business card in Beijing".
Since August, Beijing has ushered in the "bluest sky".
Within the capital, people can be seen at any time and anywhere, either holding smartphones or holding a single-reverse camera to take photos.
Weibo, microblogging friends circle and other social platforms, can be seen everywhere in the netizen's lens of the Palace Museum, Tiananmen Square, Bird's Nest, Hutong... all kinds of buildings show different beauty against the blue sky.
Some netizens said that such a "big picture of scenery" is the best urban propaganda film in Beijing; others quipped that if such a blue sky is brushed for a long time, people with cervical spondylopathy can be cured; and some netizens hoped that "this blue can cross the winter and welcome the spring and summer, so that the sky in the capital is blue in the four seasons".
Why do the people of the capital particularly love to bask in the blue sky?
Only because people living in the city in the past have suffered from haze and haze, they are particularly eager for the blue sky, and after the "blue sky defense war" in Beijing, which has continued to improve air quality, the haze has become less and the blue sky has increased.
On National Day, the weather in Beijing is fine.
At 8 a.m., the vast majority of the city's 35 air quality monitoring stations showed "first-class excellent" green.
The "Bluest Sky" theme photography competition, which is spontaneous by the public on the social platform, is continuing.
Why is the sky so blue in Beijing recently?
In August, the average concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in Beijing was 35 ug / cubic meter, the best record for the same period in nearly five years, according to the head of the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau.
The real-time concentration of PM2.5 in September was more frequent in single digits.
One of the main factors in the emergence of the "bluest sky" is that meteorological conditions have been generally favourable in recent years. More importantly, Beijing's consistent efforts to combat air pollution, its efforts to promote a clean air action plan over the past five years, and the continued release of environmental benefits have led to a reduction in the total amount of pollutant emissions in the region, all of which have laid the foundation for the sustained improvement of air quality.
Beijing officially released and implemented the Beijing Clean Air Action Plan 2013-2017 in 2013.
Under the plan, officials continue to guide the dredging of non-capital functions, promote clean energy replacement and pollution reduction, and phase out 4,923 coal-fired boilers.
As a result, Beijing has also become the first big city in mainland China to achieve full-net natural gas.
According to the data, between 2013 and 2017, the average annual concentration of PM2.5 in Beijing fell by 35.6%; the number of days of air quality standards increased by 50 days; the number of days of first-class excellence increased by 25 days; the number of days of heavy pollution decreased by 35 days, and the incidence of heavy pollution decreased significantly.
While air quality has continued to improve, Beijing officials, on the basis of a new round of PM2.5 source analysis, issued the "Three-Year Action Plan for Beijing to Win the Blue Sky Guard War" in September this year. In view of the current stage of control and pollution characteristics, they have focused on key areas of prevention and control such as diesel trucks, dust and volatile organic matter control, optimized and adjusted the transport structure, industrial structure, energy structure and land use structure, strengthened regional joint prevention and control, focused on strengthening the refined management of the city, promoting green development in an all-round way, and striving to make the "bluest sky" resident in the capital no longer the background of the people's photo album.
During the Golden Week of the National Day this year, the Municipal Tourism Commission, industry and commerce, city management, public security and other relevant departments will strengthen law enforcement inspection of the "one-day tour" market, focusing on the "six black" chaos of tourism. Once verified, those who violate the law will be given a heavier and strict superimposed punishment in accordance with the law.
Yesterday morning, the municipal government held a special meeting to crack down on illegal "one-day tours", and deployed a special operation to further crack down on illegal "one-day tours".
At the meeting, it was revealed that, focusing on the "six black" chaos of the intertwined chain of interests of black tickets, black guides, black societies, black cars, black shops and black networks, the city has launched a special campaign to crack down on illegal "one-day tours" since July 28.
Since the launch of the special operation, the city has received 39 complaints about "one-day travel", a decrease of 63% year-on-year. Since this year, the city has received 270 complaints about "one-day travel", a decrease of 62% year-on-year.
In the past two months, 248 "black cars" have been seized in the city, 158 violations of tourism passenger transport business have been investigated and dealt with, 29 shopping "black shops" and performing arts venues have been closed, 13 "black societies" and 27 "black guides" have been investigated and dealt with, 26,000 illegal advertisements have been confiscated, 31 illegal "one-day travel" billboards have been removed, 3 fake bus station signs have been removed, 1,789 illegal acts of various kinds have been investigated and dealt with, 181 cases have been filed by various functional departments, 4.48 million yuan have been fined and 111 people have been detained.
After rectification, the illegal "one-day tour" disorder has been basically curbed, and the market order of the "one-day tour" has shown a steady and positive trend.
According to the report, in recent years, the city has continuously stepped up its efforts to combat illegal "one-day tours".
In 2016 and 2017, the Municipal Tourism Commission received 1,612 and 897 complaints about "one-day tours", a decrease of 79% and 44% respectively, but illegal "one-day tours" were still repeated, often rebounding, and formed a "six-black" chaos in which the chain of interests such as black tickets, black guides, black societies, black cars, black shops and black networks were intertwined.
In particular, illegal Range Rover personnel on the streets are "black tickets", illegal websites that publish false tourism information are "black networks", travel agencies engaged in illegal "one-day tours" or institutions or individuals that do not have the qualifications of travel agencies are "black societies", tour guides employed by "black societies" without a tour guide's license or illegal practice are "black guides", vehicles with no tourist passenger qualifications or vehicles with tourist passenger qualifications that provide passenger services for illegal "one-day tours" are "black cars", and they eventually bring tourists into designated tourist shops.
In this special operation, the city has continued to increase the fixed and mobile inspection of illegal "one-day tours". In response to the high incidence of illegal "one-day tours" and the high impact of tourist routes, the relevant departments have sent secret visit teams to get on the bus every day to visit the group, and after finding evidence of violations of the law, they have strictly investigated and dealt with them in accordance with the law.
Among them, "black car" and "black shop" have become the focus of the two special operations.
According to the introduction, without black cars, illegal "one-day tours" will not be able to take place. Black cars are not only easy to find, remember and investigate, but also a fixed asset with high individual value.
The relevant departments have used road traffic monitoring probes to increase the supervision of tourist buses on key "one-day tour" routes, and can detect and deal with "black cars" in a timely manner by means of scientific and technological intelligence such as technical prevention and material prevention.
Tourist shopping "black shop" because of the small number, sitting on the ground to operate, has also become the focus of the crackdown.
In order to strengthen the deterrent and crackdown on illegal "one-day tours", all functional departments shall, in accordance with the law, impose heavier and strict superimposed penalties on those who have been found to be illegal and illegal in the special operations.
In August this year, the city also held a seminar on legal issues related to cracking down on illegal "one-day tours", which discussed the means and measures to combine administrative penalties with criminal convictions.
The Municipal Tourism Commission said it would encourage more regular travel agencies to carry out "one-day tours" in Beijing in the future and increase the supply of regular "one-day tours" in order to further squeeze the living space of illegal "one-day tours", and specific plans are still under study.
In addition, the Municipal Tourism Commission has continuously improved the electronic itinerary information system for tour groups to ensure that each team is included in the supervision of the electronic itinerary platform.
From a tourist symbol to a digital economy symbol, what Wuzhen has experienced over the years
As the permanent site of the World Internet Congress, how Wuzhen can undertake the dividends of the summit has attracted much attention.
Since the first World Internet Congress, in the past five years, the changes in Wuzhen have been visible to all.
In 2014, there were only 12 businesses related to the digital economy and the Internet in the town, and by the third quarter of this year, there were more than 500.
This is a microcosm of Wuzhen's development of the digital economy.
With the convening of the Internet Congress, local enterprises can accept the enlightenment of the digital economy and the digital wave at zero distance. The desire for the transformation and upgrading of enterprises is very strong. Traditional manufacturing enterprises have increased their investment and research and development in the areas of machine replacement and intelligent management.
Jiang Wei, party secretary of Wuzhen Town, said Wuzhen will build a new economic empowerment center in the future.
The development of digital economy cannot be separated from the support of infrastructure.
This year, Wuzhen launched a 5G pilot work on the basis of achieving full coverage of the 4G communication network and free WiFi.
At the same time, Tongxiang City, where Wuzhen is located, as the first county-level city in the country to build a special channel for international Internet data, has also become a hot land for the development of the Internet industry.
Since the first World Internet Congress, Tongxiang has introduced 565 digital economy projects, with a total planned investment of 37.725 billion yuan. In the first three quarters of this year, the total output value of the core manufacturing industry of the digital economy was 8.73 billion yuan, an increase of 13% year-on-year.
"Wuzhen used to be a tourist symbol, and then there were more theatrical and cultural symbols. Because of the Internet Congress, it is now a symbol of the Internet and the digital economy."
Sheng Chun-jun, secretary of the Tongxiang Municipal Committee, believes that the dividends of the World Internet Congress have accumulated over time. Therefore, it is also more necessary to set up a platform to undertake the superimposed introduction of talents, projects, technology and other factors.
Shen Yi, a native of Tongxiang, has been working outside the country for 20 years, because of his relationship with the Internet Congress, returning home to start a business.
On December 2 last year, he walked into the 4th Internet Light Expo with a high-capacity tamper-proof digital technology solution, which was popular with multiple customers.
Shen Yi chose to start a business in Wuzhen not only because of the hometown complex. "In Wuzhen, it is easier to recruit people than I thought, and our application has landed quickly, and there is our application in the Wuzhen Wisdom Parking Project."
A Wuzhen Avenue, presents the spillover effect of the Internet Congress.
This road, which runs through the north and south of Tongxiang, is not only a series of tourist attractions, but also an industrial road.
Relying on it, Wuzhen Avenue Ke Chuang agglomeration area came into being.
The reporter learned that in the future, Wuzhen Avenue will become the main position for the development of Tongxiang industry, taking the lead in applying a large number of achievements such as intelligent medical care, intelligent old-age care and intelligent government affairs, and gathering industries and many high-level talents, which account for 80% of the city's GDP.
At least 410 people have been killed in tsunami triggered by powerful earthquake in Indonesia
The earthquake in Central Sulawesi province has killed 410 people, 97 of whom have been identified, according to the head of the public information bureau of Indonesia's Jakarta police on the evening of 29.
Another 29 people are missing and 540 injured.
Palu airport remains closed.
With active treatment, the survival rate of premature babies of 29 weeks or more in China has reached 98%, which has reached the level of developed countries.
SHANGHAI, Sept 30 (Chen Jing Luo Yanqian) The National Children's Medical Center and the Pediatric Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University revealed on the 30th that it had introduced advanced Canadian methods in the leading "China NICU Inpatient Premature Infants' Prognosis Quality Improvement Project".
The results of the project show that, after active treatment, the survival rate of premature babies of 29 weeks and above in China has reached 98%, which has reached the level of developed countries, but there is still much room for improvement in the survival rate of premature babies of very small fetal age and premature babies without complications.
For nearly 20 years, the Chinese government has been paying attention to the treatment of newborns.
At present, the infant mortality rate in Shanghai has fallen to 3.71 per 1,000, which is significantly lower than the national average and has reached the advanced level of developed countries.
The "China NICU Inpatient Premature Infants Prognosis Quality Improvement Project" has greatly improved the quality of life of premature babies through four years of unremitting efforts.
Professor Cao Yun, director of the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of the Pediatrics Hospital attached to Fudan University, told reporters that while improving the survival rate of premature babies, paying attention to reducing the quality of survival of premature babies, reducing the incidence of complications, improving the prognosis of neurodevelopment and improving the overall outcome of children is of great significance to improving the overall quality of life and the quality of the population of premature babies. It is an important issue of concern to the paediatrics and Cenozoic paediatrics circles at home and abroad, as well as a key issue of concern to the project.
Through four years of unremitting efforts, the NICU Project for the Improvement of the Quality of Prognosis of Inpatient Premature Infants in China has included tens of thousands of premature babies aged 33 weeks or less across the country, resulting in a one-third reduction in the mortality rate of premature babies of small birth age and small birth weight in China, while the incidence of serious complications in premature babies has decreased significantly, greatly improving the quality of life of premature babies.
Through the establishment of a national network for the improvement of the quality of newborns, the introduction of the concept of cooperative quality improvement, the radiation of 25 cooperative hospitals throughout China, and the establishment of a complete, systematic and effective method for the improvement of the quality of cooperation in improving the prognosis of premature babies and improving the level of treatment of newborns, which is suitable for the national conditions.
The Pediatrics Hospital attached to Fudan University, in conjunction with the National Cenozoic Pediatrics Force, is accumulating experience on the basis of the project to formulate guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections, so as to provide reference and guidance for the standardized diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections in China.
It is understood that in the "Project to Improve the Quality of Prognosis of Premature Infants in China," paediatric hospitals have introduced the EPIQ method into 25 large NICUs in 19 provinces across the country, working to solve the problem of infection of premature babies that has plagued China's neonatal care rooms.
After more than 10 years of continuous improvement, Canada's complication-free survival rate for premature babies has increased by about one-third, and Canada is now one of the best countries in the world for the prognosis of premature babies.
The EPIQ method has now been applied to all NICUs across Canada and has been adopted by six countries.
The paediatric hospital revealed that the results showed that two years after EPIQ intervention, infections in premature babies fell by 35%, while antibiotic use fell by 20%.
In the future, the Pediatric Hospital attached to Fudan University will continue to popularize and implement this method throughout the country, with a view to reducing the incidence of all complications in premature babies in an all-round way and improving the quality of treatment for newborns throughout the country.
At present, it is an indisputable fact that there are differences and heterogeneity in the level of treatment in China.
According to Professor Cao Yun, as an important construction unit of the National Children's Medical Center, the paediatric hospital will play a leading role in radiation. The study covers a number of western provinces, including Xinjiang, Guizhou, Gansu and Shaanxi, with a view to gradually promoting the homogeneity and standardization of neonatal treatment throughout the country.
It is understood that the Pediatric Hospital attached to Fudan University, in conjunction with the National Cenozoic Pediatrics Force, is accumulating experience on the basis of the project to formulate guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections, so as to provide reference and guidance for the standardized diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections in China.
It was revealed that in 2019, the China Neonatal Co-operation Network, located at the Pediatrics Hospital attached to Fudan University, will work with 63 hospitals across the country to carry out the next phase of national quality improvement, with a view to promoting the uniform development of the level of neonatal treatment in China.
Wu Shenglei, director of the Shanghai Municipal Health and Family Planning Commission, said that Shanghai's ability to become a central city in the heart of Asia is not only reflected in research, but also in the construction of the whole service system, the quality of service and the results of service should have a place in Asia, thus truly reflecting China's medical level.
Xin Zhiping: Build the "Hero Monument" in the heart -- written on the 5th anniversary of the martyrs.
On September 30, on the eve of the Republic's 69th birthday, we celebrated the 5th anniversary of the martyrs, and Xi Jinping and other party and state leaders came to Tiananmen Square to attend a ceremony to present flower baskets to the people's heroes.
At this moment, wherever you are, please pay tribute to the Great Britain.
Remembrance Day, is to relive, is to wake up.
Open the heavy history, behind the name of each martyr, is a fresh life.
They, also have hot youth, have sincere love, have concerned family.
However, because they firmly believe that "the doctrine that we believe in is the truth of the universe", they are willing to sacrifice everything in order to "spare the suffering of the next generation".
"I have to shout for China for a day when I survive".
Through time and space, the martyrs set up a spiritual road sign, guiding the way forward.
"Where to come from, where to go" "What kind of person to be", read English, it is not difficult to get the answer.
In memory of the martyrs, the most important thing is to build a "hero monument" in the heart.
According to incomplete statistics, since the revolutionary war years, about 20 million martyrs have died valiantly for national independence, the liberation of the people and the prosperity and strength of the country.
For a variety of reasons, many of the martyrs did not even leave their names.
Countless martyrs irrigate their ideals with blood, practice their faith with their lives, remember their names and pass on their spirit, which is to protect the roots and soul of the nation.
This "monument to the hero" is not allowed to be defaced or damaged.
For some time, historical nihilism, pan-entertainment and other undercurrents are surging.
All kinds of practices that distort history and derogate the martyrs, challenge the conscience of justice, deranged value judgment, and cause the public anger and vigilance of the whole society.
Great men must not be desecrated, and heroes must not be forgotten.
We must not let go of the act of touching the bottom line. We must dare to light the sword and defend the dignity of the Great Britain with the rule of law and justice.
On May 1 this year, the Law on the Protection of Heroes and Martyrs came into force.
From the point of view of judicial practice, the judgment of some cases is very popular, not only effectively safeguarding the glorious image of the British martyrs in accordance with the law, but also releasing the positive energy of advocating heroes and respecting the martyrs.
A nation with pursuits cannot be without heroes, and a country with ideals cannot be without pioneers.
Remembering the martyrs and calling for heroes has become a universal social consensus.
At present, there are millions of memorial facilities of all kinds throughout the country, and more than 100 million people visit the martyrs' cemetery each year.
The human heart is the strongest foundation.
Let it become a trend to advocate heroes, defend heroes, learn heroes and care for heroes, and let the spirit of the British be integrated into the blood of the nation. A number of "hero monuments" will stand tall between heaven and earth and deep in the hearts of the people.
BRUSSELS, Sept 28 (Reuters) -The European Union took a non-stand-off stance against Italy on Friday after Italy defied European Union demands and surprised markets with a large budget deficit plan, but the European Union may take a more aggressive stance if it sticks to too bold goals.
Italy's Eurosceptic government is targeting a budget deficit of 2.4% of gross domestic product over the next three years, suggesting that there has been no debt reduction in the face of deficit reduction requirements alone.
"We have no interest in the crisis between the executive committee and Italy," Moskovesi, the European Union's executive committee on economic affairs, said on Friday, responding cautiously as EU proposals and sanctions could have little impact on Italy.
EU officials and diplomats still hope that market forces will persuade Italy to adjust its budget plan before it is formally presented to the EU's executive committee in mid-October.
The euro fell to its lowest level in nearly two weeks on Friday after the government announced its plans, while Italian bond yields hit their highest level in three weeks.
If the deficit target remains unchanged by the October deadline, the EU's executive committee could veto Italy's draft budget, something the executive committee has never done to any country.
Speaking at a meeting in the Latvian capital Riga later on Friday, the vice-president of the European Union's executive committee, East Blovsky, said Italy's current fiscal plan "does not seem to be in line with the Stability and Growth Pact," referring to the EU's fiscal rules.
But he did not say how the EU would react.
Tenderers may submit their applications for participation in the public tender before 26 October this year.
Previously, the Russian Ministry of Agriculture made China one of the priority markets for Russian agricultural exports.
The Russian Agricultural Supervision Bureau announced in May that Russia's grain exports to China exceeded 1 million tons for the first time this agricultural year, a record.
The bureau predicts that China could be among the top 10 Russian grain importers.
China News Agency, Sapporo, September 30 (Xinhua) -- After a 3-0 victory over Cuba in the first match, the Chinese women's volleyball team beat Turkey 3-0 on the 30th to win two straight in the group stage of the 2018 World Championships.
But compared with the first battle, the Chinese women's volleyball team is more difficult.
There are 24 teams participating in the 2018 World Women's Volleyball Championships, with the Chinese women's volleyball team in Group B with Italy, Turkey, Bulgaria, Canada and Cuba.
In terms of the world rankings and overall strength of the teams in Group B, Turkey and Italy are China's main rivals.
After the start of the match on the same day, the Chinese team entered the state faster, took the lead at the start, maintained their advantage throughout the process, put a lot of pressure on their opponents on their serve and block, and won the first set 25-18 more smoothly.
The Turkish team, which entered the second set, served very hard and took a 6-2 lead at the start. The Chinese team adjusted its formation after asking for a timeout, gradually tied the score to 7, and then blocked the net several times to score 7-0. At the end of the set, the Turkish team chased the score to 15:19 at one point; after the Chinese team got the set point at 24:20, the tenacious Turkish team chased two points in a row; and after the Chinese team again asked for a timeout, they won the second set 25-23 with Zhu Ting's running attack.
In the third set, the situation was very glued, the score between the two sides rose alternately, at one point tied at 19.
At the crucial moment, the Turkish team made a mistake. After taking a 21: 19 lead, the Chinese team won the match point at 24:21 with Zhu Ting's strong smash and Zhang Changning's attack. The Turkish team then chased the score to 23:24. After the Chinese team asked for a timeout, Zhang Changning scored in attack and the Chinese team locked in a 25-23 victory.
Chinese women's volleyball coach Lang Ping admitted after the match that the whole game was not easy.
"We are well prepared, the blocking is good, the Turkish team is more comprehensive, we have to reduce our mistakes and try to win by scoring on our own initiative." he said.
In the face of her familiar team-mates in the past, Zhu Ting, who played for Turkey's Wakiver Bank team, was limited in the first set of the day's match, and then she took the initiative to change and still played a strong attack.
"They are familiar with each other and it is normal to be targeted by their opponents, but the Chinese team played to the extreme, blocking and attacking well in the face of a bad pass." he said.
The Chinese women's volleyball team will next have a day of truce for physical and technical training, and will face Canada, the third opponent in the group stage, on October 2.

Nearly a thousand state-owned scenic spots cut ticket prices by more than half by more than 20%
As of September 28, 981 scenic spots had been opened or reduced free of charge (74 were opened free of charge and 907 were reduced), and scenic spots such as Shilin, Dali Santa, Yulong Xueshan, Guilin, Guangxi, Wuyi Mountain, Fujian Province, Zhangjiajie, Hunan Province, Terracotta Warriors and Horses in Shaanxi Province, Sanqing Mountain, Jiangxi Province, and Kanas, Xinjiang, had all been reduced.
In order to implement the decision-making and deployment of the Central Economic Work Conference and the Report on the Work of the Government, the National Development and Reform Commission issued the Guiding Opinions on Improving the Mechanism for the Formation of Ticket Prices in State-owned Scenic Areas to Reduce Ticket Prices in Key State-owned Scenic Areas (hereinafter referred to as the Guiding Opinions) on June 28, which call for the improvement of the mechanism for the formation of ticket prices in state-owned scenic spots in terms of rationally defining the composition of ticket pricing costs, innovating price management methods and strictly implementing pricing procedures, so as to ensure that the reduction of ticket prices in key state-owned scenic spots by the end of September has achieved remarkable results.
In accordance with the deployment requirements, all localities have actively carried out their work, and have successively reduced the price of tickets for a number of key state-owned scenic spots.
As of September 28, 981 scenic spots had been opened free of charge or reduced prices (74 were opened free of charge and 907 were reduced), of which 159 were 5A-level scenic spots and 534 were 4A-level scenic spots, totalling 693, or 70.6%.
Of the 907 scenic spots with reduced prices, 491, or 54.3%, fell by more than 20%, and 214, or 23.6%, fell by more than 30%.
Yunnan, Shandong, Guangxi, Shaanxi and other provinces have a large number of price-cutting scenic spots, of which the number of price-cutting scenic spots in Yunnan is more than 100, an overall decrease of more than 30%.
Anhui, Chongqing and other 8 provinces (districts, cities) government pricing 5A-level scenic spots all realized price reduction.
Scenic areas such as Shilin, Dali Santa, Yulong Snow Mountain, Lijiang River in Guilin, Guangxi, Wuyi Mountain in Fujian Province, Zhangjiajie in Hunan Province, Terracotta Warriors and Horses in Shaanxi Province, Sanqing Mountain in Jiangxi Province and Kanas in Xinjiang, which have high social attention, have all implemented price cuts.
The gradual return of ticket prices to a reasonable range in key state-owned scenic spots is conducive to accelerating the transformation and upgrading of tourism from the ticket economy to the industrial economy, small-scale tourism to mass tourism and scenic spot tourism to the whole region, forming a virtuous circle of optimization of the supply structure of tourism and steady expansion of the demand for tourism consumption, and promoting the sustained and healthy development of scenic spots and tourism.
At the same time, the National Development and Reform Commission stressed that all localities should strengthen the regulation of price order in scenic spots, guide scenic spots to upgrade their services and ensure that price cuts do not reduce quality.
In addition, the National Development and Reform Commission has conducted a special inspection of the recent problems reflected by the media, such as the small decline in ticket prices in individual scenic spots and the fact that they have not fallen, requiring all localities to deal with them seriously, respond to social concerns in a timely manner and effectively implement the price reduction in place.
Trade Promotion Bureau to carry out short-and long-term optimization work in an orderly manner
The Macao Trade and Investment Promotion Bureau has submitted a report on the short-and medium-term optimization of "major investment migrants" and "skilled migrants". At present, in addition to stepping up the promotion and implementation of the work in the report, it has been continuously listening to the views of the community and continuously optimizing the content of the report and related work.
The TPA will introduce the relevant optimization work to all sectors of the community as soon as possible.
Of these, five are short-term measures to be implemented this year; five are medium-term measures to be implemented in 2019; and one is long-term measures.
In addition, the Trade Promotion Bureau has conducted a comprehensive review of its internal management system in accordance with the instructions of the Financial Secretary for the Economy, Mr Leung Witt.
The five short-term measures launched this year include:
1. To carry out a review exercise. Priority will be given to reviewing cases that are about to expire for seven years, the cases mentioned in the ICAC report and new renewal cases. If cases of misconduct or signs of wrongdoing are found, they will be referred to the relevant judicial authorities for follow-up on their own initiative;
2. Field inspections of projects involving "major investment migrants". More than 20 investment projects had been inspected by late September;
3. To conduct a comprehensive review of the current evaluation system. Six principles for the analysis of investment projects have been re-established in the evaluation of applications for "major investment migrants". In the evaluation of applications for "skilled migrants", the examination and approval mechanism will be improved by clarifying the elements conducive to the development of Australia and the conditions for the priority absorption of talents. At the same time, a list of "five industries and 10 jobs" with annual priority for the introduction of talents has been drawn up to absorb talents in a more targeted manner in line with the policy direction of the HKSAR Government;
4. To increase the transparency of information, including plans to gradually publish the approval criteria, scoring criteria and proportion from the 4th quarter of this year, and to further refine and make public the approval data;
5. With regard to the improvement of the confirmation mechanism, it has been required to check the work in Australia before confirmation, while major investments must be checked on the spot and financial statements submitted.
The five medium-term measures to be implemented in 2019 include:
1. To establish a mechanism to regularly hear the views of the Commission on Talent Development and the Commission on Economic Development. A working meeting was held with the Commission on Economic Development in September to discuss the establishment of the mechanism.
2. Require the applicant to submit annual financial statements prepared by an independent third party in order to keep under review the operation of the investment project;
3. Further standardize and electronic the process of case application and approval in order to reduce human error;
4. A comprehensive review of the current staffing situation in line with the implementation of a number of optimization measures;
5. Intensify research on the revision of the "Temporary Residence System for Investors, Managers and Specially Qualified Technical Personnel".
As for long-term measures, we will step up the study on the revision of the law. It is expected that the drafting of the relevant regulations will be carried out in the first half of 2019, with a view to completing it as soon as possible, further clarifying the criteria for the examination and approval of temporary residence permits, the review mechanism and the confirmation mechanism, and increasing the investigation function of the Trade Promotion Bureau to more accurately approve and supervise applications for temporary residence permits.
Experts from the national film-free cotton on-site observation and discussion and exchange activities walked into the test field to hear a briefing from the representative of the team of Academician Yu Shuxun of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.
China New Network Xinjiang Shaya September 30 (Geng Dandan Wang Xiaojun) located in Shaya County, Xinjiang, the film-free cotton planting test base, the film-free cotton is growing happily, compared with the mulch cotton next to it "no less", a cluster of snow-white cotton is competing to "open", covered with branches.
From September 27 to 28, the national film-free cotton on-site observation and seminar and exchange activities were held in Shaya County, Xinjiang.
At the observation meeting, the reporter learned that the film-free cotton technology system, with "medium cotton 619" and its supporting cultivation measures as the main body, has initially achieved the goal of film-free cultivation in cotton fields, reduced the pollution of the ecological environment and raw cotton by the residual film in cotton fields in Xinjiang, and made significant progress in the research and demonstration of the comprehensive technology of film-free cotton.
Academician Yu Shuxun, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, a well-known cotton genetic breeder and chief scientist of the cotton system of the National Modern Agricultural Industry Technology System, introduced the growth of film-free cotton to Zhou Guomu, party secretary of Zhejiang Agricultural and Forestry University School.
"The comprehensive technology of film-free cotton we have developed can fully realize the cultivation of cotton without mulch, completely solve the problem of residual film pollution and realize green cotton planting." he said.
Introduction by Yu Shuxun, Academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.
Xinjiang is the most important cotton-producing area in China. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the area under cotton cultivation in Xinjiang in 2017 was 35 million mu, accounting for 61% of the country's cotton area.
Since the introduction of mulch into China in 1982, the area of mulch of all kinds of crops in Xinjiang has reached more than 50 million mu, and the annual use of mulch is about 300,000 tons.
Among them, the cotton mulch coverage rate reached 100%, and the cotton field mulch accounted for about 60% of the use of mulch in Xinjiang.
To measure the yield of film-free cotton, the yield of cotton can be 320 kg to 350 kg per mu.
With the increasing input of mulch in Xinjiang, the low recovery rate of residual mulch, the gradual increase in the amount of residual film in the soil, and the destruction of soil structure caused by residual film have seriously affected the sustainable development of agriculture.
The residual film not only causes serious pollution to the soil, but also has a great impact on the quality of cotton fiber.
At present, more than one-third of the cotton fields in Xinjiang have achieved mechanized harvest.
In 2017, the area of machine-picked cotton in Xinjiang was about 14 million mu.
In the process of machine-mining cotton harvest, a large amount of surface income, the broken film on the cotton plant and the broken film adulterated in the original cotton are difficult to remove in the process of raw cotton processing, and cannot be completely removed in the process of follow-up textile processing, seriously affecting the quality of textile products.
On September 28, the national film-free cotton on-site observation and discussion and exchange activities were held in Shaya County, Xinjiang.
In order to focus on solving mulch pollution in cotton fields, simplifying cotton planting technology and improving the efficiency of cotton fields, Yu Shuxun led his team to implement the "medium cotton 619" film-free cotton technology cultivation over an eight-year period to "add wings" to the green development of agriculture in Xinjiang.
Yu Shu-xun introduced that through innovative new ideas of breeding, a new line of land-based cotton, "medium cotton 619", which is particularly precocious, saline-alkali-resistant, low-temperature-resistant and high-yield, has been bred.
"Under the conditions of film-free cultivation in the southern part of Xinjiang, 'China Cotton 619' has achieved a series of supporting measures, such as film-free sowing machinery, improvement of sowing depth, shallow burial of drip belt under film-free conditions, suitable sowing density screening and reasonable chemical control."
At present, film-free cotton demonstration bases have been set up in Aksu, Kulle, Alar and other places, with a yield of 4,800 kg per hectare.
Planting cotton without film has achieved high yield, cost-saving, environmental protection and comprehensive efficiency.
Zhang Donghai, an agronomist at the Institute of Agricultural Sciences of the Third Division of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, said that through the research and demonstration of film-free cotton cultivation technology in the past six years, the yield of film-free cotton seed cotton can fully achieve a yield of 320 kg to 350 kg per mu, possibly even higher.
"The popularization of film-free cotton cultivation technology is very promising."
Zhang Donghai believes that at present, film-free cotton cultivation technology can completely solve the problem of soil residual film pollution, but there is still a certain gap in economic benefits compared with mulch cultivation.
"The support of the purchase price of cotton will be conducive to future promotion."
Yu Shu-xun said that the next step, he and his team will continue to carry out in-depth research and large-scale popularization and application of film-free cotton, make the film-free cotton industry bigger and stronger, and completely solve the problem of soil pollution caused by mulch.

According to the Guangdong Maritime Bureau, before the festival, key ships such as water sightseeing tourist ships, Qiongzhou Strait passenger ferries, Pearl River Estuary high-speed passenger ships and ferry ferries were carried out to ensure the stability of the water traffic safety situation during the long holiday.
During the Golden Week, traffic in Guangdong Province is expected to be firmly at the top of China.
Guangdong Provincial Transportation Group recently issued holiday highway travel guidelines, which expect highway traffic to increase by about 12%.
The General Administration of Market Supervision recently issued the Notice on Strengthening Market Price Supervision during the National Day of the Mid-Autumn Festival in 2018, which calls for strengthening price supervision in the field of housing rental and real estate, cracking down on price violations such as collusion in rent prices, hoarding rental housing sources, fabricating false information to inflate rents, charging fees by means of bundled services, publishing misleading price information and not clearly marking prices.
The notice is clear that we should strengthen price monitoring and early warning and pay close attention to market price dynamics.
All localities should pay close attention to the necessities of life such as high consumption of grain, oil, meat, poultry, eggs, vegetables and milk salt, as well as the market and price changes of special commodities consumed by local residents during the holidays, and strengthen price monitoring and analysis and early warning.
Once the tendentious and seedling problems of market fluctuations are found, timely measures are taken to defuse them effectively.
We should strengthen the supervision and inspection of the wholesale and retail links of necessities of life, increase the frequency and supervision of places closely related to the daily consumption of the masses, such as the commercial super-market and the farmers' market, and urge operators to operate in accordance with the law and in good faith.
The notice pointed out that inspection in key areas should be strengthened to create a good holiday consumption environment; the supervision of ticket prices in state-owned scenic spots should be strengthened; emphasis should be placed on investigating and dealing with illegal and illegal acts such as non-implementation of the price level or floating range set by the government in state-owned scenic spots, unauthorized addition of fee items, disguised increase in ticket prices through the illegal establishment of "garden" tickets, high pricing and large discounts, bundled sales, failure to price clearly in accordance with the regulations, non-implementation of preferential measures, extra-price increases and compulsory collection of fees.
The notice calls for strengthening the supervision of the price of necessities of life, especially agricultural products.
Affected by seasonal changes, natural disasters and outbreaks, the prices of essential agricultural products such as vegetables and pork have recently fluctuated in some areas.
All localities should, in the light of the actual local situation, effectively strengthen the supervision of market prices for agricultural and by-product products, cooperate with the relevant departments in stabilizing production and market supply, and organize efforts to carry out key market inspections and random spot checks.
We will increase the frequency of inspection of pork and other commodities with tight supply and rapid price increases, and seriously investigate and deal with illegal acts such as hoarding, price-raising and collusion in price increases.
The notice states that price supervision in the housing rental and real estate sectors should be strengthened.
The Mid-Autumn Festival and the National Day coincide with the peak season for the sale of housing rental and commercial housing. All localities should pay close attention to the price behavior of real estate enterprises, intermediary companies and housing rental-related enterprises, crack down on price violations such as collusion in rent prices, hoarding of rental housing sources, fabricating and hype false information to inflate rents, charging fees by means of bundled services, publishing misleading price information and not clearly marking prices, increase the inspection of the price situation of hot-selling properties and real estate agents on sale, and investigate and deal with the failure to implement "one set of one standard" in accordance with the regulations to disrupt the order of the real estate market, purify the real estate market, and create an open and transparent price order of the real estate market.
The notice mentioned that all localities should do a good job in price supervision of other links in the tourism industry, focus on standardizing the price order of catering, accommodation, shopping, sightseeing, entertainment and parking, guide operators to do a good job in the public announcement of prices and fees, and seriously investigate and deal with all kinds of price violations.
The notice said it was necessary to strengthen the inspection of transport prices such as roads, railways, civil aviation and water transport, and to seriously investigate and deal with illegal acts such as illegal price increases, out-of-price tolls and non-clear pricing in accordance with the regulations.
We will implement the "green channel" for the transport of fresh agricultural products and the policy of waiving tolls for small passenger cars on major holidays.
We should innovate regulatory means and working methods, strengthen the publicity of price laws and regulations for online and offline commodity retail enterprises and e-commerce platforms, urge operators to improve price promotion plans, and investigate and deal with illegal acts such as fictitious original prices, misleading price tags and non-compliance with price commitments in accordance with the law.

Former foreign aid accused of playing fake ball North Control responds to "unwarranted "-China New Network
Yesterday afternoon, the Beijing Holdings Football Club (hereinafter referred to as North Control) issued an official response to the news that the team's former foreign aid, Anichebe, had accused the team of playing fake balls. The North Control issued a statement saying that there was absolutely no case of playing fake balls on the club's side, which was a lie fabricated by Anichebe himself during the arbitration process in order to cover up his flagrant violation of the contract and for his personal improper economic purposes.
At the same time, North Control said it would reserve the right to take all means to investigate the responsibility of the relevant parties.
Nigerian player Anichebe has accused FIFA of playing fake balls by the Beijing North Control team he played for last year, including the Beijing derby in the 21st round of the 2017 season, the Daily Mail reported.
At that time, it was a critical stage for the Beijingers and Chong Chao, who lost 0-2 away from home to the Beijingers and Anichebi started.
In response to the Nigerian player's claims, there was an official response from the North Control Club yesterday.
The statement said that after a previous internal investigation by the club, there was no fake ball playing in the games the team had participated in.
Anichebe joined Beijing North Control in June 2017, and in December of the same year, Anichebe refused to return to the team for winter training without proper reason and still refused to return to the team despite repeated reminders from the club.
At present, the dispute between the two sides has been referred to FIFA and arbitration is under way.
The statement also mentioned that the high-profile "fake ball allegation" was in fact a lie fabricated by Anichebe during the arbitration process in order to cover up his flagrant violation of the contract and for his personal improper economic purposes.
Its only purpose of defaming the club and defaming Chinese football is to obtain improper economic benefits.
The club does not accept any organization or any individual, for the sake of its economic interests and personal vendetta, to make unwarranted accusations, defamation, slander and denigration of the club.
Therefore, the North Control side said it would reserve the right to use all means to investigate the responsibility of the relevant parties.

The relevant person-in-charge of the agricultural issue said that, in accordance with the progress of the acquisition and the demand for funds used by enterprises, if there is a shortage of purchase funds, the agricultural issue will apply for additional funds on the basis of 20 billion yuan of credit funds to ensure the timely and full supply of funds, maintain the stability of the grain market and protect the interests of farmers.
Chinese journalist taken away by police at British Conservative Party annual meeting, China demands apology
According to the website of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom, a spokesman for the British Embassy answered questions on Monday about a Chinese journalist who was taken away by police during the annual meeting of the British Conservative Party.
'We ask the Conservative Human Rights Commission to stop interfering in China's internal affairs, stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs, and ask the organizers of the conference to apologize to Chinese journalists,' the spokesman said.
A reporter asked: During the annual meeting of the British Conservative Party on September 30, the party's Human Rights Committee held a side meeting on Hong Kong and invited the Hong Kong opposition to speak at the meeting.
A Chinese journalist was taken away by the police during the meeting.
Do you have any comment?
In response, the spokesman said that in the 21 years since Hong Kong's return to the motherland, the practice of "one country, two systems" had been a great success and Hong Kong's development achievements had been universally recognized.
Hong Kong is the Hong Kong of China, and Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs.
The Conservative Human Rights Commission used the party's annual meeting to hold a side meeting to open the eyes of anti-China separatist forces, and China expressed serious concern and strong dissatisfaction.
We are firmly opposed to any interference by any organization in Hong Kong's affairs in any way.
Any attempt or act of advocating "Hong Kong independence" is futile.
The spokesman said the UK had always touted freedom of expression, but it was completely unacceptable that Chinese journalists had been obstructed and even physically assaulted when they asked questions at side meetings to express their views.
We ask the Conservative Human Rights Commission to stop interfering in China's internal affairs, stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs, and ask the organizers of the conference to apologize to Chinese journalists.

In the final analysis, the innovative development driven by Internet technology is to create a better future for the people of all countries in the world and to create a more equal, open and inclusive environment for the well-being of mankind, economic development and the well-being of society.
In a large Internet country such as China, which has a large user base, Internet technology has a strong amplification effect in specific applications.
For example, Beidou, China, provides users with high-precision and high-reliability positioning, speed measurement and timing services, as well as unique short-message communication capabilities; the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has a reshaping function for traditional industries, promotes industry progress, and plays a positive role in many fields, including finance, transportation, health and safety; and heaven and earth communication technology has helped to effectively solve the problem of Internet access by means of transport such as aircraft and high-speed rail and improve users' Internet experience.
According to the 42nd Statistical Report on the Development of the Internet in China, released by the China Internet Information Center, China, as the world's largest Internet market, is promoting social development and progress through the digitization process.
The dividend of the development of Internet technology is not limited to China, but its achievements also bring a strong driving force to the development of the Internet and even the economic and social development of the whole world.
For example, China's cross-border electricity business and sharing economy are moving overseas, which is increasingly supporting world economic growth. The development of a new generation of information technologies, such as cloud computing, big data, the Internet of Things and the mobile Internet, has accelerated the deepening of the global industrial division of labour and economic restructuring, and reshaped the global economic competition pattern.
As outlined in the "Wuzhen Initiative" issued by the Second World Internet Congress, sharing the fruits of network development, promoting the early formation of a global network market and creating more jobs will provide strong support for the sustained and healthy development of the global economy and allow more countries and people to take the express train of the information age.

Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in a speech to the U.S. Council on Foreign Relations on Friday that China-U.S. relations are once again at a crossroads, and that if the two sides can take a positive and inclusive view of each other, expand and deepen positive cooperation and properly manage differences and contradictions, they can open up better prospects.
"China-US relations are our common asset and need to be taken care of together."
He expressed the hope that people of insight from all walks of life in the two countries would take practical actions to maintain the healthy and stable development of China-U.S. relations and jointly push China-U.S. relations in the right direction.
Wang Yi also stressed once again that China will certainly come out of a different path of development from the traditional powers.
This path with Chinese characteristics determines that China will not and will not repeat the mistakes of national strength and hegemony, and that China will neither become the United States, challenge the United States, nor replace the United States.
In a speech entitled "Opportunity or challenge, partner or opponent," Wang Yi said the deep-seated crux of the problem is that some American friends believe that China will also be a strong country and will even challenge and replace U.S. leadership in the world.
"This is clearly a major strategic miscalculation."
But this self-imagined suspicion is spreading, amplifying existing contradictions, giving rise to new doubts, and making it more difficult and more resistance between China and the United States to solve specific problems, he said.
Wang Yi pointed out that China is on a path of peaceful development.
The Chinese have never had a gene for external expansion.
We believe that all countries can live together in harmony, exchange and learn from each other.
In the past, now or in the future, China will neither copy foreign models nor ask other countries to replicate China's practices.
Earlier, Wang Yi said during a meeting with former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in New York that China-U.S. cooperation would be win-win and that confrontation would inevitably be lost.
China has always been committed to developing long-term, healthy and stable China-US relations to achieve non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation.
China's new office held a press conference on Tuesday to introduce and interpret the White Paper on "Facts on China-US Economic and Trade Friction and China's Position".
Fu Ziying, China's vice minister of commerce, said at the conference that China is willing to work hard to promote the development of bilateral trade in a more balanced direction and hopes the U.S. side will also show a positive stance.
The Indonesian island of Sulawesi was hit by a powerful earthquake and tsunami on September 28, causing serious damage to several cities along the coast, with the latest news showing that the death toll has risen to 1,200, foreign media reported.
The town of Donggala in the city of Palu, near the epicenter, was reportedly hit by two rounds of tsunamis, and authorities believe the death toll will continue to rise as the "golden 72 hours" of rescue pass.
Rescuers carry an earthquake survivor rescued from under the rubble of a restaurant in Palu, Central Sulawesi Province, Indonesia, September 30, 2018 local time.
Officials from the disaster relief department said the tsunami brought large waves of up to 6 meters, and the impact of the earthquake and tsunami exceeded previous estimates.
Hundreds of people are understood to have been celebrating the festival on the beach in Palu at the time of the earthquake and tsunami, with many killed when they were swept away by large waves.
Officials said the tsunami hit the shore at 800 kilometers per hour and many buildings and infrastructure were destroyed.
He said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed, and mudslides triggered by the tsunami cut off a major highway in Palu.
A bridge across a coastal river collapsed in Sulawesi.
On September 30 local time, Indonesian President Zoko visited the city of Central Sulawesi Palu, where the earthquake occurred.
Indonesian President Zoko, who visited the disaster area on September 30, said he had sent troops to assist in the search and rescue and called on the victims to be patient.
Zoko pointed out that the rescue operation was difficult because of a shortage of heavy machinery and manpower.
He learned that there was a lack of water, food and fuel in many parts of the disaster area, and that many merchants had been closed after the earthquake and had sent aircraft to airdrop supplies.
He called on the victims to be patient and stay in their original position waiting for rescue.
Search and rescue workers in the city of Palu said they heard a cry for help from a collapsed hotel in the city, but some people needed to save people with their bare hands because there was no heavy machinery to remove the rubble.
Indonesian Vice President Kara said the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami could eventually rise to thousands after power and communications were cut off in some areas, causing information to be blocked.
Shenyang, Nov 5 (reporter Xu Zhiqiang correspondent Yan Yina) reporters learned today from the Liaoning Provincial Court's meeting on the basic resolution of the difficulty of execution that the Liaoning Provincial Court, during the half-year campaign to implement the "storm", severely cracked down on refusal to execute, transferring 241 people for refusal to commit crimes, and maintaining a high-pressure situation in combating refusal to commit illegal crimes.
It is understood that, in accordance with the unified deployment of the Liaoning High Court, from the beginning of April to the end of September, the Liaoning Court launched a half-year campaign to basically solve the "storm" of implementation difficulties, massing its dominant forces and launching a comprehensive general offensive against the basic solution of implementation difficulties.
At the same time, the courts of the province have organized and carried out "five batches" activities in accordance with the law, with a number of fines, a number of detentions, a number of restrictions on consumption, a number of penalties for breach of trust, and a number of transfers for refusal to commit crimes.
At the beginning of the event, there were more than 132,000 outstanding cases in the courts of the province. At the end of July, the cases were cleared to the bottom.
During the activities, the courts of the province fined the person subjected to execution a total of 12.0607 million yuan, detained 4,146 people, restricted consumption of 162,844 people, punished 55,128 people for breach of trust, and transferred 241 people for refusal to commit the crime.
From January to October this year, the Liaoning courts accepted 297,438 cases of execution, an increase of 13.28% year-on-year; concluded 226,558 cases, an increase of 83.18% year-on-year; and implemented 31.236 billion yuan, an increase of 74.94% year-on-year.
"Where can I take a taxi?
We want to go to Golden Bauhinia Square to see the National Day flag-raising ceremony! "
Mr. and Mrs. Song, who flew from Ningxia to Shenzhen and transferred to Shenzhen on the first bus of the National Day of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong High-speed Railway, were interviewed by China News Agency at Hong Kong's West Kowloon Station on the morning of October 1.
On the morning of 1 October, to celebrate the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region held a grand flag-raising ceremony at Golden Bauhinia Square.
According to statistics from the Entry-Exit Control Point, as of September 30, the number of passengers entering Hong Kong via the West Kowloon Station of the high-speed rail line had exceeded 300,000.
On the occasion of the 69th anniversary of the motherland, the West Kowloon Border Inspection Station expects a peak of visitors to Hong Kong on October 1 and 2.
At about 7 a.m. on the first day, the reporter saw in the arrival hall that many Mainland passengers took advantage of the National Day Golden Week to take high-speed rail to visit Hong Kong.
The brisk-footed Mrs. Song told reporters that the National Day holiday is a rare long holiday of the year. It has always been her wish to come to Hong Kong's Golden Bauhinia Square to see the flag-raising. She feels particularly happy and excited to be able to achieve this wish on the National Day.
However, at present, flights from Ningxia to and from Hong Kong are not convenient. Fortunately, the Hong Kong section of the high-speed rail line was opened to traffic. After inquiring about the train timetable, Mr. Song found that the first bus could arrive at 7.33 am to connect the city's means of transport to Golden Bauhinia Square. The time was just good.
He lamented with the reporter: "High-speed rail is really too convenient, fast and on time!"
The 70 one-hour short-haul trains daily to and from Guangzhou South, Shenzhen North and Fukuda and West Kowloon have greatly facilitated the arrival of residents in the Tai Wan area of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao.
After arriving in Hong Kong, Mr. Liu, who lives in Shenzhen, is preparing to go to the top of Central to meet his Hong Kong friends.
"Both the Mainland and Hong Kong are on holiday on National Day. We intend to challenge ourselves to see if we can complete the 50-kilometer Hong Kong Island Trail," Mr. Liu said.
He explained that if it had not been for the opening of the high-speed rail line, the convenience of travel and the abundance of time, they would not have dared to try such a long-distance mountain trip.
Mrs. Yang, from Dongguan, took her 10-year-old son to Hong Kong on a high-speed rail to take part in a piano competition. She proudly told reporters that her son had been studying the piano for three years and felt very meaningful to spend the National Day in this way.
She had been taking a bus to Hong Kong before, but it took time and effort. She was worried about affecting her son's condition. This time, she came via Shenzhen on a high-speed rail line to facilitate customs clearance and halve the time. She was even more impressed by the trip to the Hong Kong section. "It seems to take the subway, it's very fast, and I didn't have time to take a photo," she told reporters.
At 6.44 pm on September 23, the G5711 "Harmony" high-speed rail train set off from Shenzhen North Station and sped all the way. A few minutes later, the train entered the Hong Kong section of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong high-speed rail line, the first officially operated high-speed rail train to be welcomed in the Hong Kong section.
The Hong Kong section of the high-speed rail line, which is integrated into the country's 25,000-kilometer high-speed rail network and runs directly to 38 long-distance stations across the country, has also welcomed Mainland passengers from different provinces in the south and north of the country.
Mr. Gao, who came to Hong Kong from Changsha to visit his family on a long holiday, told reporters that the high-speed rail line had to sit in the north of Shenzhen, take the subway through Hong Kong and then transfer to the city's means of transport. It was troublesome and time-consuming to change. Now it was very happy to sit directly in the heart of Kowloon and eat the lunch made by the children at home.
He said the "one-place, two-inspection" customs clearance process was more convenient than thought. "In less than 10 minutes, both customs have passed."
The West Kowloon Station, which is adjacent to the Airport Express and connects land and air traffic, has also become the preferred place for many transit passengers.
Miss Wu, from Fujian, was preparing to travel from Hong Kong to the Philippines for the Golden Week with her girlfriends. She pushed her luggage out of the gate in West Kowloon and told reporters without illness: "I was afraid I would not be able to catch the plane, I didn't expect it to be so fast, there was more than enough time!"
The new U.S .-Mexico-Canada trade deal will retain U.S. President Trump's ability to implement the threat of a 25% tariff on imported cars, while essentially exempting passenger cars, pickup trucks and auto parts imported from Canada and Mexico from paying tariffs, according to a trade agreement subsidiary arrangement released on Monday.
If Trump imposes so-called "Chapter 232" tariffs on cars for national security reasons, both Mexico and Canada would have a tax-exempt passenger car quota of 2.6 million vehicles exported to the United States each year.
Under the ancillary arrangement, pickup trucks produced in both countries will receive full tariff exemptions.
If Trump imposes tariffs on cars, Mexico will receive a tax exemption quota of US $108 billion a year for auto parts and Canada will receive a quota of US $32.4 billion.
Both quotas are well above the current level of production in both countries, providing room for growth in their exports.
WASHINGTON / MEXICO CITY, Sept 28 (Reuters) -After days of debate, U.S. President Trump's administration and Canada are making practical efforts to resolve trade policy differences, raising hopes that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is expected to maintain the form of a three-way agreement, Mexico said on Friday.
Despite the lack of details, the apparent progress was enough to prompt the governments of Mexico and the United States to abruptly halt plans to publish the text of the two-party trade agreement and give Canada more time to join the agreement.
Mexico's president-designate, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, told reporters in Mexico that the U.S. government had made new counter-proposals to the Canadian government and said he would continue to push for all three countries to participate in NAFTA.
Mexico's economy minister, Ildefonso Guajardo, said the submission of the text of the U.S .-Mexico trade agreement to Mexican and U.S. legislation had been delayed because the Canadian and U.S. governments were "very seriously" trying to reach an agreement.
"In the next 48 hours, we will know whether we will reach a text of the three-way agreement or have to publish the text of the two-party agreement." Guajardo said.
Guajardo said his U.S. and Canadian counterparts "specifically requested" a delay in the release of the text.
A spokesman for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) did not comment on the text of the U.S .-Mexico trade agreement or the U.S .-Canada consultations.
Officials from the Canadian prime minister's office and the foreign minister's office did not respond to requests for comment on the counter-proposal.
Two lions play together at a conservation center on the outskirts of Pretoria, the South African capital, and it is difficult to see any anomalies, but they are unique, foreign media reported.
"This is the first young lion ever to be born by artificial insemination-the first pair in the world." the University of Pretoria announced.
School scientists are working on the reproductive system of female African lions.
Ganswinter, director of the Institute of Mammal Research at the University of Pretoria, said the two cubs, born on August 25, one female and one male, were quite healthy and normal.
After 18 months of intensive trials, his team finally made the breakthrough.
"We collected sperm from a healthy male lion." Ganswinter told the media.
Next, the researchers artificially inseminated the lioness when the hormone levels in her body reached the right level.
"Fortunately, the result was successful." Mr Ganswinter said.
He said the researchers "made several attempts, but unexpectedly, it didn't take much effort".
He said the breakthrough could be repeated, and scientists hope to use the technology to save large endangered cats.
According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, lions have become extinct in 26 African countries, and the total number of surviving wild lions has fallen by 43% over the past 20 years, leaving only about 20,000.
African lions are listed as vulnerable by the group.
"If we don't do something for this animal, they will face extinction." Ganswint said.
He said the new technology did not need to allow lions to be raised, but simply injected sperm into a fertile lioness, as has been done in North America and Europe for captive elephants.
South Korea's exports fell the most in more than two years in September, but analysts blamed the decline on fewer working days and said global demand for South Korean goods remained strong despite rising trade tensions between China and the United States.
Indeed, South Korea's average daily exports increased last month.
In addition, initial value data released earlier showed double-digit growth in exports in the first few weeks of September before the long holiday.
South Korea's exports fell year-on-year in September, the biggest year-on-year decline since July 2016, more than the 5.7% decline forecast by 11 analysts surveyed by Reuters.
Initial values released on Monday showed exports stood at US $50.6 billion in September, down from US $51.2 billion in August.
South Korea's exports to China rose 7.8% in September, expanding for the 23rd month in a row, despite concerns that a growing U.S .-China trade dispute could hurt other export-dependent Chinese neighbors.
South Korea's exports to the United States fell 11.8% as sales of oil products fell.
Overseas sales of South Korean memory chips and petroleum products rose 28.3% and 13.5%, respectively, despite concerns that the so-called "super-cycle" of chips may have peaked.
"However, the impact of the trade conflict will be difficult to avoid, as South Korea's exports are heavily dependent on the U.S. and Chinese markets." he said.
Imports fell 2.1% to US $40.8 billion, also less than the 3.1% increase forecast in the Reuters survey.
The initial value of the trade surplus in September was US $9.7 billion, up from US $6.9 billion in August.
The Ministry of Industry says global manufacturing will remain buoyant thanks to the United States and European Union countries, which is a plus for South Korean exports.
"Higher export prices caused by higher oil prices will also benefit exports in the second half of the year." the statement said.
"But the continuation of the trade conflict between the United States and China, coupled with increased market volatility after the U.S. interest rate hike, is a negative pressure on exports." he said.
On average, exports per working day rose to US $2.6 billion in September, compared with US $2.1 billion in August.
South Korea's Mid-Autumn Festival falls on September 24-26, so there are only 19.5 working days in September, four days less than in the same period last year.
South Korea's exports rose 4.7% in January-September from the same period last year.
South Korea's manufacturing activity recovered in September, according to the Nikkei / Markit purchasing managers' index, but was supported by domestic orders as orders from China and Japan fell, threatening to cloud the outlook for other exports.
North Korean media criticise US for not easing sanctions against North Korea
North Korea's Labor News published a signed opinion piece on September 30 criticizing the United States for not easing sanctions against North Korea while seeking dialogue with North Korea, calling it a "paradoxical" approach.
The article said that U.S. Secretary of State Pengpeo said on the 14th that "in order to achieve the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, the key is to implement sanctions against the DPRK," stressing that the position of the United States to continue to implement United Nations sanctions resolutions remains unchanged.
In a joint statement between the DPRK and the US in Singapore, the two sides pledged to establish a new DPRK-US relationship that is compatible with the aspirations of the Korean and American peoples for peace and prosperity.
It is undoubtedly paradoxical that the United States, while increasing the pressure on sanctions, calls for dialogue.
The article said that if a new DPRK-US relationship is to be established, a permanently consolidated peace system is to be built on the Korean peninsula and the complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is to be achieved, the construction of trust should be given priority and resolved in stages one by one, starting with what can be done.
The article also said the United States should understand that sanctions will not work against North Korea.
Even the North Devansk, which preceded the Kazan, was admired by the U.S. military, the article said.
"We will meet a strong potential opponent," the National Interest magazine quoted the U.S. Navy as saying. "Just look at the North Devansk submarine is enough."
Fogo, the current commander-in-chief of the U.S. Navy in Europe, also praised the North Devansk submarine.
"The submarine is impressive, and looking at the development of the Russian navy and how resources are used shows that its main efforts in research and development are first and foremost to strengthen the submarine fleet." he said.
But the National Interest magazine still believes the United States maintains an advantage over Russia in this area.
"I believe that the West still has an asymmetric advantage." Fogo said.
It follows news that the Russian navy will load the Kazan submarine in 2019.
The multi-purpose submarines "Kazan", "New Siberia", "Krasnoyarsk" and "Alhangrsk" are all modified "wax-M", with a displacement of 13,800 tons, a depth of 520 metres, a strength of 64 personnel and an underwater speed of 31 knots. They will carry mines, torpedoes and "calibre" and "onyx" cruise missiles.
The General Administration of Radio and Television of the Beijing News (reporter Ni Wei) issued the Notice on the Implementation of the Special Regulation of Radio and Television Advertisement on September 29, which will carry out the special regulation of radio and television advertising from this date until the end of this year.

According to the notice, this special remediation work focuses on nine aspects of the search and rectification.
Specifically, they include: advertisements with orientation problems; advertisements with vulgar content, low style and low grade; advertisements with excessive time-out and failure to broadcast problems in accordance with the regulations; advertisements for medical care, drugs, medical devices, health food, cosmetics and beauty with problems such as exaggerating and exaggerating false publicity, misleading the audience, or publishing them in disguised form of programmes, and medical and health-care programmes with problems that have been broadcast without record management; advertisements that exaggerate and exaggerate false publicity, mislead the audience and lure the audience into being deceived; advertisements that have problems such as attracting business, investing in financial management and collectibles with expectations of investment returns; advertisements that induce minors to produce bad behavior or form bad values and harm the physical and mental health of minors;
The remediation work will achieve full coverage throughout the country, and the requirements for remediation and regulation will be fully implemented to the radio and television media at all levels, the frequency of channels, the columns and periods of programmes, and "there will be no blind areas, no dead corners and no exceptions".
The notice requires the administrative departments of radio and television at all levels to deal with all kinds of illegal and illegal advertisements found in the course of supervision and inspection in strict accordance with the Measures for the Handling of Violations by Radio and Television Broadcast Agencies of the General Administration.
If the circumstances of the violation are serious, they shall be dealt with seriously, such as admonition, notification of criticism, suspension of the broadcast of advertisements until the suspension of the broadcast of frequency channels, and shall be publicly exposed to the public as appropriate.
In recent years, the General Administration of Radio and Television has repeatedly called a halt to illegal advertisements.
This year, the State Administration of Radio and Television issued a notice publicly calling for the suspension of advertisements for serious violations such as "0-bubble fruit milk", "Sharva Cocktail" and "Bonrette Plant Anti-Breeding Hair Dew", which have orientation deviations and exaggerated publicity and misled the audience.
The General Administration of Radio, Radio and Television has formulated a number of regulations and notices to regulate the broadcast of advertisements on radio and television.
The Notice on Further Strengthening the Administration of Advertisements for the Broadcasting of Television Shopping Short Film by TV Channel stipulates that television channels shall not broadcast advertisements for television shopping short films between 18:00 and 24:00 a day.
When advertisements for short television shopping films are broadcast at other times, the moderator shall not be used for publicity, the "hawking" exaggerated voice, intonation and movement shall not be used for publicity, the "orthopaedic", "plastic", "fat-penetrating" and "fat-throwing" shall not be used for publicity or disguised publicity of breast enhancement and weight loss products, and no more than one (second) advertisement for short television shopping clips shall be broadcast every hour every day, each of which shall not exceed three minutes.
The Circular on Further Strengthening the Administration of the Broadcasting of Radio and Television Advertisements stipulates that when placing advertisements in the middle of film and television dramas, television stations must strictly abide by the provisions of Order No. 61 of the General Administration: two commercial advertisements may be placed in each episode (in 45 minutes) during non-prime time, each time not exceeding 1 minute and 30 seconds; one commercial advertisement may be placed in each episode during prime time (19:00 to 21:00) for a period of not more than one minute; and the length of the advertisement shall be prompted when placing advertisements.

We should standardize the form of health information advertising, and should not publish advertisements in disguised form in the form of health information special programs.
Special programmes on health information shall focus on the introduction of scientific knowledge such as disease prevention, control and treatment, shall not contain advertising content such as medical care, drugs, medical devices and health food, and shall not be certified in the name of patients and doctors, pharmacists and experts.
"For the first time, we have adjusted the format of the MAKS International Aerospace Salon. We have suggested that China be the main guest country. Our Chinese counterparts have agreed and accepted our invitation." Manturov said.
Not long ago, Chinese President Xi Jinping attended the 4th Eastern Economic Forum at the invitation of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
It was his first appearance at the forum.
Ignore the American threat!
EU may reach crude oil procurement deal with Iran
The U.S. government has claimed it will restart a new round of sanctions against Iran in November and has even urged other countries to reduce imports of Iranian oil.
Still, America's allies don't seem to be listening.
In an interview on the 29th, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif revealed that Tehran is close to reaching an agreement with the European Union on the sale of crude oil, despite U.S. threats to sanction any country that does business with Iran, the New York Times reported.
The central purpose of the agreement is to try to create a new payment mechanism to replace dollar transactions by barter or local currency denomination.
The approach is intended to bypass the United States and prevent the United States from obstructing financial transfers.
At the same time, while the European Union is working to broker the agreement, some French and British officials are also concerned that if the agreement comes to fruition, it will be the most open confrontation between the European Union and the United States, which oppose the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.
In an hour-long interview, Zarif's words sounded more optimistic than in recent months, U.S. media said.
Because the agreement has the ability to "divest" traditional U.S. allies and effectively break with U.S. attempts to cut Iran's revenues.
"This will ensure that we sell oil and benefit," Zarif said, arguing that countries have a legitimate right to trade with Iran under the 2015 agreement.
The European Union's foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, also said recently that "no sovereign country or organization can accept others to decide who they can trade with."
However, she also predicted that U.S. leaders could take a series of financial measures aimed at targeting banks, businessmen and countries with business dealings with Tehran before the U.S. government launches its next sanctions in November.
In May, the U.S. government unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear agreement on the grounds that the agreement was flawed, saying it would not permanently ban Iran from producing nuclear fuel.
The United States then threatened to ban companies that buy Iranian oil and other commodities from doing business in the United States.
The threat caused some companies to withdraw from Tehran and the Iranian currency plummeted.
Companies such as Airbus and French oil giant Total have cancelled billions of dollars in investments in Iraq.
British and French officials have said the U.S. government may "have the upper hand".
Not surprisingly, according to a recent Turkish media report, the U.S. sanctions do not appear to have had much impact on Iran's oil exports.
Iranian Oil Minister Zangane has revealed that no country other than South Korea has stopped buying Iranian oil.
Both Zarif and Iranian President Rouhani believe that a series of U.S. actions are aimed at "enticing" Iran to violate the agreement.
Zarif was also dismissive of a series of verbal attacks by the United States, and when asked if the United States would overthrow the current Iranian government with increasing financial pressure, Zarif even laughed, "It is a regime change strategy, which is the real purpose of the United States."
"Re-Tour of Battery Remembering Fanghua ": Xiamen Huli Mountain Battery Cultural Tourism Market Opens
Chen Fei-fei, the first announcer to broadcast Minnan Mandarin at Fujian Front Radio Station, came to the Battery to recall the history of the Battery.
The famous tourist scenic spot, the Huli Mountain Battery Scenic Area in Xiamen, which is separated from Jinmen, was once the home of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to set up a "front-line radio station".
On the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the establishment of the "Front-line Radio Station", on the 30th, the scenic spot held a "Re-visit to the Battery Remembering Fanghua" event, inviting several historical witnesses from the front-line radio station to talk about the historical changes of the Battery and witness the development and changes of cross-Straits relations.
The historical witness of the front-line radio station told the history of the Battery.
This is one of the second "Xiamen Huli Mountain Battery Cultural Tourism Market" series of activities created by the Huli Mountain Scenic Area.
Previously, the first event was successfully held here to create an exclusive cultural tourism brand event that integrates cultural tourism IP, creative markets and traditional folk culture experience.
On the same day, under the guidance of the Xiamen Tourism Development Committee and hosted by the Huli Mountain Battery Scenic Area in Xiamen, the second cultural tourism market of the "Ancient Battery New Era" officially opened. During the 6-day event, it will focus on the "happy reunion" of the Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day, so that the people who come to visit will experience the rich Minnan customs in "eating", "swimming", "buying" and "entertainment".
The "Hear the Sound of the Sea" concert has become a big point of view of the Battery Cultural Tourism Market.
Wang Yong, director of the Huli Mountain Battery Management Office, said that the "Re-Tour of the Battery Remembering Fanghua" event, held to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the opening of the front-line radio station of the Huli Mountain Battery of the People's Liberation Army, invited several old broadcasters of the Battery to tell about the history of the Battery and let people remember the extraordinary years of the past.
In addition, the tourism market series also includes choral concerts on the 40th anniversary of the reform and opening-up, the selection of old photos, and the 2018 public welfare exhibition of large-scale single art installations on both sides of the Taiwan Straits.
Among them, the "Hearing the Voice of the Sea" concert, as a major point of view of the Battery Cultural Tourism Market, is an exclusive cultural brand event created by the scenic area. It invited the Phoenix Flower Women's Choir of the Children's Palace of Xiamen to sing a chorus concert on the 40th anniversary of reform and opening-up at the ancient Battery, which is accompanied by the sea by the mountains, to show the collision between the "Ancient Battery" and the "New Era".
The public welfare exhibition of large-scale single art installations on both sides of the Taiwan Straits was carried out in the Battery Scenic Area during the National Day, focusing on creating an "eyeball effect", attracting a large number of tourists and citizens to visit, take photos, forward friends' circles and film shaking sounds, so that the city of Xiamen can add another "net red" factor.
And "Xiamen 40 Years of You and Me" -- the old photo selection campaign, set up an exhibition of award-winning works in the scenic area, through a temperature photo, deep excavation of those happy and moving moments.

The regulation provides for the implementation of a lifelong inquiry system for liability for ecological and environmental damage.
Whoever, in violation of the requirements of scientific development, causes serious damage to ecological and environmental resources shall be held accountable for life to the main leading cadres and relevant persons in charge who bear the leadership responsibility.

In order to further encourage overseas investors to invest in China, four ministries, including the Ministry of Finance of China, jointly announced that, with effect from January 1, 2018, the scope of application of the policy of not collecting advance income tax for domestic direct investment for the profits allocated by overseas investors from resident enterprises in China will be expanded from foreign investment incentive projects to all projects and areas that are not prohibited from foreign investment.
According to a notice published on the website of the Ministry of Finance, the suspension of advance income tax by overseas investors must meet several conditions at the same time, including direct investment by overseas investors with profits, including equity investment such as capital increase, new construction and equity acquisition by overseas investors with profits, but excluding the addition, transfer and acquisition of shares of listed companies (except eligible strategic investment).
It also includes that the profits earned by overseas investors belong to the equity investment income such as dividends and dividends formed by the actual distribution of the retained income already realized by Chinese resident enterprises to investors.
If the profits used by overseas investors for direct investment are paid in the form of cash, the relevant funds shall be transferred directly from the account of the profit distribution enterprise to the account of the invested enterprise or the assignor of equity, and shall not be turned around in other accounts inside and outside the country before the direct investment; if the profits used by overseas investors for direct investment are paid in non-cash forms such as physical objects and securities, the ownership of the relevant assets shall be transferred directly from the profit distribution enterprise to the invested enterprise or the assignor of equity, and shall not be held or temporarily held by other enterprises or individuals before the direct investment.
The notice states that overseas investors actually recover their direct investment that enjoys the treatment of the policy of not collecting income tax in advance through the transfer of equity, repurchase and liquidation, and, within 7 days after the actual collection of the corresponding funds, declare to the tax authorities the payment of the deferred tax in accordance with the prescribed procedures.
In order to encourage overseas investors to continue to invest and operate in China, four ministries, including the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Commerce of China, jointly issued a notice at the end of 2017 that, with effect from January 1, 2017, the profits allocated by overseas investors from resident enterprises in China will be invested directly in incentive investment projects, and if the prescribed conditions are met, a deferred tax policy will be implemented and no advance income tax will be levied for the time being.
The executive meeting of the State Council of China decided last week to expand the scope of application of the temporary non-collection of advance income tax on foreign reinvestment from incentive foreign-funded projects to all non-prohibited projects and fields, and further strengthen the protection of intellectual property rights.
The reporter learned from the National Health and Health Commission that, compared with decades ago, the incidence of malnutrition among children and adolescents in China has declined, while the incidence of overweight and obesity has increased significantly.
In this regard, experts pointed out that the most important concept of maintaining a healthy weight is to "cure the disease", vigorously promote scientific fitness and a reasonable diet.
According to the "Core Information and Interpretation of Health Education for Young People in China (2018 Edition)" recently released by the National Health and Health Commission, the key to maintaining a healthy weight is a reasonable diet and scientific exercise.
Overweight, obesity and blind weight loss are all bad for your health.
The health hidden dangers behind the "little chubby pier" cannot be ignored.
Ding Gang-qiang, director of the Institute of Nutrition and Health of the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said overweight obesity is harmful to the normal growth and development of young people, has a negative impact on their psychology, behavior, cognition and intelligence, and can even lead to high blood pressure, high blood sugar and high blood lipid in children.
At the same time, overweight and obesity in teenagers are prone to continue into adulthood, which will increase the risk of chronic diseases such as high blood pressure and diabetes in adulthood.
Ding Gang-qiang said tests on the nutrition and health of Chinese residents in 2010-2012 showed that the rate of overweight among children and adolescents aged 6-17 in China was 9.6% and the rate of obesity was 6.4%, adding up to 16%.
At the same time, overweight and obesity among children and adolescents is characterized by higher boys than girls and higher in cities than in rural areas, and the rate of overweight and obesity has increased significantly in recent decades.
How do teenagers cope with overweight and obesity?
Zhang Li, deputy director of the Center for Scientific Fitness and Health Promotion of the State General Administration of Sports, pointed out that the main causes of obesity among young people are excessive calorie intake and insufficient physical activity.
For this simple obesity, attention should be paid to scientific exercise and reasonable diet control.
Zhang pointed out that the most important concept of maintaining a healthy weight is to "cure the disease". One of the most important elements is to provide all-round science education to schools, parents and students, popularize the dangers of overweight and obesity, and raise young people's awareness of prevention.
Adolescents should undergo regular medical examinations, monitor growth and development indicators such as height and weight, detect early and scientifically judge whether there are overweight and obesity problems, so as to take timely intervention measures.
For young people who are already overweight and obese, Ding Gang-qiang suggested that, in addition to actively and scientifically arranging meals and exercise, young people are at a special physiological stage. They should avoid the use of hunger or semi-hunger therapy to control and lose weight, and should not take weight-loss drugs blindly.
Sept 28 (Reuters) -Facebook (FB.O) said on Friday that hackers stole digital landing code, giving them access to nearly 50 million user accounts, unprecedented in scope and the worst security breach in its history.
Facebook, which has more than 2.2 billion monthly users, said it had not yet determined whether the attacker misused any accounts or stole personal information.
The company also did not find the location of the hackers and was not sure whether the hackers targeted specific victims.
Its preliminary analysis showed that it was a large-scale attack.
In a media conference call, Chief Executive Zuckerberg called the incident "really serious".
A spokesman for the company said his account, as well as that of operations chief Sheryl Sandberg, were also affected.
Facebook shares fell 2.6% on Friday, dragging down major Wall Street stock indexes.
U.S. lawmakers said Friday that the attack could increase calls for data privacy legislation.
"This is yet another sad evidence that Congress needs to take action to protect the privacy and safety of social media users," Democratic Senator Mark Warner said in a statement.
'I hope to get an answer to Reuters' report on the security breach, 'Rohit Chopra, a member of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), said on Twitter.

China News Agency, Yichang, October 1 (Guo Xiaoying Liu Min) The newly revised Regulations on Navigation Dispatch of the Three Gorges-Gezhouba Water Conservancy Hub (hereinafter referred to as the "Dispatch Rules ") were officially implemented on October 1. After two years of trial navigation, the Three Gorges ship lift was officially dispatched in a unified manner with the lock.
On the first day of the implementation of the new regulations, the navigation order in the waters of the Three Gorges-Gezhouba was good.
The Three Gorges Navigation Administration of the Yangtze River issued its first security plan at 2100 hours on September 30 and conducted security checks on 160 ships, with a total of 124 ships passing the security checks.
At 1400 hours on 1 October, the navigation department arranged the first crossing plan after the implementation of the new regulations.
After the implementation of the new regulations, the security plan will be issued once a day at 9: 00pm and 21: 00pm each, and the dam crossing plan will be issued once a day at 14: 00pm and 20: 00pm each to facilitate the flexible arrangement of the dam crossing plan by ships.
The Dispatch Regulations add the principle of "classification control" for the dispatching of ships over the dam, clarify the priority order of ships crossing the dam according to the functional positioning of the lock and the ship lift respectively, and adjust the short-term passenger ships crossing the lock to the same priority level as the demonstration ship and the integrity ship.
This is also the second anniversary of the trial operation of the lift, the official unified dispatching with the lock.
And the Sichuan River and the Three Gorges Reservoir area large long and wide demonstration ships, new energy power ships are also in the priority level for the first time.
At the same time, the Dispatch Regulations adjust the "navigation dispatching management waters" from the previous 180 km of near-dam waters to 541.8 km of water from the Yuanyang Yangtze River Bridge to the Shishou Yangtze River Bridge, and divide "core waters, near-dam waters, control waters and dispatching waters".
This is conducive to the ship's choice of suitable waters for the sluice, reducing the backlog of ships in the dam area.
The Dispatch Regulations also, in accordance with the current characteristics of ships crossing dams and waiting for sluice, put forward integrity control measures such as the cancellation of the declaration of ships that violate the law and the 24-hour delay in crossing the dam.
After the Three Gorges Reservoir, the navigation conditions in the reservoir area have been improved, promoting the rapid development of Yangtze River shipping.
According to the data, the annual cargo pass of the Three Gorges Lock and the Gezhouba Lock increased from 34.3 million tons in 2004 to 138 million tons and 140 million tons in 2017, respectively.
In the past two years, the Three Gorges ship-lift has passed through 5,767 ships, with 162,200 passengers and a cargo volume of 1.728 million tons.
Chen Dong-yuan, deputy director of the Three Gorges Navigation Administration, said the Dispatch Regulations play a positive role in promoting the management of good faith crossing the gate, maintaining the navigation order of the two dam hubs, unlocking the pressure on ships in the dam area and enhancing the navigation capacity.

With the signature and approval of Premier Li Keqiang, the State Council has recently issued the Decision on Further Reducing the Catalogue of Administration of Production License for Industrial Products and Simplifying the Approval and Approval Procedures.
The Decision proposes to further reduce the catalogue for the administration of production licenses for industrial products, eliminate the administration of production licenses for 14 categories of industrial products, and decentralize the authority for the administration of production licenses for four categories of industrial products to the quality and technical supervision departments of the people's governments at the provincial level.
As a result of this reform, the number of products that implement the administration of production licenses for industrial products will be reduced from 38 categories last year to 24 categories at present.
The Decision makes it clear that a simplified examination and approval process will be implemented for products in the catalogue.
The first is to change the pre-certification product inspection organized by the license-issuing organ to the product inspection qualification report issued by the qualified inspection and testing institution submitted by the enterprise at the time of application.
Second, in addition to hazardous chemicals, the products licensed by the quality and technical supervision department of the people's government at the provincial level (the market supervision and administration department) shall be subject to post-on-site examination. After submitting the application and the product inspection qualification report and making a commitment to ensure the quality and safety of the products, the enterprise may obtain a production license after passing the formal examination, and then accept on-site examination within the prescribed time.
Third, if an enterprise produces different categories of products in the catalogue of production and operation, it shall, in accordance with the principle of "one enterprise, one certificate", examine and issue a license together when applying for a new license or applying for a new license.
The Decision requires that all regions and relevant departments should firmly promote the work of reducing the catalogue and simplifying the examination and approval procedures.
We will strengthen the public announcement of the commitments of enterprises and the on-site examination of the latter, strengthen the means of credit supervision and restraint, implement the main responsibility for the quality of enterprises, and revoke the production license for all those who make false commitments and do not meet the requirements.
For products that have abolished the administration of production licenses for industrial products, post-facto supervision should be effectively strengthened. Products involving public health and safety and environmental protection may be converted into mandatory certification, a positive list may be listed and made public to the public, certification standards shall be unified, and testing projects shall be rationally reduced and certified. In principle, the cost of compulsory certification shall be borne by the finance at all levels in accordance with the system.
Take support measures to encourage enterprises to carry out voluntary certification, promote the establishment of brands and expand the market.
We should mark the advanced international standards and promote the improvement of the quality of industrial products.
Give full play to the role of third-party social organizations to ensure the quality and safety of industrial products.
For products that retain the management of production licenses for industrial products, we should improve the standard system, give full play to the advantages of industry supervision, strengthen the responsibility of "who approves and who supervises", dynamically assess the risks of product quality and safety, reduce the catalogue in due course, decentralize the examination and approval authority or convert it into certification management.
In September, China's comprehensive PMI ring ratio raised the manufacturing PMI ring ratio fell.
In September, China's composite PMI output index stood at 54.1%, up from the previous month and the annual average of 0.3 and 0.1%age points, according to data released by China's National Bureau of Statistics on the 30th, indicating that the production and operation activities of Chinese companies remained generally stable.
In the month, the manufacturing production index and the non-manufacturing business activity index, which make up the composite PMI output index, were 53.0% and 54.9%, respectively, down one litre.
Among them, China's manufacturing PMI was 50.8%, down 0.5%age points.
Zhao Qinghe said this month's manufacturing PMI had five main characteristics:
First, manufacturing fundamentals are generally stable.
Of the 21 industries surveyed, PMI in 14 industries was in the expansion range, with manufacturing PMI, such as medicine, special equipment and electrical machinery and equipment, all at a higher operating level of more than 53.5%, with a faster growth rate.
Second, there are small fluctuations in supply and demand.
The production index and the new order index were 53.0% and 52.0%, down 0.3 and 0.2%age points, respectively, from the previous month, while supply and demand remained buoyant, but expansion slowed slightly.
The new export order index and the import index were 48.0% and 48.5%, down 1.4 and 0.6%age points, respectively, from the previous month, with the boom both falling to annual lows.
4th, the cost of purchasing raw materials for enterprises has increased.
The purchase price index for major raw materials was 59.8%, up 1.1%age points from the previous month, while the factory price index was 54.3%, the same as the previous month, both at year highs.
5th, the operation of large enterprises is sound, and the operating conditions of small enterprises continue to improve.
The PMI for large companies was 52.1%, the same as the previous month, and the index has been in an expansion range of 52.0% and above so far this year, and both the production index and the new order index have risen this month, making it the main driver of manufacturing expansion; the PMI for medium-sized companies was 48.7%, down from 1.7%age points the previous month and in the contraction range; and the PMI for small companies was 50.4%, up from 0.4%age points the previous month, up for two consecutive months.
China's non-manufacturing business activity index stood at 54.9% in the month, up 0.7%age points from the previous month and recovering for two consecutive months.
Zhao Qinghe believes that the non-manufacturing industry as a whole continues to maintain a steady and positive momentum of development.
The index of business activity in road transport, securities, real estate and other industries continues to be below the tipping point, and the total volume of business has decreased.
Nagoya, Nov 5 (Reuters) -Japan's central bank is aware that a long-term ultra-loose monetary policy could squeeze profit margins in financial institutions and could destabilize the country's banking system, President Kuroda Kuroda said on Monday.
But he said the Bank of Japan needed to maintain its massive stimulus package while keeping a close eye on the pros and cons of its policies, given low inflation and uncertainty in overseas economies.
"The Bank of Japan fully recognizes that the strength of financial institutions will be increasingly affected under continued monetary easing," Kuroda said in a speech to business leaders in Nagoya.
He said the banking system could be volatile in the event of a serious negative impact if financial institutions were more active in taking risks to make up for the narrowing of profit margins caused by years of low interest rates.
"Although these risks are not significant at the moment, the central bank will closely monitor the situation and encourage financial institutions to take the necessary measures," he said.
The minutes of the Bank of Japan's meeting, released earlier on Monday, showed that at its September interest-rate meeting, the Bank of Japan's policy committee discussed the rising cost of long-term easing.
The minutes show that one member said that if the economy continues to expand, "the Bank of Japan has more room for policy flexibility in the future."
The minutes showed that another member said the committee should discuss how long the Bank of Japan could maintain the stimulus, given the limitations of the policy's duration.
Kuroda said the Bank of Japan would assess the financial risks posed by easing, as well as the uncertainty surrounding Japan's economic outlook, which could affect global demand as a result of trade frictions between China and the United States and rising protectionism.
"The impact of such problems on the Japanese economy is limited for the time being," Kuroda said.
"But how the problem continues, the impact on the Japanese economy is likely to grow," he added.
"There is a need for sustained strong monetary easing, while considering the positive and negative effects in a balanced way," Kuroda said.
While the drawbacks of the aggressive stimulus program have increased, such as long-term low interest rates eroding the profits of financial institutions, low inflation has forced the Bank of Japan to maintain the program.
The Bank of Japan maintained monetary policy last month; Mr Kuroda ruled out a near-term interest rate hike in the face of the risks posed by a global trade war dispute.
The corporate logo on a Tesla electric car in Cardiff, U.S., June 1, 2018.
Under a settlement, Tesla Motor Co. and its Chief Executive Officer Masque have agreed to each pay a US $20 million fine to financial regulators, and Masque will also resign as chairman of the company but remain CEO.
The settlement will put an end to two months of turmoil at Tesla.
The settlement of securities fraud charges, revealed by the Securities and Exchange Commission on Saturday, will give investors a sigh of relief.
Investors had feared the protracted legal battle would only further hit the electric car company, which is still losing money.
The SEC on Thursday sued Masque for fraud, saying its August 7 tweet misled investors.
The tweet said he was considering privatizing Tesla for US $420 a share and had secured financing.
The SEC said the tweets were virtually unfounded and that the market turmoil they triggered hurt investors.
Investors and corporate governance experts said the agreement could strengthen Tesla, which has been hit hard by Musk's recent behavior.
Steven Heim, head of asset management at Boston Common, said the settlement should have put Masque under more supervision and did not take "devastating" measures to drive him out of Tesla.
The asset management company holds shares in Tesla's battery maker Panasonic.
Under the proposed agreement, Tesla must appoint an independent chairman, two independent directors and a board of directors to develop controls over Musk's external communications.
"It is in the best interests of our market and our investors, including Tesla shareholders, that this matter be resolved expeditiously on agreed terms," SEC Chairman Clayton said in a statement.
Thursday's allegations led to an evaporation of about US $7 billion in Tesla's market value, which stood at US $45.2 billion on Friday, down from GM's US $47.5 billion.
In the settlement, the SEC withdrew its request to remove Masque from the helm of the company.
Many investors said the penalty would be catastrophic.
"I think this is the best possible outcome for all concerned," said Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial Partners, who gave Tesla a "neutral" rating and said the SEC's punishment was a "lighter punishment" for Masque.
"It's important to Tesla that he remains CEO."
Neither Masque nor Tesla acknowledged or denied the SEC's allegations in the settlement and did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The settlement agreement still needs to be approved by the court.
Beijing Morning News (reporter Wang Ping) A reporter from the Beijing Morning News recently learned from the Beijing Construction Industry Group that for the first time, the Beijing World Garden Performing Arts Square project, one of the core buildings of the Beijing World Garden Park in 2019, will adopt a multi-color ETFE jigsaw film structure. The 5,440-square-meter film structure will show six colors: dark red, dark green, orange, blue, red and green, and will present the shape of a "butterfly exhibition wing" under the pull of the Lasso steel line.
According to Liu Changbao, head of the project of the Beijing Construction Industry Five Construction Group, the Performing Arts Square project has an area of 4,500 m2 and a total of 1,182 tons of steel used for installation. The steel structure roof is supported by 26 umbrella-like hanging steel trusses, which show the shape of a "butterfly wing" under the pull of the Lasso steel strands.
"Overlooking the Performing Arts Square from the air, the colorful roof is like wearing flowers, dancing butterflies, and the bright colors will not fade over time and the wind, frost and snow".
Previously, the monochrome ETFE film structure had been widely used in the Bird's Nest, Water Cube and other projects, but the multi-color jigsaw ETFE film structure was the first in the country.
Reporters learned that because there are very few suppliers with a variety of color film structure production capacity in the world, so every inch of film structure materials are very "precious".
In order to avoid problems such as overlap and "fighting" at the end of the cable head, the "double-fork ear" cable head structure will also be innovated to ensure that the "fight" cable head is in the right position through a special fixed plug-in, Liu said.
At present, the construction of the 2019 Beijing World Garden Park is under way.
Among them, the International Pavilion project has completed all the "flower umbrella" hoisting construction.
It is planned that the project will be ready for exhibition by the end of October.

Zhang Xianghua, a Chinese-American entrepreneur and philanthropist, said China's achievements in reform and opening-up were "truly remarkable" and that he was heartily proud as a Chinese.
Liu Yuanji, a "after 90" who works in Los Angeles, said most of the photo records took place before he was born and did not know it.
"Looking at it slowly in chronological order, we feel that China is coming step by step and getting stronger and stronger, which is particularly heartening to us in a foreign country," Liu said.
Many overseas Chinese, not far away, returned to China to take part in the celebrations.

Expanding imports is not a matter of rights and interests, but a long-term consideration for the future, with China's imports of goods and services expected to exceed US $30 trillion and US $10 trillion, respectively, over the next 15 years.
In a keynote speech at the first China International Import Expo, Xi will further reduce tariffs, accelerate the development of new industries such as cross-border electricity companies, continue to relax market access, promote the opening up of services, and ease restrictions on the ratio of foreign capital stocks in areas such as education and medical care, which have large gaps in the domestic market.

After countless gusts and showers, the sea is still there!
After more than 5,000 years of hardship, China is still there!
Facing the future, China will always be here! "
He pointed out that economic globalization had been hit by ups and downs, multilateralism and the free trade system had been hit, instability and uncertainty were still many and risk challenges had intensified. Open cooperation was an important driving force for enhancing international economic and trade cooperation, and all countries should adhere to opening up and integration, expand the space for mutually beneficial development and strengthen macroeconomic coordination.

Xi said everyone can be optimistic about China's economic development prospects.
Xi said China's macro-control capacity has been increasing and has many favorable conditions for maintaining long-term, healthy and stable economic development. At present, China's economic development has also encountered outstanding contradictions and problems, and measures are being taken to actively resolve them, and the results have been and are becoming apparent.
"We believe that as long as we maintain strategic determination, deepen reform and opening-up in an all-round way and resolve outstanding contradictions and problems, China's economy will be able to accelerate its transition to a high-quality development track." Xi said.

General Secretary Xi Jinping delivered a very important speech at the symposium on private enterprises, injecting firm confidence in the private economy to move to a wider stage.
General Secretary Xi Jinping's emphasis on "letting entrepreneurs unload their ideological baggage and move forward lightly" has struck a strong chord among entrepreneurs and innovative entrepreneurs.
Market vitality comes from people, especially from entrepreneurs, from entrepreneurship.
In the magnificent course of 40 years of reform and opening-up, there have been millions of stories of entrepreneurs starting their own businesses and innovation, and the growth and growth of the group of entrepreneurs has continuously promoted the breaking of China's economy.
For some time now, some people in the society have made some negative and skeptical comments about the private economy.
The so-called "private economy departure theory" and "new public-private joint venture theory" have caused some entrepreneurs to doubt and worry.
Recently, some private enterprises have encountered many difficulties and problems in their operation and development.
For example, the changes in the international economic environment have had an impact on some export enterprises; the rapid adjustment of the demand structure has put pressure on transformation and upgrading; some policies are not coordinated with each other, the policy effects are superimposed in the same direction, or the working methods are simple, resulting in the opposite effect of some policies that were originally good.
All kinds of factors are intertwined, the private economy has encountered difficulties, some private enterprises are facing difficulties in their operations, and entrepreneurs have shown a lot of anxiety.
In this context, it is of particularly profound practical significance to correct misunderstandings in understanding, unload the ideological burden of entrepreneurs, let enterprises seek development with one heart and one heart, and the government promote development with one heart, which is a matter of market confidence and development expectations.
At this symposium, the important assertion that "three have not changed" was once again stressed: "The status and role of the non-public sector of the economy in China's economic and social development have not changed!"
From further promoting the decentralization of power and establishing a power list system to creating an environment under the rule of law that protects the legitimate rights and interests of entrepreneurs, creating a market environment of fair competition and shaping an atmosphere of respect for entrepreneurs in the whole society, in recent years, the Central Committee of the Party has attached unprecedented importance to entrepreneurs and institutional guarantees.
The symposium also clearly put forward six policies and measures to strongly support the development and growth of private enterprises, and launched a series of practical actions committed to the "light clothing forward" of private enterprises.
These are a great encouragement to the group of entrepreneurs and more expectations for all sectors of the community.
The fog has opened, the policy has been set, the key lies in the implementation.
We should continuously create a better environment for the development of the private economy, help private enterprises solve the difficulties in their development and help to realize the transformation and upgrading of China's economy. We should make entrepreneurs feel fair in market competition, feel safe in legal operations, feel respect in social life, and stimulate the vitality of innovation and create potential.
China's economy has entered the process of high-quality development, requiring more entrepreneurs to display their aspirations and providing more space and stage for entrepreneurs to develop their creativity.
We have reason to believe that with the further deepening of reform and the removal of obstacles, the private economy will usher in better prospects and opportunities for development and move to a wider stage.
All 46 kinds of supervision certificates in Inner Mongolia import and export links realize network verification-China New Network
China New Network Hohhot November 5 (reporter Li Aiping) Hohhot Customs said on the 5th that from this date, except for special circumstances such as the need for confidentiality, all 46 regulatory certificates in the local import and export links have been verified on the Internet.
Inner Mongolia enterprises can declare the relevant documents to the Customs in a paperless manner, avoiding the problems of on-site running, paper applications and repeated submission in the past.
It is understood that the preparation time of documents refers to the preparation time of all kinds of documents needed for the import and export link before the declaration of customs declaration. It is a major factor affecting the overall customs clearance time. In order to reduce the customs clearance time and reduce the customs clearance cost, the documents must be reduced.
Previously, there were 86 kinds of regulatory documents that needed to be verified by the Customs in the import and export chain, involving 19 departments.
It is reported that this time, in accordance with the principle of "cancellation that can be cancelled, merger that can be merged, and exit port verification that can be withdrawn from port verification", and relying on the "single window" platform for international trade, the Customs and 16 other license-issuing organs have been systematically docked and data interconnected, thus achieving more data running roads and fewer errands for enterprises.
The Customs said that in the past, enterprises had to go back and forth to and from the on-site office hall of the relevant departments to submit paper applications, the process was long and it was not possible to track the audit status in real time.
Enterprise users can now log on directly to the "single window" portal to apply online.
After the examination and approval of the license-issuing department, the certificate will be transmitted electronically to the Customs, and the automatic comparison with the customs declaration data will be realized in the customs clearance process, and the results of the intelligent verification and examination will be fed back to the enterprises through the "single window", thus realizing the full-process online processing of the declaration, examination, customs clearance and feedback of the regulatory documents.
Exports of Korean ginseng chicken soup to China soar 20-fold in four years or related to the increase in empty-nested youth-China New Network
Analysis of the 20-fold increase in exports of Korean ginseng chicken soup to China in 4 years: related to the increase in empty-nested youth
South Korea's exports of chicken soup to China exceeded US $100,000 last year, up about 20 times from 2013 four years ago, the ROK news agency reported on Friday.
According to the analysis, this increase is related to the increase in the number of empty-nested young people in China, which has led to the hot sale of convenient food, as well as the increase in young people's attention to nutritious food.
The data was released by the Korea Agricultural and Aquatic Food Circulation Commune (aT) on 5 days.
Last year, South Korea's exports of ginseng chicken soup to China reached US $103.339 million and weighed 218.59 million kilograms, up 2,094% and 3668.8% respectively from 2013.
According to the analysis, the increase in sales of South Korean ginseng chicken soup in China is related to the increase in the number of empty-nested young people driving the hot sale of convenient food, as well as the increase in young people's attention to nutritious food.
As of this year, China's one-person households have exceeded the 200 million mark and are expected to increase to 30% of the total population by 2020, and local food companies have also targeted "single-meal people" to launch a variety of convenient food.
In addition, the analysis said bird flu was the biggest factor preventing ginseng chicken soup from taking root in the mainland Chinese market.
aT said there was an outbreak of bird flu in South Korea from November 2016 to April last year, and authorities completely banned the export of ginseng chicken soup to China, leading to a sharp decline in exports.
Exports of ginseng chicken soup to China reached US $840,000 in 2016, and exports plummeted to US $100,000 last year due to bird flu.

China-Vietnam border estuary port holds national gate flag-raising ceremony to celebrate National Day
"I can't think of such a majestic and spectacular flag-raising ceremony in the frontier, which is more shocking than watching the flag-raising in the mainland." he said.
On the morning of the first day, Mr. Zhang, who came from Sichuan to visit the Yunnan Estuary Port on the border between China and Vietnam, and more than 500 troops, resident people and Chinese and foreign tourists watched the flag-raising ceremony at the national gate to celebrate the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
The estuary port is the largest port in the Yunnan section of the border between China and Vietnam. It is located in Hekou County, Honghe County, Yunnan Province. It is across the river from Laojie City, Vietnam. It is a national port.
With the deepening of the construction of the country's "one-way road", as one of the most convenient channels for China to connect Southeast Asia, the entry and exit flow of the estuary port has increased steadily.
At 7.30 am on the same day, the sun had just revealed a corner, and the restricted area of the estuary port gathered early local people and Chinese and foreign tourists from the estuary who had come to watch the flag-raising ceremony.
At 0745 hours, the flag-raising ceremony began on time, and the members of the honor guard at the national gate of the estuary border checkpoint were in high spirits and escorted the flag to the flag-raising platform at a vigorous pace.
After the commander issued the flag-raising instructions, the flag-lifter struggled to wave his arm to draw an arc. The bright five-star red flag, like the "eagle's wings", unfurled the flag, and rose slowly with the strong melody of the national anthem.
"The holding of the National Day flag-raising ceremony at every time of great significance, such as New Year's Day, Spring Festival and National Day, not only shows the image of China, but also inspires the patriotic feelings of the people of all ethnic groups in the border areas." he said.
The honor guard officers and soldiers who attended the flag-raising ceremony said.
It is reported that the national gate honor guard, which is responsible for the flag-raising ceremony at the estuary port, is composed of more than 40 officers and soldiers from various posts at the estuary border checkpoint, from a three-member flag-raising team to a large-scale honor guard. The team has gone through a history of more than 60 years and has carried out more than 70 national foreign affairs activities since its establishment.
The newly revised personal income tax law has adjusted the standard for determining taxpayers of personal income tax residents in China from one year to 183 days.
China's Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation said on the 30th that in order to maintain policy stability, the next step in implementing the new personal income tax law will be to consider continuing to make preferential arrangements for overseas people, including people from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
The person-in-charge said that the current regulations on the implementation of the personal income tax law have special preferential provisions on the issue of tax payment for overseas people. Individuals who have no domicile in China but have resided for more than one year and less than five years may pay personal income tax only on the part paid by units or individuals within China for their income derived from outside China.
The portion paid abroad does not require personal income tax to be paid within China.

During the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, some positive messages were released on the issue of the Korean peninsula.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in relayed North Korea's "irreversible" determination to abandon nuclear weapons and said U.S. President Trump and North Korea's top leader, Kim Jong Un, could meet by the end of the year.
The State Department later said Secretary of State Pengpeo would visit North Korea in October to push for the implementation of the promise of a meeting between U.S. and North Korean leaders in Singapore.
Since the beginning of this year, the two Koreas have broken the ice and opened the road to dialogue, the leaders of the two Koreas and the United States have met, the general trend of easing the situation on the peninsula has continued, and the principle of dialogue to resolve the peninsula issue has been adhered to.
First of all, the fact that "the essence of the peninsula issue is a security issue" has not changed. The key to achieving peace on the peninsula is to properly and balance the legitimate security concerns of all parties, rather than to put pressure on each other and emphasize their own demands.
Second, in the dialogue to achieve the denuclearization of the peninsula, the parties concerned are still divided on the steps and ways to achieve the denuclearization of the peninsula. Due to the long-standing lack of political trust between the DPRK and the United States, the game thinking of "who comes first and who comes later" remains strong.
At a recent public meeting of the Security Council on the Korean Peninsula held at United Nations Headquarters in New York, different voices from all sides on the issue of sanctions against North Korea once again highlighted the "unchanged" two points on the peninsula issue.
U.S. Secretary of State Pengpeo has insisted that sanctions against North Korea will not be lifted until the Korean peninsula is fully denuclearized.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, for his part, stressed the principle of "responding to action with action," noting that "the weakening trend of sanctions should be the same as the steps taken by North Korea on the road to gradual nuclear disarmament".
There is no doubt that the parties concerned should continue to implement the Security Council resolution on the DPRK in a comprehensive, complete and accurate manner, but pressure is not an end. The implementation of sanctions and the promotion of a political settlement are the requirements of the Security Council resolution.
As Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, in view of the current positive developments in inter-Korean and inter-Korean relations, China believes that it is necessary for the Security Council to consider the timely launch of reversible provisions, thus encouraging the DPRK and all parties concerned to take greater steps towards denuclearization.
Looking back, the denuclearization of the peninsula and every progress in the peace process required sufficient political courage from all sides.
At present, in the face of the growing expectations of the international community to promote a political solution to the issue on the peninsula, all parties concerned should, in particular, show political vigour, make political decisions, implement their commitments, resolve difficult problems, continue to take steps towards each other, promote the process of denuclearization of the peninsula in parallel and establish a peace mechanism on the peninsula, so as to jointly create permanent peace on the peninsula.
The people's government of Ji County, Linfen City, Shanxi Province, reported on the first day that during the National Day, the Hukou Falls Scenic Area of the Yellow River, located in the county, will maintain a relatively high water level and will not have the conditions for opening up.
In order to ensure safety, the scenic area was temporarily closed during the National Day.
The Hukou Falls of the Yellow River is the second largest waterfall in China and the largest yellow waterfall in the world.
At this point, the Yellow River is running, the stone walls on both sides of the Taiwan Straits are steep, and the estuary is as narrow as the Hukou, forming the spirit of "a pot of the Yellow River".
According to reporters, June-October of each year is the flood season of the Yellow River. Starting from July 12, 2018, due to the high water level of the Yellow River, the Hukou Scenic Area of the Yellow River in Shanxi Province has been closed, so the Hukou Scenic Area has been closed for nearly a month.
Ni Yufeng, chief engineer of the Hukou Scenic Area Management Committee, told the media that it was the longest period of high water levels in the Yellow River in nearly 20 years. "It has not been so long before. Our flood season is closed for four days in 2017, and this year is nearly a month."
It is understood that the Hukou Falls Scenic Area of the Yellow River in Shanxi Province was originally intended to welcome the Golden Week of the 11th National Day, but also increased personnel arrangements and vehicle maintenance in advance, and even the employment of temporary staff have been put in place.
According to the Notice on Doing a Good Job in Flood Control of the Yellow River during the National Day, issued by the Office of the Yellow River Flood Control and Drought General Command, Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan and Shandong Province are required to do a good job in flood control of the Yellow River during the National Day.
At present, the flow of the main stream of the Yellow River is large, with the flow of the upstream river remaining at 2000-3,000 cubic metres per second, the flow of the middle reaches of the river remaining at 2500-3,500 cubic metres per second, and the flow of the downstream river remaining at 3,000 cubic metres per second.
Health centres and health stations provide influenza vaccination services during National Day holidays
The Health Bureau has ordered 150,000 doses of the four-price influenza vaccine for 2018-2019 this year. At this stage, priority is given to free vaccination for high-risk people. To facilitate residents to be vaccinated against influenza during the holidays, health centres and health stations under the Health Bureau provide vaccination services from 9 a.m. to 1 noon during the National Day holiday (1 and 2 October).
In addition to the above measures, the health centres and health stations under the Health Bureau have extended their influenza vaccination services from Monday to Friday to 8 p.m. since the launch of the programme. As at 4 p.m. on 30 September, 4,158 people had been vaccinated, up from 3,714 in the same period last year.
The free vaccination targets include the following Macao residents: persons aged 6 months to under 18, aged 50 and over, pregnant women, all people with chronic diseases, including obese people (i.e. those with a BMI of 30 or more), as well as staff of institutions, nurseries, kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, all health workers, and Macao residents working in betting casinos.
At the same time, if the Health Bureau considers it necessary to vaccinate other persons, including the public sector, the Health Bureau will contact the relevant organisations on its own initiative to obtain the list and arrange the vaccination by the Health Centre.
To facilitate vaccination and reduce the waiting time for vaccination, the Health Bureau will send medical staff to secondary schools, primary schools, kindergartens and nurseries in Australia between October and December this year to vaccinate young children, small and medium-sized students, teachers and staff against influenza. In addition, the Health Bureau will arrange for staff to carry out group vaccination in homes for the elderly and the disabled, the public sector or other institutions with a large number of people.
Students and young children who have not been able to take part in the group vaccination can be vaccinated at the vaccination station or health centre of the Earl of Yan General Hospital with a Macao Resident Identity Card, a Health Bureau User Card, a Influenza Vaccination Card (if any), a student card, a staff card or a vocational certificate from 3 December 2018.
The Health Bureau has reminded residents that people who have been vaccinated against the 2017-2018 flu between September 2017 and August 2018 will still need to be vaccinated against the new season of the flu from September 2018, as the flu antigen ingredients contained in the 2018-2019 northern hemisphere flu vaccine have been updated to target seasonal influenza in the northern hemisphere for the winter of 2018-2019 and the summer of 2019.
The peak period of influenza in Macao usually occurs from January to March of each year, later than in temperate regions (such as northern China and Japan). The Health Bureau calls on high-risk people, such as the elderly, children, pregnant women, obese people and people with chronic diseases, who are more likely to develop complications after contracting influenza, as well as those who are in frequent contact with high-risk people, to be vaccinated as soon as possible.

On the evening of the 29th, the reporter learned from the Propaganda Department of the Qingbai River District Committee of Chengdu that on the night of September 29 Beijing time, a Central European liner (Chengdu) loaded with car connectors, telescopes, LCD screens and other goods was replaced and transferred through the port of Shimianufka, Poland, and finally arrived in Nuremberg, Germany.
This is the first time that China's Central European liner has opened the Polish Shimianufka port line, marking the successful opening of another European transport line after Mara and Jopu.
The Central European train, which started on September 14 from the Qingbai River City Station in Chengdu, left the country via the Alashan Pass, entered Europe through the Polish port of Shimianuvka, and finally arrived in Nuremberg, Germany, for a total of about 16 days.
For the first time, the Central European liner is here to carry out the replacement of the wide rail and the standard rail.
The opening of the port has effectively solved the problems of long-term operation and long-term time caused by the current congestion at the Mara Port, raised the time limit for liner transport. It has also provided a new solution to the problem of congestion at the Mara Port, further improved the carrying capacity and transport efficiency of the hinterland of western China to the European Mediterranean market, and laid a solid foundation for the development of the European market by the Central European liner.
More than 400 people have been confirmed dead after a 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday, many of whom were swept away by tsunami waves triggered by the earthquake.
Authorities expect a significant increase in the total number of deaths on Sunday as new figures are reported in remote areas.
Dozens of people are reportedly still trapped under the rubble of a hotel and a shopping centre in the city of Baru.
Large waves of up to six meters (20 feet) triggered by the earthquake hit the city of Baru.
So far there have been only deaths from Baru, the death toll in Dungra, north of Baru, has been slow to report and authorities are preparing for a worse situation.
Dungra has a population of 300,000, closer to the epicenter of the quake.
Indonesian Vice President Kara said the total death toll could rise to thousands.
As the waves hit the coast at dusk on Friday, hundreds of people gathered on the beach to celebrate the festival, many of whom were swept away by the waves, destroying everything wherever they went.
TOKYO, Oct 1 (Reuters) -Confidence among Japan's big manufacturers hit its lowest level in more than a year in the September quarter as rising raw material costs and a series of natural disasters affected production, putting pressure on companies, according to the Bank of Japan's quarterly short-view survey released on Monday.
The survey shows little evidence that escalating global trade frictions have hit the confidence of big manufacturers.
But the risk of a full-scale trade war has hit business prospects and could threaten capital spending.
Active capital spending is a bright spot in the Japanese economy.
The survey raises questions about the Bank of Japan's view that robust economic expansion will help push inflation to accelerate to its 2% target, despite signs that companies are gradually passing on costs to customers.
"In the face of concerns raised by a global trade war, confidence among manufacturers has stagnated due to slowing exports and weak factory production," said Nan Wuzhi, chief research fellow at the Institute of General Cooperation in Agriculture and Forestry.
"Confidence is still high. And because corporate profits are improving and prices are rising, I don't think confidence will continue to decline." he said.
The short-view survey showed that the large manufacturing boom judgment index fell to positive 19 in September from positive 21 three months ago, the third consecutive quarter of deterioration.
The median market estimate is positive 22.
The large non-manufacturing boom judgment index fell to positive 22 in September from a positive 24 in June, the first deterioration in eight quarters.
The Reuters survey was positive 22.
According to the survey, the large manufacturing and non-manufacturing boom judgment index is expected to hold steady in December.
Investors were unconcerned about the decline in the short-term corporate boom judgment index, with Japan's Nikkei. N225 rising to a 27-year high on Monday as the continued depreciation of the yen helped improve the export profit outlook for Japanese companies.
Capital expenditure is robust.
Despite the decline in corporate confidence, the latest short view highlights the soundness of corporate capital spending plans, helped by renewing capacity, and increased investment in robotics and automation to cope with labor shortages caused by an ageing population.
Large companies plan to raise capital spending by 13.4% in the current fiscal year, which ends in March 2019, according to the central bank's short-view survey.
In the previous short-view survey, it was 13.6%.
Mr Nan said all corporate capital spending plans to grow by 8.5% this fiscal year, close to the pace of Japan's bubble economy.
"Given that small companies have raised their profit estimates from now on, there is still room for further growth in capital spending, but much depends on the impact of a trade war on corporate confidence." he said.
The short-view survey showed an increased ability of companies to pass on costs, with the output price index of large companies at a positive 7, a decade high, an encouraging sign of progress in Japan's efforts to combat deflation.
The index, which measures the employment status of large enterprises, hit minus 23, the most tight level since 1992, highlighting the tightening of the job market.
Japan's economy rebounded in the second quarter from a contraction in January-March this year, benefiting from strong corporate spending.
But the escalation of trade frictions over the summer and the disruption of supply chains by natural disasters have clouded the outlook for Japan's export-dependent economy.
In dollar terms, imports and exports of services grew by 16.4%.
The head of the Department of Services and Trade was quoted in a press release on the website of the Ministry of Commerce as saying that the total import and export of emerging services exceeded 1 trillion yuan in January-August, a faster growth rate than the overall.
Of these, the total import and export of emerging services amounted to 1138.39 billion yuan, an increase of 20.9%, 10.4%age points higher than the overall growth rate of imports and exports of services, and an increase of nearly 3%age points in the proportion of emerging services.
In terms of services exports, from January to August, services exports continued their rapid growth momentum so far this year, with exports growing 5.7%age points faster than imports.
Among them, the top three areas of growth were telecommunications computer and information services, personal culture and entertainment services, and insurance services, with growth rates of 61.1%, 38.8% and 26.5%, respectively.
The head of the Department of Trade in Services also pointed out that the proportion of imports of emerging services had also gradually increased in January-August.
From January to August, imports of emerging services grew rapidly, accounting for 23.6% of imports of services, an increase of 1.6%age points over the same period last year.
Of these, imports of financial services, intellectual property royalties, telecommunications computers and information services all grew by more than 20%, at 47.1%, 23.3% and 23.2%, respectively.

Oil prices or usher in a "three-in-a-row" National Day self-driving travel can be filled with oil in advance.
BEIJING, Sept 30 (reporter Qiu Yu) September 30 at 2400 hours, a new round of refined oil price adjustment window will be opened simultaneously with the National Day holiday.
A number of agencies predict that oil prices will rise sharply, achieving a "three-in-a-row".
Owners who plan to drive themselves can fill their cars with oil before the price increases.
According to the data measured by Longzhong Information, the corresponding increase in domestic refined oil is expected to be about 190 yuan / ton, while the increase measured by Zhuo Chuang Information is 220 yuan / ton.
In September, oil prices have already been raised twice: on September 3, gasoline was raised by 180 yuan / ton and diesel by 170 yuan / ton; on September 17, gasoline was raised by 145 yuan / ton and diesel by 145 yuan / ton.
Domestic oil prices are linked to international oil prices, and since the current pricing cycle, international oil prices have risen in shock, and Brent crude oil has continued to explore after breaking through the US $80 mark.
U.S. WTI crude futures closed up US $1.13 at US $73.25 per barrel as of the close on September 28.
Brent crude futures closed up US $1.0 at US $82.72 per barrel.
"In terms of the international situation, tensions such as U.S. sanctions against Iran were superimposed, and the overall trend of oil prices was strong.

Zhuo Chuang information refined oil analyst Zang Wengang said.
On the retail side, the current prices of petrol No. 92 and No. 95 at PetroChina and Sinopec gas stations in Beijing are 7.66 yuan / litre and 8.15 yuan / litre respectively.

The 69th International Astronautical Congress opens in Germany-China New Network
Bremen, Germany, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The 69th International Astronautical Congress kicked off on October 1 at the Bremen Convention and Exhibition Center in Germany, attended by more than 6,300 astronauts, representatives of space agencies and enterprises, experts, scholars and young students from all over the world.
Speaking at the opening ceremony, the President of the International Astronautical Federation, Jean-Yves Le Gal, said that the global space industry was no longer attended by only a small number of countries and institutions, and that the number of participants this year had increased significantly from the previous session, indicating that more and more institutions and people were joining it.
He called on all countries to strengthen cooperation and innovation and jointly promote the development of the space industry.
Zhang Kejian, Vice Minister of Industry and Information Technology of China and Director-General of the National Space Administration, introduced China's space program at the exchange and said China would expand international cooperation in the field of space and contribute to the space industry of mankind.
Representatives of relevant institutions such as the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation and the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, as well as some private enterprises, attended the meeting to showcase the latest achievements of China's space industry, including launch vehicles, satellites and space science and technology applications.
The International Astronautical Congress, which has been held annually since 1950, is the largest event in the world's aviation industry.
The five-day conference was co-sponsored by the International Astronautical Federation, the International Academy of Astronautics, the Centre for Applied Science and Technology and Microgravity Research of the University of Bremen and the International Society of Space Law.
BEIJING, Nov 5 (Reuters) -The Canton Fair shows that China's foreign trade situation remains complex and severe, with 80.6% of companies expecting exports to be better or flat for the whole of 2018 than the previous year, according to a press release issued by the China Foreign Trade Center on Sunday.
However, taking into account the external environment in which the cost of comprehensive factors such as domestic raw materials and labor continues to rise and the impact of trade frictions between China and the United States has increased, the exhibitors also believe that the export situation next year is not optimistic.
At the closing press conference of the 124th Canton Fair, Xu Bing, deputy secretary-general of the Canton Fair, press spokesman and deputy director of the China Foreign Trade Center, said that the number of overseas buyers and export transactions at the Canton Fair had fallen slightly year-on-year.
There were 189,812 buyers from 215 countries and regions, down 1.11% year-on-year.
Exports traded 206.494 billion yuan (US $29.86 billion), down 1% year-on-year.
In terms of the market, transactions with Japan, the 10 ASEAN countries, the BRICS countries and South Korea increased by 74.4%, 11.4%, 7.2% and 2.5% respectively, while traditional markets such as the United States, Australia, Canada and the European Union fell by 30.3%, 8.9%, 7.3% and 0.8% respectively.
In terms of industry, means of transport, machinery and equipment, construction and decorative materials, consumer electronics and information products and sanitary equipment increased by 24.8%, 21.1%, 20.0%, 15.1% and 7.6% respectively, while textiles, clothing and household appliances fell by 13.0% and 6.7% respectively.
Xu Bing said that, as a barometer and weathervane for China's foreign trade, the participation of buyers at the Canton Fair and the export transaction data show that China's foreign trade development still faces many uncertain and unstable factors next year.
However, with the in-depth progress of supply-side structural reform and the recent introduction of policies and measures in the areas of "six stability" by the state and local governments, the new momentum of China's foreign trade development is accelerating its accumulation and new progress has been made in the diversification of the enterprise market, all of which are important foundations and strong conditions for the development of foreign trade.
"Taking into account all factors, it is expected that China's foreign trade imports and exports will maintain steady growth throughout the year, with further improvement in quality and efficiency." Xu said.
China's General Administration of Customs reported that dollar-denominated exports rose 14.5% year-on-year in September and imports rose 14.3% year-on-year, with a trade surplus of US $31.69 billion in September, with export growth and trade surplus both the highest since February.
Despite the escalating trade frictions between China and the United States, China's export performance in September still significantly exceeded expectations, strong external demand, and the devaluation of the RMB exchange rate by companies before the United States imposed tariffs, or the main supporting factors, also show the resilience of China's foreign trade to some extent, but the impact of the China-U.S. trade war on confidence and on the industrial chain is not to be underestimated, and analysts believe the challenges to China's foreign trade are likely to emerge in the 4th quarter or next year.
U.S. fund managers recommended increased cash holdings in September and continued to be cautious as the United States and China began the latest round of import tariffs and the dispute showed no signs of easing, according to a Reuters survey.
But asset allocation in North America rose to its highest level since June 2017, while positions in the UK, the euro zone, especially emerging markets, fell, according to the 12 fund managers involved in the survey.
Global stock allocation averaged 56.6% and bonds accounted for 35.5%, largely in line with last month's survey.
The most obvious change was the rise in the cash ratio to 5.1%, the highest since December 2014.
"Some economic data has brought confidence to the market, but a trade war is still the biggest concern, so it's best to be prepared to enter when the market falls back." said a fund manager at a large fund company.
But fund managers still preferred stocks, especially U.S. stocks, in September, even if U.S. stocks were considered high-priced.
Today, in Shanghai, China's open landmark, the world's first large-scale national exhibition on the theme of imports, the China International Import Expo, officially opened in the expectation of the public.
An exhibition is like a "window" to give the world a better understanding of a city and a country.
Through the "window" of the Expo, people see a move towards a higher level of "open China". With the help of the "window" of the Expo, the world is welcome to be mutually beneficial and win-win with China, which is "reform and opening-up again".
"For a country, opening up is like breaking a cocoon into a butterfly, although it will experience a moment of pain, but it will be a new life."
General Secretary Xi Jinping's summary of the road to openness sets out an important reason for "why China can."
Looking back on the 40 years of reform and opening-up, China, which has dared to plunge into the sea of the world market, has always faced all risk challenges in an open manner, continuously released endogenous momentum and continuously improved its competitiveness, although it has encountered vortices and winds.
It can be said that China, with its own practical achievements, has strongly interpreted the value and significance of opening up.
Standing at a new historical starting point, the holding of an import-themed fair is a major decision made by the Party Central Committee, with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, with a view to promoting a new round of high-level opening-up to the outside world. It is a major step for China to take the initiative to open its markets to the world. It is a practical action by China to support economic globalization and trade liberalization. It demonstrates the strong and clear will that "the door to China's opening will not be closed, but will only open more and more".
Exhibitors from all over the world have signed up enthusiastically, and the "one hard to find" booth is the greatest recognition and best response to China's development of an open economy on a wider scale, in a wider field and at a deeper level.
More importantly, the current global economic and trade order has reached a crossroads.
Some countries have built a high wall of trade protectionism and returned to the old path of unilateralism, increasing the international community's concern about the prospects for free trade and adding a lot of uncertainty to the recovering world economy.
Against the backdrop of such an era, the event on the banks of the Huangpu River reflects China's defence of free trade, allowing the world to see open markets and share China's self-confidence and China's responsibility for the future.
Walk fast alone, walk far away.
China has opened its mind and embraced the world, not only vigorously promoting its own development, but also bringing a surge of "China opportunities" to all countries and regions of the world.
In recent years, we have advocated and promoted the joint construction of the "Belt and Road", launched the establishment of the Asian Investment Bank and set up the Silk Road Fund... China has provided a series of international public products, provided real export markets, development opportunities and jobs, and allowed enterprises from all over the world to take the "express train" of China's development.
The Expo is also such a public product, a big platform for global economic and trade cooperation.
On this platform, more than 3,000 enterprises from more than 130 countries and regions have taken a new step in the Chinese market with their own high-quality products and services.
In addition to national enterprises, it is domestic consumers who really benefit.
By setting up this platform of "optimal progress", it has provided a multi-channel high-quality supply for consumption upgrading to meet the individualized, diversified and differentiated consumption needs of the people.

Foreign media: The United States and Canada reach a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The agreement includes Canada's opening of its dairy market to the United States and the temporary non-imposition of tariffs on Canadian-made cars by the United States.
A Canadian source revealed on the night of September 30 local time that the United States and Canada had reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement, foreign media reported.
It was revealed that the agreement included Canada's opening of its dairy market to the United States and the temporary non-imposition of tariffs on Canadian-made cars by the United States.
On the 27th of last month, the United States and Mexico announced a preliminary agreement in principle on updating the North American Free Trade Agreement, but the United States and Canada failed to reach an agreement by the August 31 deadline set by the United States to extend the talks until September 30.
Earlier, a spokesman for Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland said Canada would only sign a favourable agreement, "focusing on the substance, not the timetable, and we will continue to consult in the hope of reaching an agreement that is in Canada's national interest."
More than 90% of Brazilian women voters said the presidential candidate did not take into account the needs of women.
More than 90% of Brazilian women do not believe that presidential candidates take into account the needs of women, according to data released recently by Brazil's National Institute of Geography (IBGE), according to the South American Overseas Chinese News Network.
The number of women in Brazil has now reached 107 million, and if women from all over Brazil are brought together to form a country, the country will be ranked 13th in the world, more than twice the population of Spain, the report said.
In Brazil, women accounted for 52% of the total number of voters and men for 48%, and although the proportion of women in the electorate was very high, women accounted for only 10% of the country's Congress.
Of the world's 193 countries, Brazilian women are ranked only 154th in political participation, higher than Arab countries.
After more than 20 years of power struggle, Brazilian women still have not succeeded in gaining their rights.
Natalia Mori, a Brazilian sociologist, points out that the reason for this phenomenon is the result of a combination of ancient patrilineal societies, racism and capitalist values.
"Politics should have been for nationals to claim civil rights, identity, access to public goods and form the same society by multiple social groups, but Brazilian politics is the monopoly of a certain group and the majority of the population is not represented." he said.
A previous study by the Brazilian Institute of Locomotive Research also noted that 94% of Brazilian women do not feel that elected politicians can represent their rights, 90% do not agree with the decisions made by politicians and 93% do not agree with the current government's governance policies.
"We need to reverse the underrepresentation of women in parliament, and Brazil's political system is still affected by inequality. So far, there is still serious gender, class and racial discrimination in Brazil's political sphere." Natalie Murray said.
Despite the lack of women's rights, most Brazilian women still believe in the power of democracy.
According to the survey, 76% of women think they can make a difference in democratic elections, and 72% are interested in politics.
In addition, 55% of women believe that democratic politics is the best way to expose women to less prejudice.
Astana, October 1 (reporter Wen Longjie) The Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan held a solemn flag-raising ceremony on October 1 to welcome New China's 69th birthday.
More than 80 librarians of the Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan, representatives of news organizations in Kazakhstan, financial institutions, Chinese enterprises, overseas Chinese, the Confucius Institute and international students participated in the event.
On October 1, the Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan held a flag-raising ceremony to welcome the 69th birthday of New China.
After the flag-raising ceremony, China's ambassador to Kazakhstan, Zhang Qiao, said that on the occasion of the 69th birthday of the great motherland, we held a grand flag-raising ceremony in a foreign country, which was a profound patriotic education event.
Although we have lived overseas for a long time, we are always in the heart of the great motherland.
Zhang said the Chinese nation is today closer than ever to achieving the great goal of national rejuvenation and closer than ever to the middle of the world stage.
"Our mission, responsibilities and work are more glorious, arduous and onerous than ever."
Zhang stressed that we should not forget our first heart, bear in mind our mission, promote the joint construction of the "one-way road" between China and Kazakhstan to travel steadily and deeply, draw up a more beautiful "one-way road" and "brush painting" for the joint construction of the "one-way road", and devote all our efforts to the development and construction of the motherland and China-Kazakhstan friendly cooperation.
Terminal T2 of Guilin Shuangjiang International Airport in Guangxi was officially opened on the 30th.
Zhao Leqin, secretary of the Guilin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), said that the opening of the new terminal could meet the annual passenger throughput demand of 12 million, build a new advantage in Guilin's air traffic, and is of great significance to further improve the modern three-dimensional traffic pattern of Guangxi's river-sea linkage, sea-rail intermodal transport, water-land parallel and air-port connection.
Guilin is expected to receive more than 90 million visitors this year.
The expansion of Terminal T2 and the supporting facilities of Guilin Two Rivers International Airport is a major public welfare project to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the founding of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, as well as a landmark project for the construction of Guilin's international tourist resort.
The project began in December 2015 with a construction area of 100,000 square metres and a total investment of 3.258 billion yuan. When completed and opened, it will meet the annual passenger throughput of 12 million, 1.012 million sorties and 95,000 tons of cargo and postal throughput.
On the same day, more than two hundred flights took off and landed at Terminal T2 of Guilin Shuangjiang International Airport.
The design of the new terminal is inspired by the mountains and rivers of Guilin. It is like a "mountain and water crown" from a distance. It is like the "dragon ridge terraces" and the layered eaves of residential buildings in northern Guangxi. It is reflected in the mountains and rivers of Guilin.
According to the report, the new terminal of Guilin Airport can meet the peak flow of nearly 4,000 people entering and leaving Hong Kong per hour. It has used "smart airport" technical means such as intelligent baggage sorting system, security integration platform and face recognition, and has planned a business district covering a variety of businesses, such as catering, department stores, tax exemption and leisure and entertainment.
With growth in Europe, Asia and emerging markets mostly not encouraging, the United States is increasingly becoming the main engine of global economic growth.
A container freighter moored inside the port, New Jersey, U.S., September 23, 2018.
But the economy is also under close scrutiny as current growth in the United States has benefited from the time gained by the fiscal stimulus of tax cuts.
"As the United States is returning to full employment, an economic downturn is inevitable." he said.
The only question, he said, is when it will happen and, in his view, it may only come early and not push back.
While Barclays is optimistic about the outlook for the U.S. economy by the end of the year, the bank admits it is more difficult to make forecasts for a longer period of time.
"In the absence of more sustainable investment growth to boost economic growth potential, current fiscal policy-inspired growth will be unsustainable," Barclays economists said in a research note.
"At a time of lack of investment growth, the risk of a hard landing for the economy in 2020 will rise," they said.
A series of business surveys will show roughly where the major economies are in the economic cycle at the end of the third quarter.
The euro zone and U.S. manufacturing surveys, scheduled to be released next Monday, will be watched, and the services survey will be released on Wednesday.
But the focus of next week's data is bound to be on U.S. non-farm payrolls data, to be released next Friday, which will provide clues as to whether the tight job market is driving a sharp rise in wages.
It is important not only because it is important for corporate profitability and the purchasing power of consumers, but also because a jump in wages or a rise in overall inflation could unsettle Federal Reserve / FED officials.
"Salaries will be of great concern because they are likely to rise sharply again from the previous month.
The increase in September from a year earlier may not exceed 3%, but we can fully expect it to break through next month, "ING economists wrote in a research note.
Europe's political situation is likely to be a source of market volatility at a time when holidays in China and the rest of Asia lead to light data in the region next week.
The Italian government has ignored previous financial commitments to the EU, and other EU member states will have to quickly determine whether to firmly oppose Italy's decision, which Tria does not support and wants to abide by EU rules.
As the Brexit talks enter a critical phase, the Conservative Party's annual meeting in Birmingham is also likely to spark.
Meanwhile, concerns around emerging markets are unlikely to wane as Brazil holds a much-anticipated presidential election next weekend.
When completed, the ship will be delivered to the East China Sea Branch of the State Oceanic Administration of China. Chen Zhi, director of the observation department of the Marine Early Warning and Monitoring Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China, said the launch of the ship would be of great significance to the development of China's offshore marine observation system and the promotion of global marine observation.
On September 29, China's first 3,000-ton large-scale buoy ship, Xiangyang Red 22, was launched at China's Wu Ships Group.
When completed, the ship will break the current equipment bottleneck in China's security work such as large buoys, submersible marking, recycling and emergency repairs.
The "Xiangyang Red 22" ship is mainly used for regular inspection and maintenance of buoys / submersible marks, regular placement, recovery, emergency placement, recovery and emergency repair of buoys / submersible marks. It also has the ability to carry out comprehensive marine investigation tasks such as cross-section investigation.
The new ship has a total length of 89 metres, a width of 18 metres, a depth of 7.2 metres and a capacity of 10,000 nautical miles.
Wang Weiling, deputy general manager of Wu Shipboard Group, said: "Xiangyang Red 22 is the first large-scale buoy operating ship in China and the only working ship in China with the ability to lift a 10-meter large-scale buoy, which will further enhance China's large-scale buoy support capacity."
It is understood that when completed, the ship will be delivered to the East China Sea Branch of the State Oceanic Administration of China for use. Chen Zhi, director of the observation department of the Marine Early Warning and Monitoring Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China, said the launch of the ship would be of great significance to the development of China's offshore marine observation system and the promotion of global ocean observation.
"The ship, which also has large-scale buoy laying and maintenance operations, as well as a comprehensive marine survey capability, is the first comprehensive ship in our country dedicated to buoy operations and comprehensive marine surveys in the middle and far seas.
With such a buoy operating ship, we will have a strong tool for ocean observations and marine surveys in the future.
Qingdao, Oct 1 (Xinhua) -- Affected by Typhoon Tam Mei, the 2018 International Limit Sailing Series Qingdao Station "Mazelun Cup", which was scheduled to open on September 30, postponed its first race day until October 1, and held a pre-match meeting at the Qingdao Olympic Sailing Center before the match. All 12 water-wing double-body sailing team captains from six countries and regions appeared.
As a result of the sound of Typhoon Tam Mei, strong winds continued in the Hong Kong pool, with a maximum wind speed of up to 24 knots. The departure signal was delayed by nearly 90 minutes from 1pm on the 30th. The wind speed was still not reduced. The tournament's chief referee, Anne Mudrand, announced the cancellation of the first day of the match and the postponement of the match until the afternoon of October 1.
"The strong winds from the shore continued, and the sea conditions were too intense."
"In this case, no one knows when and with what wind the gusts are blowing towards the racing boat," Mudrand explained.
Close to the city, in the current wind conditions, cancelling the game is the smartest choice. "
There was still some disappointment for all the ready crew.
"The race boat is ready to stop and we are in good shape."
Qingdao's helmsman, Max Richardson, admitted: "But I know the rescheduling of the race is the right choice, and I hope the wind is smaller today and we can show our hand."
"The loss of a day makes the game more interesting," said Omika Wilkinson, the "star of hope" known as the New Zealand team for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
Because the weight of today's game will increase, and there are only two days left to play.
Everyone's going to be particularly desperate. '
Despite the strong sea breeze, Pierre Ives Durand, the helmsman of the French ABM team, appealed at a pre-match meeting about his warm past with Qingdao, where the competition was held: five years ago, the International Limit Sailing Series suffered an accidental injury and a broken muscle, and thanks to the handling of the local event's medical team, he was able to stand at the venue five years later.
It is reported that the International Limit Sailing Series was founded in 2007 and is known as the World Sailing League with Volvo, the Copa America and the World Sailing Challenge Tour.
The Qingdao Station competition will use the "Flying Ghost" water-wing two-body sail.
2018 marks the 8th year that the event has landed in Qingdao, the "sailing capital," and Qingdao Station is also the closing battle for the series.
Despite the continued turmoil in global financial markets, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said on Monday that investment income from foreign exchange funds fell 97% annually in the third quarter of this year, but better than in the previous quarter, as overseas stocks rose and foreign exchange losses narrowed significantly under the China-US trade war.
According to the latest data from the HKMA, the Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK US $1.6 billion in July-September 2018, down sharply from HK US $61.8 billion in the same period last year, but better than the revised HK US $100 million in the second quarter of this year.
Speaking in the Legislative Council, HKMA President Mr Chan Tak-lin said that at the beginning of the China-US trade war, Hong Kong and emerging market stock indexes ran counter to the US stock index. Until the end of September and after the US stock index peaked in early October, market sentiment began to reverse as investors gradually realized that the trade war was also bad for the US itself.
"It is a good thing that there is a change in market sentiment, and if a trade war has only a unilateral impact, it will not help solve things." he said.
But he also pointed out that "if the trade war between China and the United States is not resolved, financial market volatility will continue to rise."
In the third quarter of this year, the Exchange Fund's stock investment losses in Hong Kong narrowed by 8% to HK $4.7 billion from the previous quarter, while overseas stock investment earnings rose 172% to HK $12.8 billion. Foreign exchange losses of HK $16.2 billion and bond earnings of HK $9.7 billion, down 24% and 31% on a quarterly basis, respectively, mainly reflecting a general rise in the US dollar against major currencies during the quarter and a rise in the US yield rate of 3% in mid-September.
The Exchange Fund is mainly used to support the Hong Kong dollar.
Hong Kong has implemented a linked exchange rate system between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar since 1983.
As for the current financial situation in Hong Kong, Mr Chan said that uncertainty in the economic and asset markets had increased and downside risks had increased, but that Hong Kong's financial system was sound, defensive and earthquake-resistant.
"Hong Kong has a rich international investment position, with an external net worth of US $1.4 trillion equivalent to four times GDP, 2.5 times higher than Singapore's and 0.6 times Japan's, and it is more than enough to cope with the downward cycle or reversal of the economy." he said.
Recently, the Hong Kong dollar's interest rate has continued to fall and the spread with the US dollar has widened. Mr Chan pointed out that the Hong Kong dollar's exchange rate had risen by more than 400 basis points on 21 September. It was widely believed that it was mainly related to the rise in the Hong Kong dollar's interest rate. Since then, the Hong Kong dollar has hovered around 7.80-7.84 against the US dollar. In the recent past, the Hong Kong dollar's interest rate has continued to fall and the spread with the US dollar has widened, which may attract the market to sell Hong Kong dollars and buy US dollars, making the Hong Kong dollar more likely to trigger a weak exchange guarantee again than in the previous period.
But he believes the situation of Hong Kong dollar interest rates below the US dollar rate will change in the future as the Bank of Hong Kong's rate hike cycle begins and the normalization of Hong Kong dollar interest rates is under way.
"The Hong Kong dollar interest rate will be more in line with the US dollar interest rate, and we must be more careful to manage risks and be prepared to cope with market fluctuations." he said.
The three-month interest rate fell 0.9% to 2.08179% on Monday, widening the spread with the US dollar from 46 basis points to 51 basis points, while the one-month interest rate hit a five-month low, widening the spread with the US dollar from 120 basis points to 127 basis points.
From May to mid-September, the spot exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar was close to 7.85 to the US dollar for most of the time.
During the period, the weak-party exchange guarantee was triggered several times in May and August, after it was first triggered in April, due to factors such as the outflow of some of the funds from the prospectus from the Hong Kong dollar after the end of the arbitrage campaign and the large-scale prospectus.
The HKMA buys Hong Kong dollars and sells US dollars at the 7.85 level in accordance with the linked exchange rate system to maintain the stability of the Hong Kong dollar.
The HKMA bought about HK US $52.1 billion in May and August under the Weak-side Exchange Guarantee Mechanism.
Does the new tax law still have preferential treatment for overseas people?
In response to a reporter's question on the 30th, the relevant officials of the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation said that in order to maintain policy stability, the next step in the implementation of the new personal income tax law will be to consider continuing to make preferential arrangements for overseas people, including those from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
A reporter asked, the newly revised personal income tax law has adjusted the judgment standard for individual income tax residents in China from one year to 183 days.
In the next step in the implementation of the Law, are there any preferential arrangements for overseas people, including those from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan?
In response, the person-in-charge said that the current regulations on the implementation of the personal income tax law have special preferential provisions on the issue of tax payment for overseas people. Individuals who have no domicile in China but have resided for more than one year but less than five years may pay personal income tax only on the part paid by units or individuals within China for their income derived from outside China.
The person in charge said that in order to maintain policy stability, the next step in the implementation of the new personal income tax law will be to consider continuing to make preferential arrangements for overseas people, including those from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
There is no "threshold" moon center: quality certification promotes quality improvement.
With the pull of the "two-child economy" and the prosperity of the mother-and-child market, from the north to the third-and 4th-tier cities, various grades of moon clubhouses have sprung up in various places.
The current hot moon clubhouse has met the consumer needs of the masses, with fees ranging from tens of thousands of yuan to hundreds of thousands of yuan, but it is also in an awkward position. The agency has no threshold so far and there is still a gap in supervision.
The State Administration of Market Supervision recently launched a series of activities for the 2018 National "Quality Month". The reporter came to a five-star moon center in Tianjin to visit the certification experience of maternal and child care services.
The general moon center provides neonatal care, nutrition meals, postpartum repair plastic shape and other services.
In this moon center, the reporter saw that nurses check the breastfeeding of newborns every day, and professional nursing workers provide fine care services such as bathing and touching for newborns.
At the same time, in order to meet the needs of new mothers, from wound care in the early stages of the moon to beauty care in the middle and late stages of the moon, nursing projects such as Chinese medicine treatment and beauty are provided to help mothers regain their fair figure.
A new mother who lives told reporters that she had only booked for the moon club eight months in advance.
The service items of the moon clubhouse directly affect the comfort and physical recovery of the mother during the month. Some small moon clubhouses can only provide some simple moon services. There are hidden dangers such as irregular disinfection and hygiene, easy cross-infection, and unscientific diet.
The head of the moon center said they were the only one of all five-star moon centers in Tianjin to be certified for B-level services.
"Although some customers did not understand the meaning of B-level certification at first, it is of great significance to the long-term development of the enterprise to force companies to strictly standardize process management through certification to benefit customers." he said.
Pan Lifen, deputy director of the Certification and Supervision Department of the State Administration of Market Supervision, said that service certification is a new type of certification system based on customer perception, paying attention to organizational quality management and the satisfaction of service characteristics. It is an important part of the national quality infrastructure and plays a positive role in increasing the proportion of high-quality service supply and enhancing the international competitiveness of China's services.
Since 2004, after more than 10 years of development, the service certification project has gone through a process of gradual development from scratch, and a number of influential service certification, such as financial service certification, mother-and-child care service certification, commodity after-sales service certification, e-commerce service certification and health service certification, have emerged.
According to statistics from the State Administration of Market Supervision, there are more than 130 service certification institutions in China, more than 2,000 service certification personnel and nearly 8,000 valid certification certificates.
Mr Pan said the development of service certification should be further guided and promoted, the coverage of service certification should be gradually expanded in the fields of health, education, sports, finance and electricity business, and the supply-side reform and quality improvement of the service industry should be promoted.
HONG KONG, Nov 5 (Reuters) -Hong Kong property prices have fallen for two months in a row after peaking, with the head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Mr Chan Tak-lin, saying on Monday that it would take time to see if the property market had entered a downward cycle and that if confirmed, consideration could be given to easing the tightening of counter-cyclical measures at an appropriate time.
Mr Chan also said that if property prices were to be revised back, it would be those who bought property at the peak of the property market who would be the first to be affected. However, it was expected that there would be a sharp fall in property prices, such as during the 1997 Asian financial crisis, and that the chances of the public selling property at a significant price reduction would be much lower.
Speaking at the Legislative Council briefing, Mr Chan, who led a number of senior HKMA officials, said that if it was confirmed that the property market had entered a downward cycle, the measures could be relaxed as appropriate.
"However, only a few weeks of data have been seen, and it is still too early to relax, and it will take more time to see if the property market is entering a downward cycle." he said.
Since October 2009, the HKMA has so far introduced eight rounds of counter-cyclical measures to significantly tighten mortgages for all types of properties, including reducing the number of mortgages and requiring mortgage applicants to pass rigorous stress tests to enhance banks' risk management and earthquake-resistant capacity.
As Hong Kong officially entered a cycle of interest rate hikes, the Hong Kong private residential price index peaked for two consecutive months in August-September, with the monthly decline widening to 1.44% in September.
But the cumulative increase in the first three quarters of this year was still 10.2%.
According to the HKMA, the financial situation of households that measure Hong Kong's earthquake-resistant ability to face financial risks remains healthy. In the second quarter of this year, the proportion of self-occupied households without a mortgage in Hong Kong reached 66%, higher than the average of 60% in 2009-11. The average number of new mortgages granted and the contribution-to-income ratio of new mortgages granted were 47% and 34% respectively, a marked improvement from 64% and 41% respectively in 2009-11.
But Mr Chan said the high earthquake-resistant capacity did not mean that people who had already bought a home would not be damaged by the economic downturn, as property valuations would fall and those who bought a building during the peak period would bear the brunt.
Although the HKMA has tightened bank lending to mortgage lenders, home buyers can also obtain a high number of mortgage loans through mortgage insurance or mortgage loans provided by developers.
Mr Chan said that at present, together with the mortgage loans provided to developers, the number of mortgages for borrowers could reach 85-90%. If the price of the property fell by 10%, there would be negative assets (i.e. the market value of the property fell below the total amount of outstanding mortgage loans).
However, the Vice-President of the HKMA, Mr Nguyen Kwok-heng, pointed out that the authorities estimated that the total number of mortgages provided by developers was only 2-2.5% of the total number of bank mortgages, which was still low.
At the peak of negative assets in Hong Kong in 2003, the number of negative assets exceeded 100,000, accounting for 22% of building suppliers.
As of the third quarter of this year, Hong Kong had recorded zero negative assets in seven consecutive quarters.

SHENZHEN, Oct 1 (Zheng Xiaohong Xu Dian-wei Liu Shu-meng) On October 1, the first day of the "Golden Week" of the National Day of the Mainland and the last day of the National Day public holiday in Hong Kong, many Mainland residents took advantage of their holidays to go out of the country to play and shop. Many Hong Kong residents who came to Shenzhen returned to Hong Kong on the same day. There was a "explosion" of passenger flow at various ports in Shenzhen. Twenty-two new self-help channels were opened at the Luohu and Shenzhen Bay ports to enhance the efficiency of customs clearance at the ports and facilitate efficient and efficient customs clearance for passengers.
According to the data provided by the Shenzhen Border Inspection Station, as of 16:00 p.m. on the same day, the number of people entering and leaving the Shenzhen Port had reached more than 429,000, and the number of means of transport had reached more than 168,000 (ships, frames and columns). The ports had always been busy and unruly, maintaining good entry and exit order.
It is understood that due to a number of positive factors, such as the increase in the number of countries providing exit visa-free policies for Chinese citizens, the number of passengers using the National Day holiday to travel to Europe and Southeast Asia for holiday shopping has continued to increase.
On the morning of the first day, the exit direction of Luohu, Shenzhen Bay, Huanggang, Fukuda and other ports welcomed the peak passenger (car) flow. Among them, the peak passenger flow at Luohu Port lasted from 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. and the peak passenger (car) flow at Shenzhen Bay Port was from 6:30 a.m. to 13:00 noon.
According to the report, in order to cope with the peak flow of passengers (vehicles) entering and leaving the country, the Shenzhen Border Inspection Station, in accordance with the unified deployment of the State Administration of Immigration, has launched the peak-hour service model of passenger (vehicle) flow, arranged for overtime police to support the front line of duty, opened full inspection channels in advance, guided passengers and vehicles to wait for inspection in an orderly manner, ensured that Chinese citizens are queuing for entry and exit customs clearance for no more than 30 minutes, while taking into account the efficiency of customs clearance for foreigners, and strengthened the maintenance of order in densely populated areas to ensure the safety and order of customs clearance.
At the same time, the Shenzhen Border Inspection Station reminds passengers entering and leaving the country to pay attention to the validity period of documents, visas and signings before travelling, arrange their trips rationally, avoid the peak hours of passenger flow as far as possible, and choose the right time and the right port to travel.
Passengers travelling to Hong Kong on the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong high-speed rail line are required to hold valid entry and exit documents and visa endorsement. High-speed rail tickets are only bus vouchers and cannot be used as entry and exit documents. If they are unable to leave the country for Hong Kong for reasons such as non-conformity of the documents, they should follow the guidelines of the Border Inspection Police and wait at a designated place for the staff of the MTR Corporation to take them to the Mainland for the ride.
Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic disease that involves multiple organs throughout the body and has been considered an "incurable disease" in the past.
Because its pathogenesis is unknown, diagnosis and treatment is difficult, lack of effective treatment methods and can not be cured.
Recently, a joint team of Liu Wanli, a researcher at Tsinghua University's School of Life Sciences, and Chiu Zhanguo, director of the Rheumatic Immunization Center at Peking University People's Hospital, found a molecular mutation in human immunoglobulin that increases the susceptibility of systemic lupus erythematosus, and that the mutation is involved in regulating immune B cells.
In short, the two teams confirmed that an abnormal immune molecule in the human body is a major cause of systemic lupus erythematosus.
According to Sun Xiaolin, one of the authors of the article and the People's Hospital of Peking University, the Chiu Zhanguo team collected nearly 2,000 large samples of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and conducted a study, and found that patients with immunoglobulin variants had produced pathogenic cells and a wide variety and large number of autoantibodies, and that the incidence and severity of inflammation such as nephritis, arthritis, serositis and vasculitis had increased significantly.
Through a variety of research methods, such as immune cell tracer, animal tests and sequencing, Liu Wanli's team found the immune signal pathway activated by immune molecular variation, which promotes the pathogenic mechanism of B cells secreting a variety of self-antibodies.
The reporter learned that the two teams are strong and strong, give full play to their respective advantages, and realize the close combination of basic research and clinical application.
Liu Wanli's team is committed to the study of B-lymphocyte immune identification and immune activation, while the Chiu Zhanguo team has long been engaged in the clinical study of systemic lupus erythematosus.
"This study is one of the results of many years of cooperation between the two teams and is the first time that the academic community has recognized that immunoglobulin genetic abnormalities will induce systemic lupus erythematosus, laying a solid foundation for further academic research and clinical targeted treatment." he said.
This is not short-term, but in accordance with the law.
A lawyer goes to court with an axe?
The news was really exciting at first glance, and it blew up in the legal circle.
Zhongfa, Quanzhou City, Fujian Province, then fined the lawyer 500 yuan and recommended in writing that the Quanzhou Bar Association investigate and deal with it.
According to the Beijing News, the Quanzhou Law Association issued an official notice saying that the actions of the two lawyers did not involve violations of the law and would not be punished in accordance with the law.
According to many reports, the treatment of the Quanzhou Law Association is not short-term or confrontational, but has been approved by the Quanzhou Central Court.
An incident that could have caused tension within the legal community was finally properly resolved.
The reversal of the matter stems from a more complete restoration of the truth: the axe carried by the lawyer involved is of the same style and model as the defendant's murder weapon, but it is not open-edged, only as auxiliary evidence in the examination of evidence, and there is no subjective intention to intimidate or "endanger the safety of the court".
There are four very important details to pay attention to in judging whether the actions of the lawyer involved are illegal and illegal: first, the local court has held two previous sessions, showing only photos of the axe, and from a defence point of view, it is necessary to show the original object of the axe; second, the axe was purchased only an hour before the court session, not because the lawyer did not want to seek the consent of the judge, but objectively failed to contact the judge; third, the whole axe was not used too much or improperly; and 4th, the lawyer involved publicly apologized to the court for the first time.
Combined with these circumstances, it can be seen that the lawyer involved "appeared in court with an axe" had nothing to do with evil, but only for the purpose of defence.
After clarifying the whole fact, the Quanzhou Law Association did not push the boat, but resisted the pressure to make the decision not to punish.
And this decision, also can stand the test of facts and law.
As for bringing the axe, which is used as a control tool, to court without the permission of the court, it is indeed easy to cause unease and misunderstanding.
For reasons of safety and caution, the Quanzhou Central Court's previous fine penalties and judicial recommendations are also not unreasonable.
In order to safeguard the dignity of lawyers and prevent individual courts from making it difficult for lawyers, the Supreme Law issued the Rules for the Safety Inspection of the Judicial Police of the People's Courts in 2014, establishing the principle that lawyers do not need to undergo a personal safety examination in court.
Since the rule was issued, lawyers have led by example, and there have been few incidents that endanger the safety of the court because of security loopholes.
In very rare cases such as Quanzhou, as long as communication is carried out in a spirit of mutual respect and understanding, misunderstandings are not difficult to eliminate.
As a self-discipline organization of the bar industry, the Bar Association is responsible for the dual mission of punishing wrongdoing and safeguarding legality.
In the past, individual law associations have been criticized for their emphasis on discipline and loss of protection.
And the decision of the Quanzhou Law Association, both in terms of process and results, is commendable, setting an example for more law associations to perform their duties correctly.
From October 1, which tax benefits will affect our money bags?
SHANGHAI, Oct 1 (Xinhua) -- The new personal income tax law will come into force on January 1, 2019. In order to enable the general public to enjoy the tax reduction dividend as soon as possible, from October 1, the income from wages and salaries actually obtained by taxpayers will be deducted at the starting point of 5,000 yuan per month, and the new tax rate table will be applied.
With the landing of the New Deal, what benefits will affect the people's money bags?
Good 1: The tax cut on income from wages and salaries is obvious
Taxpayers who receive wages and salaries after October 1 can deduct the basic deduction of 5,000 yuan / month and apply the new tax rate table. Most taxpayers have varying degrees of tax cuts, especially for low-and middle-income earners.
According to the tax reduction table of different income groups, the monthly income after deducting the "three risks and one gold" is 8,000 yuan, 10,000 yuan, 20,000 yuan and 50,000 yuan, and the amount of tax payable after the tax reform is 90 yuan, 290 yuan, 1,590 yuan and 9,090 yuan respectively. Compared with the monthly starting point of 3,500 yuan, the corresponding tax reduction ratio is 73.9%, 61.1%, 49.0% and 18.8% respectively.
It is worth noting that, for holiday reasons, the wages paid by units in accordance with the law at the end of September, which should have been paid in October, may be subject to the new basic cost reduction and tax rate table.
To this end, the withholding client software popularized by the tax authorities has provided the corresponding tax calculation function, but the corresponding tax still needs to be declared and paid within the statutory declaration period.
Good 2: The range of low-tax brackets has increased significantly
In addition to raising the threshold, the new tax rate table will be applied from October 1.
The seven-tier tax rate on income from wages and salaries is the same as before and has not changed, but there has been a marked change in the range of tax rates, with a marked increase in the range of low tax rates of 3%, 10% and 20%, a reduction in the range of 25%, while the range of higher tax rates of 30%, 35% and 45% has remained unchanged.
It is worth noting that the tax law has also adjusted the tax rates on income from production and operation, of which the lower limit of the top 35% tax rate has been raised from 100,000 yuan to 500,000 yuan.
This means that individual industrial and commercial households and sole proprietorship partnerships will all benefit from the tax reform.
"Judging from the previous calculation of individual tax cuts for Shanghai taxpayers, the vast majority of taxpayers will fully feel the dividends of individual tax reform, especially for low-and middle-income people." he said.
Lan Min, head of the personal income tax department of the Shanghai Municipal Tax Bureau of the State Administration of Taxation, said.
Good 3: Tax payment services are more convenient and optimized
Since the promulgation of the new personal income tax law, the Shanghai tax authorities have carried out a series of comprehensive and extensive tax publicity activities.
On the one hand, the key tax sources, key enterprises to carry out "one-on-one, point-to-point" policy guidance.
The Pudong New Area Tax Bureau has visited large enterprises such as Apple Trade (Shanghai) Co. Ltd., PayPal (China) Network Technology Co. Ltd. and Red Star Mekaolong Home Group Co. Ltd. These enterprises have a large number of employees, a large workload of withholding and payment, a large amount of tax payment, and the tax authorities have taken the initiative to help and answer questions. The Xuhui District Tax Bureau has visited large labor enterprises in the region, Zhongzhi Financial Consulting Co. Ltd. and Zhongzhi Shanghai Economic and Technical Cooperation Co., to collect the concerns of enterprises in a timely manner, respond to the demands of enterprises and solve the difficulties of enterprises.
On the other hand, to the general public taxpayers, carry out "all-round, multi-dimensional, three-dimensional" tax policy push.
Use the Shanghai tax official website, microblogging public number, microblogging and other channels to push policy hot spots in a timely manner to ensure that policy publicity is in place.
At the same time, since September 28, the Shanghai Tax Micro-Letter Public Number has been on the 12366 Intelligent Consulting Platform to carry out a "targeted" intelligent integrated individual tax reform publicity service through the "artificial + intelligent" tax service consultation.
Former England captain Wayne Rooney will return to the England squad for England's warm-up match against the United States on November 15, the FA announced on Thursday night.
In August last year, Rooney announced his retirement from the England squad.
Rooney, who has previously made 119 appearances for England and scored 53 goals, is the team's all-time top goalscorer and the second-highest number of appearances in history.
According to the FA's official website, the match against the United States was to raise money for Rooney's children's charity foundation, and Rooney himself was thrilled: "It's a pleasure to play for England at Wembley again and thank Southgate and the FA for inviting me to help my foundation.
Playing for England is the greatest glory of my career, the 120th and will be my last appearance for England, and it will be a special memory for me.
The annual Yangcheng Lake Crab Culture and Tourism Festival kicked off on the 30th. According to Gu Wenhua, party secretary of the town of Yangcheng Lake hairy crabs, the annual economic output value of the town's hairy crabs is nearly 3.8 billion yuan, with a net income of more than 600 million yuan.
Yangcheng Lake hairy crab, also known as the golden claw crab, because the crab body does not touch mud, commonly known as water hairy crab, green shell white belly, meat ointment is greasy, so it has a reputation as the "king of the crab".
Dangui fragrant golden autumn diet crab has become a common practice.
The hairy crab is the most well-known image spokesperson of Bacheng.
Peeling crab shells, sucking crab feet, picking crab meat, dipping crab material, diners feel the beauty of being in the south of the Yangtze River.
Jin Wei, a crab farmer, said more diners will spend more time in Ba City this year, watching egrets prey on the edge of the vast Yangcheng Lake, watching the sunset, experiencing the fun of catching crabs and enjoying a slow-paced life in the water countryside.
As a result of the widespread introduction of large-scale seedlings in the towns of Pakistan, the number of hairy crabs coming out of the water this year is much larger than in the past.
Chang Jianhua, a crab farmer who has been dealing with hairy crabs for nearly 20 years, is planning to export the crab seedlings and breeding techniques of Yangcheng Lake hairy crabs to Thailand to allow aquatic food to cross national borders and promote cultural exchanges with overseas food.
"Kunqu Town" is a cultural sign in Ba City.
At present, there are five major crab markets and food streets in Ba City, including Crab Boat Court, Fisherman's Lights, Spring and Autumn Water City, Linhu Crab City and Zhengyi Ba Xie Crab Market. There are as many as 1,300 restaurants and restaurants around Yangcheng Lake hairy crabs for catering business.
Gu Wenhua said that "a crab" attracts nearly 3 million tourists from home and abroad each year, and has also formed a two-horizontal, two-longitudinal, live-colored and fragrant old street in Bacheng.
Many tourism products, such as Kunqu Theme Post Office, Painting Concept Book, Powder Ink Baby Theme Image Pavilion, Kunqu Theme People's Hostel, Embroidery Pavilion and Cheongsam Pavilion, have appeared in succession. A number of celebrity studios, such as Kunqu scholar Yang Shousong, flute master Chen Dongbao, famous Kunqu Xiao Sheng Yu Jiulin, bamboo carving master Ni Xiaozhou and folk song inheritor Lu Zhenliang, have been stationed. Old Street has become the cultural core of the "Kunqu Town".
It is reported that during the Crab Culture and Tourism Festival, the 4th Kunqu town of Ba City Zhengyang Song Conference will also open again, and music friends from all over the world will gather to relive the Yushan elegant collection.
A number of cultural venues, such as the Bacheng Historical and Cultural Exhibition Center, the Kunqu Promenade, Aying Ya Court, Chongwen College and the Kunming Opera Grand Theatre, will also be unveiled, presenting the cultural charm of Kunqu Source Township, the Land of Chinese Calligraphy and the Fish and Rice Water Township in the south of the Yangtze River.
A three-way trade agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico will bring new opportunities to 500 million people.
The United States, Canada and Mexico have reached a three-way trade agreement, which will be known as the "USMCA" (the three-nation agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada), according to a joint statement by Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland and U.S. Trade Representative Wright Hezer published on the Canadian government's website, according to foreign media reports.
Earlier, Canadian television station CTV News, citing senior U.S. sources, said Canada and the United States had resolved their differences and reached an agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
The agreement reached between the United States and Canada on September 30 will retain the North American Free Trade Agreement as a three-way trade agreement, and the three heads of state will sign a new agreement within two months, the Washington Post reported, citing two sources familiar with the situation.
"Today, Canada, the United States and Mexico have agreed on a new trade agreement-the U.S .-Mexico-Canada Three Kingdoms Agreement (USMCA), which will provide high standards of trade agreements for our workers, farmers and companies, which will lead to freer markets, fairer deals and more sustainable economic growth, which will strengthen the middle class, create high-paying jobs and bring new opportunities to about 500 million people." the statement said.
It is reported that the current North American Free Trade Agreement was signed by the United States, Mexico and Canada in 1994.
After taking office, Trump announced plans to reconsider the agreement and sign a new one.
The three countries began this negotiating process in 2017.
The results of the early Okinawa governor's election, which was held as a result of the death of former Governor Weng Changxiong-zhi, were announced in the early hours of the morning local time, and Yucheng Danny, who opposed the plan to relocate the U.S. military base in Japan, was elected.
The final results of the election, which was counted on September 30, showed that Yucheng received 396.632 million votes, the highest number of votes in the history of the Okinawa Prefecture governor's election and more than 80,000 more votes than its main rival, Zo Hei-chun.
A total of four candidates took part in the election, with a turnout of 63.24%, down 0.89%age points from the 2014 Okinawa Prefecture governor election.
Yucheng told the media on Monday that the results of the election showed that the county people did not want Governor Weng's efforts to be in vain. He would inherit Governor Weng's legacy and continue to make efforts to the Japanese and U.S. governments to oppose the relocation of the U.S. military base and the closure of the Putian base.
The U.S. military base in Putian, located in the city of Yicano Bay, Okinawa Prefecture, has been criticized, with the Japanese and U.S. governments agreeing to move it to the Banyoku area of the famous city, but Okinawa people strongly oppose it in the hope of moving the base out of Okinawa.
In response to the relocation plan strongly opposed by the county people and the request to revoke the permit for land reclamation along the border, Yucheng said he had not been in a position of confrontation and division with the central government at first, and hoped that the two sides would have a full exchange of views and show their intention to resolve it through consultation.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also told the media on Monday morning that he seriously accepted the results and would make efforts to revitalize Okinawa and reduce the burden on the base.
Japanese Chief Secretary Yoshihide Suga said at a press conference on Monday that the government's policy on moving the U.S. military base as soon as possible had not changed.
At the same time, he also expressed his desire for talks with Yucheng.
Yucheng will officially take office as governor of Okinawa Prefecture on the 4th of this month.
Since the mid-2000s, Paul Thomas, a North Dakota farmer, has grown more and more soybeans in his fields as China's demand for oilseeds has grown.
The shift reached its peak this year, when he planted 1,600 acres of soybeans in 5,000 acres on an unprecedented scale.
But Thomas and many farmers like him plan to switch in 2019 to staple crops in former U.S. agricultural areas: corn and wheat.
U.S. farmers have grown more soybeans than corn this year for the first time in 35 years.
The reason for the plan to switch to other food crops is that U.S. farmers are struggling to sell soybeans against the backdrop of U.S. President Trump's trade war against China.
China usually buys about 60% of U.S .-exported soybeans, but has bought almost zero U.S. soybeans in recent months because of a trade war, sending soybean prices to a decade low.
Thomas plans to grow more wheat next year, hoping to earn more by reducing his dependence on crops that depend on Chinese demand.
Soybean prices have "hit us hard," Mr Thomas said.
Without Chinese buying, he said, the spot price for soybeans near his farm was US $7.10 a bushel, compared with US $8.50 necessary to cover costs.
U.S. farmers have hit a record high in soybean cultivation this year, and harvests are expected to hit a record high.
It was at a time when they were so vulnerable to shocks that they were hit by a trade war.
In response to Trump's imposition of tariffs on imports of Chinese goods, China imposed import tariffs on imports of U.S. soybeans in July.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture will release its first estimate of the area under cultivation next year, which is expected to include consideration of the impact of tariffs.
The estimate is expected to confirm the expectations of private institutions that soybean sown area will be reduced.
Informa Economics predicted on October 19 that corn cultivation would increase by 4% to 92.7 million acres (37.5 million hectares) and soybean cultivation by 7% to 83 million acres in 2019, according to a report seen by Reuters.
Informa also expects U.S. wheat cultivation to increase by 4%.
The area of soybeans grown before retaliatory tariffs rose to 89.6 million acres this year, about 15 million acres higher than a decade ago.
Corn cultivation has increased by less than 5 million acres to 89.1 million acres since 2008, and wheat cultivation this year stands at 47.8 million acres, close to its lowest level in 100 years.
Aron Carlson, president of the Illinois Corn Planting Association, who has a total of 3,600 acres, has spent nearly half of his time growing soybeans this year, but plans to cut them in the future.
He said he could increase corn cultivation by up to 20% at his farm in northern Illinois, the largest soybean-growing state in the United States.
Soybeans yield less per acre than corn, but require fewer fertilizers, making them generally less expensive to grow.
If farmers move to end-value corn, it may raise costs, but it will benefit a number of businesses, including Andersons Inc. fertilizer sellers.
Andersons Chief Executive Pat Bowe told Reuters he expected the switch to corn to be good for fertilizer use.
Bayer is also expected to benefit from the conversion of farmers to corn.
Thailand welcomes Chinese tourists and authorities will strengthen management, raise service awareness and avoid similar incidents, the head of Thailand's Langman Airport Authority in Bangkok, Sutirawa, said at a press conference on Tuesday, apologizing for the beating of a Chinese citizen at the airport.
According to the report, on the 27th, security at Langman Airport had a physical confrontation with a Chinese man who had been refused entry.
Sutilawa said the security guard involved had committed a serious violation of discipline and that the Airport Authority had suspended him and set up a commission of inquiry to investigate the matter in accordance with the procedure and would dismiss the security guard if the matter was true.
At present, the Thai Immigration Department has arranged for the man to return to China on the plane.
Sutirawa apologized for the incident, which damaged Thailand's image, and said the Thai side attached great importance to the matter, was willing to do its utmost to reduce the impact of the incident on the beaten tourists and would send a letter of apology to the parties through the Chinese Embassy in Thailand.
He said Langman Airport is willing to facilitate Chinese tourists to Thailand and, in conjunction with the Thai Immigration Service, has set up special entry channels for Chinese tourists at Thailand's five major international airports, including Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi, Langman, Chiang Mai, Phuket and Hai.
He said that the next step would be for the Airport Authority to rectify the land signing area, indicate the cost of the land signing, and improve the service quality and communication skills of the staff.
After learning of the matter, the Chinese Embassy in Thailand contacted the parties concerned at the first time to learn about the matter.
At the same time, representations were made to the heads of the Thai Immigration Department, the Airport Authority and the Ministry of Tourism and Sports, demanding that the Thai side thoroughly investigate the incident and severely punish the perpetrators, and that it would continue to maintain close communication with the Thai side, properly handle the matter and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the parties concerned.
Xinhua International Review: Defending Multilateralism, China's Knowledge and Practice in One.
At a time when unilateralism is surging against the current, international rules and the multilateral order have been hit.
To some extent, the confrontation between unilateralism and multilateralism has entered a critical period.
As a responsible power, China has worked with the international community to safeguard multilateralism and push it forward with the concept of following the trend and joining the road and solid and strong action.
In the face of the new situation and new challenges, China has made a loud voice on the direction and path of multilateralism.
As State Councilor and Minister for Foreign Affairs Wang Yi said in his speech at the general debate of the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, multilateralism in the new era should adhere to the goal of win-win cooperation, be based on rules and order, be based on fairness and justice, and be guided by effective action.
At the same time, China calls for the construction of a pattern of global development cooperation with the United Nations as its core, North-South cooperation as its main channel and South-South cooperation as its complement, and calls on all parties to work together to build a community of human destiny.
China's thinking and voice reflect the mainstream voice of the international community.
As the President of the 73rd session of the General Assembly, Espinosa, said, in the current situation, "more than ever, the United Nations needs to promote multilateralism and maintain a rules-based international system".
International Monetary Fund Managing Director Lagarde said the international community should continue to firmly uphold the multilateral trading system, adhere to international trade rules and resolve differences through consultation.
In recent years, with the adjustment of the balance of global economic and political forces, some groups of emerging markets and developing countries have risen to play a greater role in the major international multilateral mechanisms, providing a new impetus for the development of multilateralism, which has been hit by a headwind.
In this dimension, China's advocacy of building a large family rather than piecing together small circles, adhering to the concept of multilateralism such as joint construction rather than win-win eating, and in line with the trend of the times, is an inevitable choice to meet global challenges and solve world problems, and represents the common aspiration of most countries in the world.
With advanced ideas, more solid action.
China's "One Belt, One Road" initiative has become the largest platform for international cooperation.
China has launched international and regional cooperation initiatives such as the joint construction of the "One Belt and One Road", the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the "16 +1 Cooperation" to promote international and regional cooperation, improve and complement the existing international system and order, bring innovative vitality to multilateral cooperation and contribute to the development of the international order in a more just and reasonable direction.
As a defender of the international order and a practitioner of multilateralism, China's actions are becoming more and more powerful in the multilateral arena of the United Nations.
Good offices in international hot spots, combat climate change, participate in peacekeeping operations, vigorously reduce poverty and help other countries implement the 2030 sustainable development agenda.
As UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said, China has become an important pillar of multilateralism.
When the "trust deficit" facing the world intensifies, and when populist and polarization trends rise, it is the world's most urgent need for multilateral cooperation.
At such a historical juncture, the international community needs to join hands, translate consensus into action, resolutely defend multilateralism and work together to build a community of human destiny.
Guangzhou, September 30 (reporter Soo Youwei) Guangdong's first national standard 4K demonstration district was unveiled on September 30 in Jianzhen Garden District, Haizhu District, Guangzhou. On the same day, the 4K business of the Guangdong Radio and Television Network in the province was officially launched, and the opening ceremony of the 4K ultra-high-definition channel of the Central Radio and Television Station in Guangdong Province was held simultaneously.
The day's event was jointly organized by Guangdong Cable Radio and Television Network Co. Ltd. and the Leading Group on Joint Construction and Shared Social Governance in Datang District, Haizhu District.
According to the deployment of the provincial government of the Guangdong Provincial Committee, the Guangdong Radio and Television Network has actively implemented the new digital home 4K action plan. In December 2017, it released the first new digital home gateway terminal product in the country to support IPv6 and the first new digital home gateway terminal product in the country to support the four-way real 4K concurrency, the "U-point home server" (4K box with AVS2 standards and the voice remote control), and accelerated the construction of a new digital home demonstration area marked by 4K ultra-high-definition video, the next generation of the Internet and the application of cable wireless fusion network, and actively participated in the construction of the 4K television network in Guangdong Province.
In 2018, the Guangdong Radio and Television Network launched a series of radio and television initiatives to benefit the people, and launched the "Radio and Television 4K Service Month" to fully promote the "U-point home server" throughout the province.
On the day of the event, the 4K business of the Guangdong Radio and Television Network was officially launched in the province, and the first 4K Wisdom Television Safe Home Sharing Platform project, based on 4K applications, was also officially unveiled and put on the line. The platform was jointly built by Guangdong Cable and the Office of the Leading Group on Co-Construction and Sharing Social Governance in Datang District, Haizhu District. The platform project relies on the 4K ultra-clear U-point home server of the Guangdong Radio and Television Network to realize a new generation of intelligent family services based on the cable television network, integrate the relevant government service functions for the benefit of the people and the benefit of the people, and aims to provide an integrated television sharing platform for the public.
Chen Xiaorui, chief engineer of the Guangdong Provincial Bureau of Press, Publication, Radio and Television, said at the event that the event was a useful cooperation for radio and television network enterprises to take the initiative to serve the work of the government center of the Party Committee. The government actively used the "Internet +" to create a "digital government" to serve the people. He hoped that through cooperation and promotion, the Guangdong Radio and Television Network would help Haizhu District, Guangzhou and even the province to create a model of joint construction and shared social governance.
The ceremony on-site display and popularization of 4K smart TV safe home sharing platform, with 4K TV as the core of the new digital home application.
For the first time, the "4K Wisdom TV Safe Home Sharing Platform" will have four modules: "Guangzhou Neighbourhood", "New Guangzhou People's Home", "Wisdom Community" and "Wisdom Family" on the line, focusing on exploring the construction of Wisdom District.
It is reported that the Guangdong Radio and Television Network has now opened five sets of 4K live channels, and on the day of the National Day, the province will also open an exclusive 4K ultra-high-definition channel on the central radio and television station.
The report reads as follows: September 30, the country's 5th Martyrs' Day.
At 10 a.m., Xi Jinping and other party and state leaders, together with representatives from all walks of life in the capital, attended a ceremony to present flower baskets to the people's heroes in memory of the heroes and martyrs.
To this CCTV issued a quick comment: This is the first martyr's anniversary after the implementation of the Law on the Protection of Hero Martyrs in China.
Five years ago, the establishment of the Martyrs' Day on the eve of the National Day showed the great journey of the Chinese nation from suffering to glory. We should always be alert: "Where do we come from, where do we go".
General Secretary Xi Jinping deeply pointed out that "abandoning tradition and losing it is tantamount to cutting off his spiritual lifeblood".
"Don't forget history to open up the future."
We advocate heroes and commemorate martyrs, is to always remember history, continue the strong spirit, and unite the strong positive energy of national rejuvenation.
The quick review pointed out that the British martyrs are the backbone of the nation.
To honor the martyrs and pay tribute to the martyrs is to make the martyrs a noble, holy and powerful eternal memory in our hearts.
According to incomplete statistics, about 20 million martyrs died valiantly for national independence, people's liberation, the prosperity and strength of the country and the well-being of the people.
Every martyr who died for his country will be remembered, and every spirit of loyalty to the country will be looked up.
It is in order to pay tribute to them in the name of the country, deeply remember their great achievements, and learn to pass on their valuable spirit of love for the motherland, loyalty to the people, selfless dedication and courage to sacrifice.
Party committees and governments at all levels have improved the system of pension and preferential treatment and continuously raised the level of pension treatment, and the Party and the state have practiced their respect for heroes with practical actions.
Every year, countless people pay tribute to the martyrs' mausoleum, so that we can experience the deep feelings remembered by the masses and feel the momentum of rejuvenation rising in the blood of the nation.
Advocating heroes, defending heroes, learning heroes and caring for heroes have become popular in the whole society.
At the end of the quick review, it is pointed out that, at a time when socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era, we can comfort the martyrs who have been sleeping underground: a strong China is rising in the east, and the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is becoming a reality in our hands.
Let us with the strong spirit to sharpen the forward strength, towards the great goal!

The 5th "Disability Voice Month" arrives to pay attention to sex education for young people with disabilities-China New Network
In recent years, the topic of sex education for young people in China has been widely discussed, but the challenge of sex education for young people with disabilities is still very difficult.
Recently, a seminar on the challenges and practical strategies of comprehensive education for people with disabilities was held in Beijing.
How to carry out sex education for children and young people with disabilities has become an important topic of this seminar.
The Report on Sexual Knowledge, Attitudes and Behavior of Children and Young People with Disabilities in China, released at the meeting, showed that the proportion of children with disabilities suffering from sexual harassment and sexual abuse was higher than that of healthy children.
For children and young people with disabilities, more attention is paid to "sexual protection" in the society.
The purpose of the seminar is to explore the promotion of comprehensive sexuality education for children and young people with disabilities in China from three aspects: family support, school education and institutional services, and to provide support to children and young people with disabilities at the source, so that they, like others, have the right to enjoy love at home.
Experts believe that for a long time, the public's understanding of disabled groups in Chinese society has remained at a level that is not deep enough.
Affected by traditional ideas and other factors, China's comprehensive education for people with disabilities, especially children and young people with disabilities, is not in-depth enough.
However, in recent years, with the support of UNESCO and public welfare people, the practice and realization path of sexual and reproductive health education for people with disabilities in China have developed in an all-round way.
According to the Report, children and young people with visual, hearing, intellectual and physical disabilities, although they may have more difficulties in obtaining sexual knowledge and understanding intimate relationships than the general population, have generally developed towards convenience and richness.
Organised by the Shanghai Foundation for the Public Interest and jointly supported by the UNESCO representative office in China, the Beijing representative office of the International Union for the Disabled (France) and the representative office of the United Nations Population Fund in China, the "Seminar on Challenges and Practical Strategies for Comprehensive Sex Education for People with Disabilities" aims to jointly explore the practice and realization path of sexual and reproductive health education for people with disabilities in the context of the Great Strategy for a Healthy China, promote policy makers, educators, researchers, social service organizations, parents' representatives and other stakeholders in the field of special education and integrated education to understand the challenges of comprehensive sexuality education and the right to health of children and young people with disabilities in the future, and to develop a blueprint for the development of comprehensive sexuality education for children and young people with disabilities in China.
BEIJING, Sept 30 (Reuters) -China's central bank on Sunday released net data on scheduled short-term outflows of foreign currency assets, showing that the central bank's short position in foreign currency against local currency forward and futures contracts was zero for 12 consecutive months at the end of August and still had no long positions in the month.
The central bank's previous data showed that at the end of August last year, the central bank held US $6.044 billion in short positions in foreign currency against local currency forward and futures contracts, the 4th consecutive month unchanged, while short positions in SDR (special drawing rights) were 4.276 billion SDR.
Since then, the central bank's foreign exchange forward short position has been zero.
The central bank first released the data at the end of March 2016; the data showed the central bank's foreign currency-to-local currency forward and futures contract long positions of US $2.438 billion and short positions of US $28.9 billion at the end of February 2016.
For the first time, the September data, released at the end of October of the same year, showed a net increase of US $16.401 billion to US $45.301 billion.
The central bank has previously said that the forward and futures short positions of foreign currency against the local currency mainly reflect the foreign exchange forward operations carried out by the central bank with commercial banks to meet the hedging needs of enterprises' foreign currency liabilities, and will continue to provide long-term safe-haven products in accordance with the principle of real demand, and that the central bank's forward operations will have less impact on the size of future foreign exchange reserves.
On the night of September 20 this year, on the K158 train, Qiao, who was a junior in Zhengzhou, took a bus to Hebi.
A master on the train bought a seat-free ticket, but took her seat: "Take a pat".
After a two-hour drive, the conductor advised him that an hour was still invalid.
In the end, a male passenger in the same car could not see down to pull the master up.
From the point of view of public opinion, although most of the final results are that the bully is condemned by the public, punished by the public security department, and even blacklisted for integrity, the public still feels that he does not "relieve his hatred ": why can't the bully be punished on the spot?
Why not stop their immoral or even illegal acts on the spot, but punish them afterwards?
And for the unreasonable behavior of the "bully", how is it just a male passenger "see the road uneven" and pull it up?
The main reason for this is that only long-distance trains are equipped with police, and short-haul trains are generally not available; even if there are police officers, the police are more concerned about the possible rogue response of the bully and do not take compulsory removal measures.
Repeated incidents of bullying have made people realize that the bully must be forcibly taken away or even punished on the spot in order to act as a deterrent.
This requires that our train police officers should dare to take strong measures in a timely manner, and that trains that do not have police officers should be equipped with police officers as soon as possible in order to preserve the timely suppression and suppression of illegal acts.
On October 1, the first day of the National Day holiday, vehicles surged in the direction of Songpan, Mao County, via Beichuan Qiang Autonomous County, Sichuan Province.
At about 1300 hours, Beichuan traffic police received a call for help, saying that his family had a traffic accident in Songpan and was in urgent need of being sent to Mianyang for treatment because of limited local medical conditions.
Just as Beichuan Tangjiashan Yan Sehu Ring Lake Road to implement one-way traffic control, want to ask the traffic police to release the 120 first aid vehicle.
After receiving the call for help, the police on duty quickly reported the situation to the brigade. After a simple understanding of the situation, the captain, Huang Xuemin, immediately arranged for the police on duty at the control point to contact the helpers and asked for every effort to do a good job in the escort.
"At that time, there were more than a thousand vehicles entering the controlled section of the road. After contact with 120 first aid vehicles, it is expected that the arrival time in Beichuan will be around 15:00. We will immediately arrange for deployment." he said.
Wei, head of the Yuli Squadron of Beichuan Traffic Police, said that the first aid vehicle needed to bypass the Tangjiashan Yan Sehu Ring Lake Road, and that the road was steep and narrow. In order to prevent the vehicles that had already entered the road from driving in double rows, the traffic police imposed piecemeal control on the vehicles at the beginning, middle and end of the road an hour in advance, and reminded all passing drivers to let the road on one side and make the wrong car for the first aid vehicle.
Subsequently, the drum squadron police also temporarily stopped vehicles from entering the control section, queuing for the upcoming 120 first aid vehicles.
At about 1500 hours, a Sichuan U-licensed ambulance drove into Beichuan, and Beichuan traffic police sent a police car to open the road to escort the first aid vehicle retrograde into the control section.
It is understood that some places around the lake road can only pass by one car, and the police have carried out temporary control of these places in advance, ensuring the smooth passage of 120 first aid vehicles.
When they arrived at the village of ten-mile monument in Huoping Township, there was a section of the road that could not be misallowed, so the traffic police contacted the two village committees in advance, borrowed the village road to bypass it and banned social vehicles from entering.
"It took only 40 minutes from the Beichuan traffic police to receive 120 first aid vehicles to drive into the normal road of 302 provincial roads." he said.
According to the normal situation, the whole passage time will take four hours, Wei said.
"This arrangement has successfully secured valuable treatment time for the patients."
It is reported that at 1720 hours, critically ill patients were sent to Mianyang in time for treatment.

In the car, two suspicious men, one left and one right, sandwiched the male passenger in the middle, one of whom tried to cover the other.
But they did not know that their every move had already fallen in the eyes of the plainclothes police who were watching.
"Catch the thief and catch the stolen goods", plainclothes police catch people to pay attention to the fire, in the process of waiting for the man to start the theft, the police stared intently at the man who was preparing to steal, just after they were caught by the investigators in one fell swoop.
The Beijing Morning News reporter saw that the police seized 800 yuan in cash from the theft suspect.
"They took the money from the passenger's clothes pocket."
Pointing to a broken coat pocket, the police said: "They cut it open and stole 800 yuan from a passenger who came to Beijing. When we caught them, the money had just been put in their own pockets."
The reporter learned that, in order to catch the two men, the plainclothes police followed for an hour, finally in their crime in one fell swoop.
The two suspects are currently being reviewed by police.
Plain-clothes police told reporters that who is suspicious in the crowd, the question is very simple for the police.
"When thieves catch more, they will find that their eyes and looks are different from those of ordinary passengers. In addition to staring at people's pockets and backpacks, they also like to drill into the crowd rather than hide from people." he said.
The police also told reporters that suspects and other cars often have no purpose, like to roam in the station, find the target of pickpockets before they will follow the car.
"These are all empirical talk, plain clothes have been doing more for a long time, naturally know."
In addition, the police also suggested that "the outer pocket is the most convenient and easy to be stolen."
During the ride, you should pay attention to your belongings in case of theft.

British Prime Minister Theresa May on Sunday called on her party to unite behind her Brexit plan, directly calling on critics to support it, saying the free trade deal they wanted was at the heart of her Brexit plan.
British Prime Minister Theresa May travels to attend the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, England, September 30, 2018.
At the start of the Conservative Party's feverish annual conference, Theresa May's plans were again attacked by two former cabinet ministers, including former Foreign Secretary Johnson, who called Theresa May's plans "deranged".
But she also received strong support from other pro-Brexit ministers who "praised Theresa May as one of the most polite people," with International Trade Secretary Fox and Foreign Secretary Hunter also pointing their anger at the EU.
Theresa May's already fragile leadership came under further pressure this month after the EU rejected parts of the so-called "Chex" plan.
But Theresa May viewed the consultations positively, saying she was prepared to consider EU doubts.
"My message to my own party is that let's work together to find the best deal for the UK," Theresa May said.
Former British Foreign Secretary Johnson called Theresa May's plans "deranged" and attacked her for having no confidence in Brexit.
He and former Brexit Secretary David Davis are pushing for a Canadian-style free trade deal with the EU.
Theresa May, for her part, said the proposal would allow Northern Ireland to implement different tariff rules, akin to Northern Ireland's secession from the UK.

This newspaper news (intern reporter Li Qiyao) in recent years, many places have occurred the campus plastic runway substandard incident.
To this end, the Ministry of Education issued a notice requiring the new national standard to be implemented at the surface-level sports venues for synthetic materials in primary and secondary schools that are delivered for use after 1 November this year.
The mandatory national standard, "Surface Sports Ground for Synthetic Materials in Primary and Secondary Schools", was led by the Ministry of Education and drafted with the participation of 26 scientific research institutes and testing institutions. After more than two years of revision, more than 100 expert meetings were organized during the period, as well as field visits and sample inspections throughout the country, and countless verification experiments of the products of hundreds of enterprises on the market were collected.
In contrast to the old national standard in 2005, the reporter found that the new national standard not only changed from the "National Recommended Standard" to the "National Compulsory Standard", but also added a lot of content, including thickness requirements, physical properties, aging resistance, inorganic packing content requirements, anti-skid rubber polymer content requirements, limit of harmful substances for finished products on the surface layer, and limit of harmful substances for non-solid and solid raw materials.
In particular, it is worth mentioning that the new national standard limits the number of harmful substances that may be produced in the construction of plastic runways on campus, from 7 to 18, and sets out the limit of volatile organic matter on the completed runway in accordance with the home furnishings standards.
For example, the release of harmful substances is clearly stipulated in the Limits and Odour Requirements for Hazardous Substances in Cast-in-situ and Prefabricated Surface Products, requiring that total volatile organic compounds should not be higher than 5 mg / m3, formaldehyde should not be higher than 0.4 mg / m3, carbon disulfide should not be higher than 7 mg / m3, benzene should not be higher than 0.1 mg / m3 and the odour level should not be higher than 3.
The new national standard also makes detailed provisions on the sampling requirements, inspection rules and determination rules of plastic runways in primary and secondary schools.
In addition, the campus artificial lawn is also included in the scope of compulsory testing of the national standard for the first time.
In the near future, all localities will carry out special work arrangements on the implementation of the new national standard, and report the implementation of the new national standard to the Department of Physical Health and Arts Education of the Ministry of Education during the year.

Activating rural consumption, we should rely on the normal mechanism to purify the market, guide the demand for healthy consumption, and enhance the sense of farmers' consumption.
According to the data, the consumption potential of rural residents continued to be released, with retail sales of rural consumer goods up 10.5% in the first half of this year, 1.3%age points higher than in cities and towns.
During a visit to a poverty-stricken village in a western county, there was only one convenience store in the village. Walking into the store, some goods were familiar. "Golden Dragon Fish" was marked "Golden Dragon Oil", "Wangzi" became "Wangmilk" and "shanzhai" commodities were many.
Over the years, similar phenomena have been frequently exposed, some rural fake and inferior commodities near famous brands, similar names, similar packaging, false, it is too much to prevent.
According to a consumer survey released by a western city, the problem of super-counterfeit goods in rural areas is serious, with 66% of users buying counterfeit goods in supermarkets under the township line, with food accounting for more than half.
The relevant departments to improve the rural market, year after year, why is "Li Ge" still repeatedly beaten?
Unlike the urban market, farmers' awareness of rights protection is relatively weak, and many rural areas are remote and in blind areas beyond the reach of regulatory forces, so that fake and inferior commodities have a breeding ground.
A commodity multi-head management, some departments in charge of prices, some in charge of production, some in charge of the market, cross-cutting functions, year-on-year counterfeiting, centralized management of a gust of wind, fake goods escaped the spotlight, and slowly emerged, just after the old holiday, new holidays came out again.
The lack of a long-term regulatory mechanism, the difficulty of purifying the rural market, the low cost of breaking the law and the large benefits have led some illegal traders to use the crooked mind of "going to the mountains and going to the countryside", and some rural areas have become "waste elimination markets".
From food and clothing to well-off, the vast majority of farmers are moving towards development-oriented consumption.
A few days ago, the Central Committee of the Party and the State Council issued the Opinions on Improving the Institutional Mechanism for Promoting Consumption and Further Stimulating the Consumption Potential of Residents, which proposed to promote the upgrading of the consumption of rural residents, with the aim of enabling farmers to "consume", "willing to consume" and "dare to consume", so that rural consumption can truly flourish.
On the one hand, we should deepen reform, eliminate the shortcomings of market supervision and multi-pronged management, improve the network of food safety and product quality supervision according to local conditions, and continuously reduce the space for counterfeiting and selling in rural areas.
On the other hand, we should strengthen law enforcement, open up the supervision of "capillaries", and never allow fake and inferior products to breed and spread in rural areas.
Severe punishment of potholes is the protection of farmers. No matter how hidden the counterfeiters are, they should not be a reason for the breeding of fake and inferior commodities. The relevant departments should clarify their responsibilities, the grass-roots supervision forces should sink, and which link goes wrong, they should be investigated for responsibility, so that the counterfeiters and counterfeiters have no place to hide.
We will strictly close market access, carry out strict qualification examination for producers and operators, check the circulation of the market, let the products come to the right road, clear the road, find ways from the source and root, so that the legal dealers can operate at ease and let the farmers buy at ease.
Activating rural consumption, we should guide the demand for healthy consumption.
With the upgrading of consumption, many farmers not only seek to eat enough and eat well, but also pursue high-quality life such as culture and health, and cannot equate the rural market with "low-quality" and "cheap" paintings.
This requires promoting the extension of e-commerce to the vast rural areas, unblocking the two-way linkage sales channels between urban and rural areas, promoting the integration of the offline industrial development platform and the online electric business trading platform, and supporting the expansion of the new mode of consumption to the rural market; promoting the organic integration of trade and logistics with leisure agriculture, rural tourism and product processing in towns and villages with conditions; and improving the modern rural circulation network system, optimizing the integration of stock facilities and resources, and effectively reducing the cost of rural circulation.
To create a clear and secure market environment for the countryside, so that farmers' consumption is not worried, rural consumption can become more and more prosperous, so as to enhance the sense of acquisition and happiness of farmers' consumption.
From November 1, China will reduce the most-favoured-nation tax rate on some goods, and the total tariff level will be reduced to 7.5%
In accordance with the decision of the 26th executive meeting of the State Council, the Committee on Tariffs and Tariffs of the State Council issued a notice on the 30th to reduce the most-favoured-nation tax rate for some commodities from November 1, 2018.
In accordance with the Notice of the Committee on Tariffs and Tariffs of the State Council on the Reduction of Import Tariffs on Some Commodities, in order to meet the needs of industrial upgrading, reduce the cost of enterprises and meet the multi-level consumption of the masses, the most-favoured-nation tax rate on some industrial goods and other commodities will be reduced from November 1 this year.
There are 1,585 tax items, accounting for about 19% of the total number of tax items in China, and the average tax rate has been reduced from 10.5% to 7.8%, an average decline of 26%.
The tax reduction mainly covers textiles; stone, ceramics and glass products; some steel and base metal products; electromechanical equipment and parts, such as metal processing machinery, textile machinery, engineering machinery, transmission and transmission equipment, electrical equipment, instruments and instruments; and resource-based commodities and primary processed products, such as non-metallic mines, inorganic chemicals, wood and paper products, and precious jade.
At the same time, with the reduction of the overall tariff level, especially the import tariff on medicines and consumer goods for daily use, the tariff rate of the import tax on imported goods will be reduced accordingly.
In order to implement the decision-making and deployment of the Central Committee of the Party and the State Council, China has imposed zero tariffs on the vast majority of imported drugs since May 1 this year, reduced import tariffs on automobiles, parts and components and some consumer goods for daily use since July 1, and implemented the third step of tax reduction on products expanded by the information technology agreement.

An appropriate reduction in tariffs is conducive to promoting the balanced development of foreign trade, promoting a higher level of opening-up to the outside world, as well as making overall use of both international and domestic resources and promoting domestic supply-side structural reform.
The relevant person in charge of the committee said that this year marks the 40th anniversary of reform and opening-up, and that the initiative to reduce the overall tariff level is a practical action to implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the Boao Forum for Asia. It is also an important step for China to further expand its opening-up and actively expand its imports in accordance with its own high-quality development needs. This action and initiative shows that China will unswervingly pursue a mutually beneficial and win-win opening-up strategy and, while enhancing its own development momentum, make China's development better benefit the world.

Red Army millet, black beans, mountain children pastoral black goats, hardcover bitter buckwheat tea, paper-cutting shadow books, pure hand-made slippers... pieces of beautifully packaged agricultural products are neatly placed on the exhibition stand, and they have a common brand name called "Huanxiang People".
"Building a regional brand of 'Ring Township People' has effectively solved the bottleneck of the development of'many and scattered, small and weak 'agricultural products in Huanxian County, and has become a powerful carrier for poverty alleviation." said the regional public brand conference of "Ring Township People" agricultural products hosted by Huanxian County, Gansu Province, held in Nankai District, Tianjin, on the 29th.
Huanxian is located at the junction of the three provinces and regions of Shaanxi-Gansing. As an "advanced county for grain production in the country", "the land of small grain in China" and "the land of shadow in China", it has a long history and is rich in resources.
Lamb meat, yellow rice wine, buckwheat chopped noodles, swallows noodles soft and other local snacks are often remembered by travellers in other countries.
With the continuous improvement of the level of urbanization in China, the urban population has increased rapidly, and a large number of rural young people have left their hometown to begin urban life.
Yang Qiaojia, an expert in agricultural brand research in China, said: "Now the pace of urban life is fast and the pressure is high, and more and more people are beginning to miss the rural life when they were young. However, 'those who can't go back are called their hometown, and the most beautiful memory is the countryside ', and the brand design of the'people around the countryside' is named after the homesickness and homesickness of the people who are adrift in the county."
Huanxian special climate conditions, long sunshine time, large temperature difference between day and night, special small grain planting conditions.
China is rich in more than 20 small grains, is the land of small grains in China, the yield is the highest in Gansu Province, the quality is among the highest in the country.

"The people in her hometown are the closest and the taste of her hometown is the most beautiful," she said. "The brand of 'Huanxiang People' has evoked too many of our homesickness, memories and memories of the food there. I hope the brand of 'Huanxiang People' will go further and further and bigger."
Dr. Tan Bin, a researcher at the Institute of Science of the State Food and Material Reserve Bureau, said that through the testing of more than 900 sets of index data, the test data of agricultural products such as buckwheat, bitter buckwheat and black beans in Huanxian County have outstanding advantages, and the content of many physiological active substances in miscellaneous grain is higher than the standard data, and the "Huanxiang people" have the inherent advantage of seizing the high-end grain market in China.
Chai Chun, secretary of the county committee of Huanxian County, said that through the release of the "Huanxiang People" brand, it will further improve the level of quality, standardization and large-scale innovation and development of high-quality agricultural products in Huanxian County, help to shape the good overall image of agricultural products in Huanxian County, and quickly enhance visibility, competitiveness and value added.
Canada's gross domestic product rose 0.2% in July from the previous month, a higher-than-expected increase, raising expectations that the Bank of Canada will raise interest rates next month.
If it does, it would be the central bank's 5th rate hike in a little more than a year.
Analysts interviewed by Reuters had previously forecast a 0.1% increase.
Statistics Canada said on Friday that 12 of the 20 sectors saw growth.
The data is notable because the central bank predicted earlier this month that temporary factors could drag down third-quarter GDP data.
Bank of Canada President Poloz promised Thursday that the central bank would continue to raise interest rates gradually and would keep a close eye on economic data.
The Bank of Canada's next interest rate decision will be on October 24.
The Bank of Canada has raised interest rates four times since July 2017 as the Canadian economy strengthens and unemployment is close to a record low.
Stephen Brown, a senior Canadian economist at CIC Macro, said the country's economy is expected to grow at an annual rate of about 2% in the third quarter.
"This will be higher than the 1.5% expected by the Bank of Canada and will therefore be another reason to expect the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates next month," he said in a note.
Overnight index swaps showed that the market's estimate of the Bank of Canada's chances of raising interest rates in October rose to 78.27% from 76.46%.
South Korea and North Korea's first joint visit to the mouth of the Han River in 65 years
South Korea's Defense Ministry confirmed on Friday that the two Koreas launched a joint visit to the waters at the mouth of the Han and Linjin rivers on the same day.
The initiative is a pre-preparation to ensure the free navigation of civilian vessels on both sides.
A briefing provided to the media by the South Korean Defense Ministry on the same day showed that it was the first time the two sides had conducted a joint visit to the mouth of the Han River since the signing of the Korean War armistice agreement in 1953.
South Korea and North Korea signed a military agreement in September, agreeing to jointly visit waters such as the mouth of the Han River into the sea from November to ensure future environmental protection and tourism development of the waters.
In October, the two Koreas planned a joint survey of the waters at a general-level meeting.
On November 5, a joint survey of Korean-Korean waters was officially launched.
The joint delegation was composed of 20 people, including the Korean and Korean military and experts.
During the visit, neither side carried weapons and banned the use of words and deeds that stimulated each other, according to South Korea's Defense Ministry.
"Because there is no military demarcation line near the mouth of the sea, the area was once an accident-prone area, but through joint visits, it will become a new peaceful area in the future." he said.
The waters jointly visited by the two Koreas are about 70 kilometers long and have a total area of about 280 square kilometers.
South Korea's Defense Ministry said the South Korean side will send six research vessels to detect the depth of the sea to provide basic information for the safe navigation of the waters, and will provide navigation maps for the movement of civilian ships when the investigation is completed.
The two Koreas held summit talks in Pyongyang in October 2007 to reach an agreement on the joint use of the Han and Linjin rivers into the sea, but follow-up talks were stalled by tensions on the peninsula.
Under a military agreement signed by South Korea and North Korea in September, future ships from both sides will need to inform each other in advance before sailing in common waters.
Chinese citizens Guo Yuqin and Mao Runxin lost contact during a trip to Mongolia, the website of the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia said on Thursday.
It is understood that the two were members of the Blue Sky Rescue Team. On October 19, the two contacted friends and relatives in the country and said they were about to explore the mountains near Lake Kusugur and shared their location through a microblog. They have since lost contact and are suspected to have gone to no man's land.
The Chinese Embassy in Mongolia has always attached great importance to the protection of the legitimate rights, interests and security of Chinese citizens in Mongolia, as well as to consular protection and assistance.
After learning of the loss of the above-mentioned two tourists, the Embassy immediately launched an emergency plan for receiving insurance, striving to seize the golden rescue time and make every effort to carry out its work.
The Embassy maintained close communication with the families of the parties concerned, assisted the family in immediately reporting the case to the Mongolian police, and provided the family with a list of translators for choice.
At the first time, the Embassy met with the heads of the Ministry of Foreign Relations, the General Administration of Police and the General Administration of Emergency Situations of Mongolia to inform them of the relevant situation, and asked the Mongolian side to carry out search and rescue as soon as possible, and to maintain close communication with the Mongolian side throughout the search and rescue process to ensure that the latest progress is kept in a timely manner.
At the same time, the Embassy has assisted the families in issuing search notices in Mongolia, and has widely mobilized overseas Chinese and Chinese enterprises in Mongolia to take an active part in the search for people, provide effective clues, and provide relevant assistance to a number of blue sky rescue workers who have gone to Mongolia to assist in the rescue.
Under the strong impetus of the embassy, the Mongolian side sent a rescue team at the first time and promised to waive search and rescue fees.
The General Directorate of the Mongolian Police and the General Directorate of Emergency Situations instructed the police and emergency departments of Kusugur Province to make every effort to search and rescue.
As Lake Kusugur is located on the border between northern Mongolia and Russia, is remote, sparsely populated, transportation and communications are extremely difficult, and Mongolia has now entered a severe winter, with temperatures as low as about minus 20 degrees, the local police and emergency departments have overcome great difficulties, mobilized almost all the police force and mobilized local herdsmen to carry out a wide range of carpet search and rescue operations around the two men's lost location for days through horse riding, walking and visiting herdsmen.
At the same time, in view of the special situation in the pastoral areas, the Mongolian side has been issuing search notices through the broadcast cycle for many days.
The relevant staff of the domestic Blue Sky Rescue Team have also come to Mongolia to actively participate in the rescue with the Mongolian side.
The safety of the two lost personnel has always touched our hearts.
It has been more than 10 days since the two men were lost, and the Embassy has received some clues, but the two have not yet been found, and search and rescue operations are still under intense strain.
The Embassy will always pay continuous attention to the matter on the basis of the principle of "people-oriented", push the Mongolian side to continue its full search and rescue efforts and provide maximum assistance to the families of the parties concerned.
The Embassy calls on compatriots and enterprises in Mongolia to contact the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia at the first time if they are informed of relevant clues.
