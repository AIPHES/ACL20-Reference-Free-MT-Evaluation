According to British media, the US Deputy Secretary of Naval Operations, Admiral William Moran, said that even as the US Navy is reinvigorating its efforts to deal with an increasingly worrying Russia on both sides of the Atlantic, the US continues to focus on the Asia-Pacific region, which the Pentagon has expanded to include the Indian Ocean-Asia-Pacific.
The United States listed China and Russia as strategic rivals in a new defense strategy announced at the beginning of the year, the website of Jane's Defence Weekly reported on Sept. 24
The US Navy has since restored the Second Fleet in order to more directly counter Russian activity.
The moves have raised some questions and concerns among allies and analysts, who worry that the U.S. Navy could move away from the "Asia-Pacific rebalancing" strategy that marked the Obama administration, the report said.
But Admiral Moran said the focus of the U.S. Navy remains on the western Pacific.
"For us, there has been no significant change," he said at a round-table discussion entitled "Addressing the High Seas Challenge," hosted by the US National Bureau of Asian Studies in Washington on January 24, 2018.
"The focus is still on rebalancing, shifting the center of gravity or whatever you want to describe it," Moran said.
He admitted, however, that the United States has a close relationship with Europe.
"We will continue to focus on growth on the West Coast and balance what we can do," he said.
While Moran pointed out that the overall policy on Russia falls within the purview of the US Secretary of Defense, he warned: "The Russians may face demographic and economic challenges, but history has shown that if we clash with them, they will be very tough."
Admiral Moran said the U.S. Navy was dynamically deploying troops into a "new mode of operations" as part of a resurgent U.S. campaign against Russia, China and other competitors, which would help catch adversaries off guard about where U.S. aircraft carrier battle groups or other assets would be deployed at any given time and place.
"We in the Navy and the Marine Corps support it - the concept of operational unpredictability, not to be in the same place again and again, almost like a clockwork - which is our approach," he said.
The first attempt at such a new approach was the Harry Truman aircraft carrier battle group, whose early deployment included working visits to ports and patrols in areas that normally pass only, the report said.
Moran said the U.S. Navy is now working to ensure allies know that the warships will still patrol traditional areas, and is also addressing logistical and family liaison issues for the new deployment process.
Lieutenant General Michael Noonan, commander of the Royal Australian Navy, also spoke at the event, saying the Australian army could work seamlessly with the US aircraft carrier battle group.
The situation will continue as the Royal Australian Navy plans to procure nine more frigates equipped with Cosmic Shield combat systems, he said.
Since October 5, a number of airlines have raised or restored the fuel surcharge and will have to pay more for air travel next Friday
Yesterday, Xiangpeng Airlines, Oke Airlines and other airlines announced that, with effect from October 5, 2018 (the date of issue), the domestic route fuel surcharge of 800 km (including) will be charged a fuel surcharge of 20 yuan per passenger and a fuel surcharge of 30 yuan per passenger on more than 800 km of routes.
Xiangpeng Airlines, Oke Airlines and other companies have announced that, with effect from zero (the date of issue) on October 5, 2018, the standard for charging fuel surcharges on domestic routes of less than 800 km (including) has increased from 10 yuan / person to 20 yuan / person, and the standard for charging fuel surcharges on domestic routes of more than 800 km has increased from 10 yuan / person to 30 yuan / person per passenger.
The disability of children and military police is 10 yuan / person; the baby continues to be exempted.
According to the person in charge of the Ctrip ticket, the airline has indicated in the notice that the charge of the fuel surcharge is based on the original date of issue, and that the fuel surcharge will not be paid back when the passenger ticket is changed.
This means that domestic route tickets issued before October 5 do not have to pay a fuel surcharge in accordance with the new standard if they are to be changed to or after October 5.
Since June 5, 2018, a number of airlines, including Air China, Eastern Airlines, Air China, Shanghai Airlines, Spring and Autumn Airlines, Shenzhen Airlines, Western Airlines and Oke Airlines, have resumed the collection of fuel surcharges on domestic routes that have been cancelled for three years, with a standard of 10 yuan per person.
This time, Xiangpeng Airlines and Okei Airlines took the lead in announcing an increase in the fuel surcharge. As of the press release, they had not seen the announcement of the follow-up adjustment by the country's four major airlines.
It is also understood that the Hong Kong Civil Aviation Department has stipulated that airlines can decide on their own whether to charge a fuel surcharge from November.
Cathay Pacific first announced on September 27 that it would lift the fuel surcharge on November 2.
According to the Cathay Pacific website, all tickets issued or re-issued by Cathay Pacific and Cathay Pacific Dragon Airlines on or after November 2 will include a fuel surcharge of $652 for long-distance flights to and from Hong Kong and the South-West Pacific, North America, Europe, the Middle East and India, and Africa, and $146 for short-haul flights.
The fee applies to all ticket types, based on each segment, and includes airfare quotes from all direct selling channels in Cathay Pacific.
On the eve of the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang met with the new envoys of 29 countries and regions to China in the afternoon in the Great Hall of the People.
Li Keqiang shook hands and had a cordial conversation with the envoys to China.

State Councilor and Minister for Foreign Affairs Wang Yi attended the event.
Fujizhong, Japan, on Friday recognized an impairment loss of $1.3 billion in its investment in Citic shares in China, writing down its largest corporate investment deal as a result of trade tensions between China and the United States.
In May 2016, a man walked past the headquarters of Maruhong Corporation in Tokyo, Japan.
Maruhong, for his part, said the trade war had hit its US grain division, Gao Hong, and had suspended financial transactions in agriculture.
Some Japanese heavy equipment manufacturers, telecoms companies, etc., have warned about the impact of trade friction between China and the United States when they released their latest results, and now these Japanese traders have joined the ranks.
The US and China have imposed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of each other's goods, and US President Donald Trump has threatened to extend the tax to all more than $500 billion of Chinese goods to the US if the dispute is not resolved.
The impact of the trade dispute on China's economy is likely to be greater next year, according to Tsuyoshi Hachimura, chief financial officer of Fujizhong Commercial.
Fujizhong Commercial and Thai Beebee Group invested $10 billion in Citic in 2015, taking a 20 per cent stake in it.
Mr. Hachimura said Fujizhong had lost 143.3 billion yen ($1.3 billion) to the stake, arguing that Citic's share price would not recover in the near future.
Fujizhong maintained its profit forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019 at 500 billion yen.
In July, China imposed an additional 25 per cent import tariff on US soybeans in response to Washington's moves in trade friction.
"Our grain business has been hit by trade friction between the US and China," said Yenhong, Maruhong's finance minister.
Mr Gao has stopped financial transactions in his own account since September, he said.
Gao Hong spokesman Pat Burke said in a statement Friday that the company's move was "limited in accordance with internal policy and due to a lack of market opportunities."
He also said the suspension of financial transactions would not lead to fewer jobs.
Maruhong maintains an annual profit estimate of 230 billion yen, which is helped by the pulp and paper and power generation business.
Sumitomo Commercial on Thursday reported a 16 per cent increase in profits between April and September, stressing that "trade problems between the United States and China have led to an uncertain outlook."
Mitsubishi raised its annual profit forecast to a record level on Friday, owing to increased production of coking coal and higher prices for commodities such as oil and coal.
Mitsubishi also announced a new business plan to increase its profit in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022 to 900 billion yen ($7.98 billion), up from an estimated 640 billion yen this year.
On November 5, the China New Network reported that the vote in the US mid-term election has entered the countdown.
On November 4, President Donald Trump and his Democratic opponents actively "called for votes" to their core voters.
Both parties have pointed out that voter turnout will be the key to the left-right vote.
In the 48 hours before the popular vote in the United States, Trump was reportedly busy attending the rally of Republican candidates, and former President Barack Obama went to Indiana to stand on the platform of Joe Donnelly, the embattled Democratic federal Senate candidate, and to shout out his final pre-election appeal to the crowd.
On November 4, Trump went to the platform for Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp in Megan, Georgia, and said, "You have to go to the polling station on Tuesday, you have to vote."
"The contrast in this election could not have been clearer."
The political enthusiasm of voters has risen to a rare peak, and early voting in some states has gone far beyond usual.
Successive US presidents face the first midterm elections, and the number of seats in Congress for his party tends to decline.
While the Democratic vote for the federal House of Representatives remains dominant, Republicans can benefit from an economic assessment and Trump's tight focus on border security, according to new polls released by the Washington Post and ABC News on Thursday.
Polls show that registered voters prefer more Democratic House candidates than Republicans, at 50% to 43%, but there is still a decline from a 14-point lead in August.
Another poll by NBC and the Wall Street Journal also showed Democrats still seven points ahead of Republicans.
"When people don't tell the truth, when words no longer represent anything, there are bound to be consequences," Obama told the crowd on the occasion of Senator Donnelly's momentum.
When people can only lie on their own, democracy will not work. "
"The only way to stop the actions of these Republicans right now is you and your vote."
Democrats face the most difficult election in decades in the Senate, where Republicans now hold more than half of the 51 seats.
But the House of Representatives is more favorable, and Democrats need to win another 23 seats to take control of the 435-seat House of Representatives.
Analysts at FiveThirtyEight.com, a predictive selection website, estimate that Democrats are as likely to win the House of Representatives as 85%.

From September 29 to 30, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) convened Secretary-General Xi Jinping's important ideological and theoretical seminar on strengthening and improving the work of the CPPCC in Beijing.
Wang Yang pointed out that, since the 18th Party Congress, Secretary-General Xi Jinping has put forward a series of new ideas and new ideas on strengthening and improving the work of the CPPCC, put forward for the first time that the CPPCC is an important channel and specialized consultative body of socialist consultative democracy, an important part of the country's governance system, an institutional arrangement with Chinese characteristics, clarified for the first time the characteristics and advantages of the new political party system, emphasized the correct handling of the relationship between consistency and diversity, deeply revealed that the true meaning of the people's democracy lies in good consultation and consultation among the people, revealed the logical link between the "rule of China" and the Chinese political system, and condensed the deep theoretical thinking of adhering to the good and developing the CPPCC system, which is the latest result of the theory of the CPPCC.
Wang Yang stressed that the CPPCC at all levels should take the theoretical study and discussion as an opportunity to further find out the weak links and shortcomings in the work of the CPPCC, and work hard to strengthen and improve and make breakthroughs.
We should strengthen the construction of the CPPCC system in an all-round way, and ensure that the decisions and decisions of the CPC Central Committee are fully carried out in the work of the CPPCC.

In order to thoroughly study and implement the idea of socialism with Chinese characteristics in Xi's new era and the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Party, the CPPCC system began in May to carry out Secretary-General Xi Jinping's important ideological study and discussion activities on strengthening and improving the work of the CPPCC, and convened eight regional seminars and seven expert and academic seminars, which identified 18 key topics and six basic theoretical topics, with a total of 79,380,000 CPPCC members at all levels and 279,000 government cadres taking part in studies and discussions, resulting in more than 36,000 research papers.
Under the current wave of "mass entrepreneurship, mass innovation," more and more technology companies are beginning to pay attention to patent research and development and related protection work, dig deep into the potential value of patents and take the lead in the market.
Similarly, a number of science and technology enterprises have encountered a great deal of infringement in the authorization of patent technology and the use of patented technology.
At the end of 2017, three people from Guangdong Province, Tan Wei, He Zhanhong and Lai Bin, on the grounds of patent infringement, brought the developer of "drop travel" APP, Beijing Orange Technology Co., Ltd. (Hereinafter referred to as Orange Technology), operator Didi Travel Technology Co., Ltd. (Hereinafter referred to as Didi Travel) and seller Guangdong Pacific Internet Information Services Co., Ltd. (Hereinafter referred to as Guangdong Pacific) to the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The three plaintiffs requested the court to order that the three defendants immediately stop the manufacture, sale, promise of sale and use of the plaintiff's patent.
On October 30, 2018, the China Referees' Documents Network published "the first-instance civil decision in a dispute over infringement of patent rights, such as Tan Wei, He Zhanhong and Beijing Orange Science and Technology Co. Ltd.," revealing the details of some of the cases in which APP has been sued for patent infringement.
The three plaintiffs believe that the patentee and inventor of the patent for the "carpool service system and method based on the mobile terminal," and that the whole operation of the "windmill" application in the "drip trip" APP corresponds to the technical scheme of patent protection, which constitutes a patent infringement.
However, during the court ruling, Orange Technology held that the Guangdong Pacific was not a suitable defendant, that it had only provided free downloads of the APP "drip trip" on the Internet, that it had not implemented the patented method, that there had been no direct or indirect infringement, and that it should not be listed as a defendant in the case.
Second, the place of the infringement in this case is not in Guangdong.
In accordance with the provisions of the law, the place where the infringement of the patent in question should be the place where the patent method in question should be carried out in its entirety, the jurisdiction of the court was challenged and the case was transferred to the court of the defendant's place of residence, the Beijing Intellectual Property Court.
The Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court held that the defendant, Guangdong Pacific, had provided APP products on its Internet platform, and that it was not inappropriate for the plaintiff to list the defendant, Guangdong Pacific, as a defendant.
And the defendant's place of residence in the Guangdong Pacific is in the city of Guangzhou, which belongs to the jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The defendant Orange Science and Technology claimed that the case should be referred to the Beijing Intellectual Property Court for trial, on the basis of insufficient grounds, rejected the defendant Orange Science and Technology Co., Ltd.'s objection to the jurisdiction of the case, and borne the cost of accepting the case.
At present, the other proceedings in the case have not yet been announced, and journalists will also pay close attention to the follow-up details of the patent infringement case.
Interview with the Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Scientific and Industrial Research Organization of Australia: Significant achievements in science and technology cooperation between Australia and China
"China's science and technology has developed rapidly over the past few decades, and Australia and China can work hand in hand in the field of science and can achieve fruitful results."
In an interview with the China News Agency in Beijing, Larry Marshall, chief executive of the Federal Scientific and Industrial Research Organization of Australia, said Australia-China cooperation in the field of science and technology has shown great vitality, from the fight against climate change to cooperation on the "Sky Eye" project.
As the largest national scientific research institution in the Australian Federation, CSIRO has achieved a number of innovative research achievements that have attracted the attention of the world in the fields of oceans, energy, biology, materials and astronomy.
CSIRO has maintained close cooperation with scientific research institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
"It's a long-lasting friendship that embraces trust in partners and a tradition of long-term cooperation," Marshall said.
In May, China's 500-meter spherical radio telescope, the "China Sky Eye," installed the world's first 19-beam L-band receiver.
The current international state-of-the-art 19-beam feed-source receiver has been jointly developed by Chinese and Australian scientists.
Mr Marshall said the successful development of the receiver was based on years of technical accumulation by the CSIRO, which would increase the speed of the FAST survey by five to six times, and would expand more scientific observation targets.
"This is a force that CSIRO has contributed to the FAST," he said.
In addition to the above-mentioned cooperation, CSIRO also has close cooperation with Chinese scientific research institutions in the construction of square-kilometer array radio telescopes, the development of new fuel technologies, energy conservation and emission reduction.
"In the past, scientific research has tended to focus on the problems of the past hundred years, and more scientific research is needed to solve the problems ahead."
Marshall believes that Australia and China are complementary in the field of scientific development, and that both countries face a series of challenges in their development.
Extreme weather, for example, is frequent around the world, droughts and floods have led to reduced food production, and food shortages have seriously affected human development.
At the same time, the problems of population explosion, ageing and chronic diseases are also serious challenges.
"The cooperation between Australia and China in recent years has focused mainly on solving these current problems."
Marshall said that the International Centre for Marine Research in the Southern Hemisphere, co-founded by CSIRO and the Qingdao National Laboratory of Marine Science and Technology, focused on observing El Niño and La Niña, studying the relationship between the two and extreme weather, and establishing an early warning facility for extreme weather. A new variety of cereals to overcome extreme weather, developed jointly by CSIRO and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, could also alleviate food shortages caused by extreme weather.
"In the current environment, scientific and technological innovation is difficult to do on its own, it requires extremely high costs, and there are a lot of problems to be solved, so cooperation is especially important today."
Marshall said the closer the cooperation, the more likely it is to make a breakthrough, which is also the significance of closer cooperation between Australia and China within the framework of the "Belt and Road."
"Strengthening bilateral cooperation is mainly scientific and technological cooperation for us."
Marshall said, for example, that CSIRO has recently developed a gold purification method that does not use cyanide, because the traditional cyanide gold purification method is very harmful to the environment, and many countries hope to find a way to purify gold with little environmental pollution.
"We are willing to introduce this technology into China, which is one of the results of our participation in the Belt and Road cooperation," he said.
On September 29, the 2018 Baoji Silk Road Tourism Promotion and Project Cooperation Conference was held in Urumqi, Xinjiang. While appreciating the achievements of the development of Baoji, participants can also enjoy local cuisine and feel the heavy history and culture of the region.
In the month before the event, Baoji carried out a series of tourism publicity and promotion activities in eight cities along the Silk Road, including Tianshui, Pingliang, Lanzhou, Yinchuan, Guyuan, Xining, Zhangye and Hami, which laid a good foundation for the successful holding of the 2018 Baoji Silk Road Tourism Promotion and Project Cooperation Conference.
Hui Jincai, mayor of Baoji City, Shaanxi Province, said that Baoji has a long history and culture and a strong industrial base. It is the second largest city in Shaanxi Province, the deputy central city of the Guan Tien Economic Zone and the Guanzhong Plain City Group, and an important node city along the "Belt and Road" initiative.
In recent years, the city of Baoji has continued to enhance the five functions of industrial clusters, logistics hubs, integrated services, open highlands and human cohesion, so as to accelerate catch-up and transcendence and high-quality development.
At the meeting, the Baoji Tourism Development Committee and the Urumqi Tourist Board signed a strategic cooperation agreement on tourism between the two places.
At the same time, a number of travel agencies in Xinjiang have signed tourism cooperation agreements with Baoji Daishuchuan Tourism Scenic Area, Famen Temple Buddha Cultural Scenic Area, Taibaishan Tourism Scenic Area and Guanshan Prairie Scenic Area.
"In Da Mei Xinjiang, some tourism resources complement Baoji. We have come all the way to introduce tourism to Xinjiang, mainly to introduce humanistic Baoji, gourmet Baoji, natural scenery, etc., and select more than 500 photos to give customers a sense of the beautiful scenery of Baoji," said Chen Hongwei, head of the Market Promotion Section of the Baoji Tourism and Development Commission.
With emphasis on tourism resources, tourism projects and tourist routes, the event has comprehensively promoted and promoted the overall image of Baoji tourism, high-quality tourism products and high-quality tourism industry projects, consolidated the tourist source market in Xinjiang, fully sang the "look at China Baoji" brand, enhanced the influence and visibility of Baoji city in the northwest region, and attracted more tourists from Xinjiang to the Baoji tourism experience through the broadcasting of tourism posters, the promotion of
Feng Xu, deputy director of the Baoji Merchants and Merchants Bureau, said: "At this event, Baoji departments at all levels, counties, districts and development areas have actively docked and negotiated, and coordinated the implementation of a large number of good projects and large projects.
So far, a total of 41 signed projects have been implemented, involving a total amount of 26.043 billion yuan. "
In recent years, Baoji has continued to enhance the five functions of industrial clusters, logistics hubs, integrated services, open highlands and humanistic cohesion around the goal of building international cities along the "Belt and Road" initiative, famous cities in equipment manufacturing, famous historical and cultural cities, and beautiful and happy cities in liveable industries, so as to accelerate catch-up and high-quality development.
The regional gross domestic product reached 218 billion yuan in 2017, an increase of 8.7 per cent.
It has won more than 20 national honors, including the National Civilized City, the National Ecological Garden City and the China Habitat Environment Award.
Yan Nai Min, a member of the Standing Committee and Deputy Mayor of Urumqi City, said that Urumqi, as a major town on the New North Road on the Silk Road, has a special geographical location advantage. Since ancient times, it has been an important channel connecting the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, communicating Xinjiang with the mainland, connecting China with Central Asia, West Asia and Europe. It is an important window for China's opening to the west and economic and cultural exchanges with the outside world, and has a good investment environment.
The event focused on equipment manufacturing, logistics and commerce, tourism industry, with the sincere intention of complicity in the development of good opportunities and common business cooperation, made a great splash in Urumqi.
At the Conference, local businessmen in Xinjiang signed six projects with Baoji counties, involving a total amount of 3.25 billion yuan.
On the same day, representatives of Kyrgyzstan's visa office in Urumqi, the Russian Novosibirsk Law Co. Ltd., the Tajik Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Urumqi and the Russian Chamber of Commerce in Tatarstan attended the meeting.

Whether the vitality of the old industrial base can be re-energized and released, affecting the heart of the General Secretary.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued imposition of sanctions was deepening North Korea's distrust of the United States, and that North Korea could not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Ri Yong Ho said North Korea had taken a "very friendly approach" over the past year, including stopping missile and nuclear tests, dismantling nuclear test sites and committing to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we have not seen any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"If there is no confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and in such a situation, we cannot give up our weapons unilaterally."
While Ri Yong Ho is repeating North Korea's complaint that the United States is opposed to "phased" denuclearization, his speech is of great significance because there is no complete rejection of unilateral denuclearization, as North Korea has done before.
Lee referred to the joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Trump on June 12, when Kim agreed to North Korea's efforts to "denuclearize the Korean peninsula," and Trump pledged to protect North Korea's security.
North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says North Korea must give up its nuclear weapons first.
The United States has also refused to ease its demands for international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'denuclearization first' and increases pressure on sanctions to achieve its purpose in a high-handed manner, and even refuses to issue a 'declaration of the end of the war'," Li said.
"The idea that sanctions will allow us to kneel for mercy is that people who do not know us are daydreaming.
But the problem is that this continued sanctions are deepening our distrust. "
Lee did not mention the plan for the second special gold conference, which was mentioned by the US president at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, he highlighted three meetings between Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in over the past five months, saying: "If the other side of denuclearization is South Korea, not North Korea, then the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will not become so deadlocked."
China has announced that, with effect from November 1, 2018, it will reduce import tariffs for 1,585 tax purposes.
Since the beginning of this year, China has taken the initiative to reduce import tariffs.
On May 1 this year, the total tax on drugs was reduced, and import duties were adjusted to zero for a total of 28 tax purposes, including anti-cancer drugs and alkaloid drugs with anti-cancer effects, as well as Chinese medicines with actual imports.
At the same time, it has also greatly reduced the tax burden of value-added tax in the production and import of anti-cancer drugs.
On July 1, there was a tax reduction on 218 vehicles and spare parts for tax purposes.
After tax, the overall car tax rate in China is already lower than the average in developing countries, which is in line with the actual situation in the Chinese auto industry.
This tax reduction will promote the restructuring of the industry and the optimal allocation of resources, accelerate the survival of the winners and losers, help to improve the quality of products and services, and is expected to promote the adjustment of car prices to a certain extent, so as to bring more benefits to consumers.
On July 1, the tax on 1,449 daily consumer goods was reduced.
The reduction of taxes on daily consumer goods is closely related to the needs of the people for a better life.
The tax reduction is not only large but also strong, with an average tax reduction of 56 per cent.
The reduction of taxes on daily consumer goods will directly benefit the vast majority of consumers and promote the competitiveness of the domestic industry.
On November 1, a tax reduction will be imposed on 1,585 industrial products, such as mechanical and electrical equipment, spare parts and raw materials.
An appropriate reduction in import tariffs on some of the country's much-needed industrial goods will attract more foreign investment. It will help to increase effective domestic supply and contribute to industrial upgrading. It will also help enterprises allocate resources around the world, reduce production costs, and reduce the pressure on the domestic environment.
The person in charge of the Office of the Tariff Commission of the State Council said the four autonomous tax reductions, as well as the third step of the tax reduction implemented on July 1 in accordance with the outcome of the negotiations on the expansion of the scope of the information technology agreement, would reduce China's total tariff level to 7.5 per cent, down from 9.8 per cent the previous year.
The overall level of adjusted tariffs is slightly higher than that of the European Union, lower than that of most developing countries and at a moderately low level, which is basically in line with China's status as a developing country and the stage of development.
The person-in-charge said that the total level of tariffs, as one of the important indicators of the openness of China's trade in goods, should be in line with the stage of China's economic development and reflect the characteristics of the times.
China's trade in goods, which is the largest in the world, already has the economic basis for further expansion and opening-up, but the quality and benefits of trade development are still different from those of the developed economies, so the overall level of tariffs should be appropriately reduced.
Tariffs are a means of protection for compliance, and the level of tariffs should be commensurate with the competitiveness of the industry, benign competition should be encouraged, and excessive protection is not conducive to the development of the industry and the improvement of quality.
The tariff rate adjustment should take into account the needs of production and consumption.
We will focus on reducing the commodity tax rate, which is high in domestic demand and contributes to the transformation and upgrading of industries, strive to increase the import of niche products where the needs of the people are concentrated, constantly enhance the sense of acquisition by enterprises and the public, and meet the need for the upgrading of the industrial structure and consumption structure.
The strength of tax reduction should take into account the fiscal revenue and the affordability of industrial development.
In the choice of specific tax-reducing goods and the scope of tax reduction, we should coordinate and coordinate the relationship between domestic and foreign markets, upstream and downstream, production and consumption, so as to maintain the steady and positive development momentum of China's economy.
The person-in-charge stressed that this year marks the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up, and that China's initiative to reduce the overall level of import tariffs is a major measure in accordance with China's own need to achieve high-quality development. It is conducive to the overall utilization of both international and foreign resources, promote the improvement of the quality of the domestic supply system and meet the needs of the people for the upgrading of consumption.
This action and initiative shows that China will unswervingly pursue a mutually beneficial and win-win opening-up strategy, firmly support economic globalization, resolutely uphold the principle of free trade and the multilateral trading system, with the WTO at its core, continue to draw the momentum of development from opening up to the world, and make China's development better benefit the world.
Serbia declares its highest operational readiness and the President of the Republic of Serbia will meet tomorrow to discuss the situation in Kosovo.
Nantong quoted the Office of the President of Serbia as saying that Serbian President Vucic had ordered the country's armed forces to enter a state of maximum operational readiness in view of the occupation by the Kosovo Special Forces of access to the water storage lake at the Gazivoda hydroelectric power station in northern Kosovo, which is controlled by the Belgrade side.
On 29 September, the Serbian Minister of Defence, Vulin, declared that the Serbian army was on full operational readiness.
Vulin stressed that as long as the orders issued by Vucic remain in force, Serbia will continue to monitor the current situation in Kosovo, and that the Serbian army will respond regardless of the direction in which the situation is going.
On September 29, Vucic said in an interview that he had briefed the United States, Russia and Europe on the current situation and would travel to Moscow on October 2 to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to seek Putin's support on Kosovo, Russia's Tass news agency reported.
Asked if Serbia needed Russian military support like Syria, Vucic gave a negative answer: "I don't want a major military conflict on our territory."
Vucic also said the full operational readiness of the Serbian army was only intended to form a deterrent to prevent the conflict, but it was also a clear warning that any violence in Kosovo would never be tolerated.
The increase in the operational readiness of the Serbian army is related to two major moves on the part of Kosovo.
According to the Serbian side, in recent days, Albanians have been making extensive arrests in the northern part of Kosovo of ethnic Serbs who have been living there for generations, and the arrested Serbs have not violated any law.
Vucic stated that, since the beating and detention of the head of the Serbian Government's office in Kosovo and Metohija, Mako Juric, by the Kosovo Albanian Army on 26 March this year, there had been an escalation of events in the region, resulting in the unhumane arrest and removal of Serbs.
In addition, more than 100 people, including the self-declared ROSU Special Forces of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Kosovo, armed police and snipers, occupied positions near the water storage lake at the Gazivoda hydroelectric power station, entered the ecological and sports centre near the dyke in the northern part of the Kosovo region and blocked all nearby roads, which were otherwise under the control of the Serbian side.
Vucic pointed out that this military adventure in Kosovo was carried out at the instigation of Western countries, and that the actions of the Kosovo army did not notify the Serbian side in advance, in violation of chapter IX, paragraph 1, of the Brussels Agreement, as well as United Nations Security Council resolution 1244 and the military-technical agreement between Seko.
Vucic has shouted to NATO Secretary-General Stoltenberg, criticizing the hypocrisy of Western countries over Kosovo.
The root cause of the current conflict remains the centuries-old historical feud between the two communities in Kosovo.
With regard to the attribution of Kosovo, there are separate accounts from the Serbs and the Albanians.
Serbia sees Kosovo as the birthplace of the nation and the cradle of culture, because Serbia established its strongest state here in the 12th century, and the Albanians moved in large numbers only after the invasion of the Ottoman Empire and the defeat of the Serbian army to the north.
The Albanians, for their part, maintain that the original tribe of Illyria, who lived in Kosovo in the 4th-5th century B.C., was the ancestor of the Albanians, and that, as a result, Kosovo has been Albanian territory since ancient times
The subjective political division has resulted in intense ethnic, religious and cultural conflicts, resulting in fierce confrontation between Serbs and Albanians in the Kosovo region.
In 1912, the Kosovo Albanians first declared the independence of Albania.
After the First World War, a large number of ethnic Albanians living in the Balkans moved to Turkey, with a relative increase in the proportion of Serbs. In the view of the Serbs, the practice of "only taking back their own land" was seen by the Albanians as a plunder of "Greater Serbism," and the conflict between the two communities intensified.
Kosovo has become a "powder keg" in the Balkans.
In 1999, armed clashes between Albanian separatists in the Kosovo Liberation Army and the Serbian army and police led to the bombing by NATO forces of the Federal Republic of Serbia and Montenegro and the outbreak of the war in Kosovo.
On 17 February 2008, Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia.
Since then, despite the news that Serbia will normalize relations with Kosovo and sign a global and legally binding agreement, it has not been possible to conclude an agreement that has been constrained by various forces, such as the United States, Europe and Russia, due to historical national grievances and geopolitical constraints.
Just a month ago, Vucic made it clear for the first time that he advocated the separation of Serbs from Albanians in Kosovo, once again opening up the conflict between the two communities.
Power communications are still disrupted by Indonesia's strong earthquake and tsunami relief difficulties
According to figures released by the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency in the early hours of June 30, a strong earthquake and a tsunami in Dongara County, Central Sulawesi Province, killed 420 people.
WilemRampangilei, head of Indonesia's disaster relief agency, said the figure was only preliminary statistics for the city of Palu, in the provincial capital of Central Sulawesi, about 80 km from the epicenter, because many of the city's densely populated buildings, such as hotels, shopping malls and warehouses, damaged by the collapse of the earthquake, had not yet been searched for because of the lack of large-scale search and rescue machinery.
On September 29, 2018, local time, a bridge damaged by an earthquake and tsunami collapsed into several knots on Pakistan Road, Indonesia.
As a result of the severe damage to power and communications facilities, Donggara County and the adjacent Siji area are still unconnected "isolated islands" and are unable to count the number of victims.
During the media report, Indonesian Vice President Kara said the death toll could be in the thousands.
Power outages, communications outages, road blockages, airport damage... Strong earthquakes and post-tsunami rescue efforts are difficult.
Due to power outages, some hospitals and rescue settlements in the city of Palu have to rely on fuel for power generation.
Roads into and out of the city have been blocked by landslides, and large transport vehicles, including fuel tankers, have been unable to enter, straining fuel supplies.
Indonesian Social Minister Agus said emergency relief supplies, such as tents, mattresses, blankets, clothing, food and household kits, dispatched by the Ministry from the provinces of South Sulawesi and Gorontalo, near the epicenter, had not yet arrived in the affected areas because of road damage.
Relief materials transferred from the capital, Jakarta, are being transported to the disaster area through air transport aircraft.
In view of the damage to the command tower and runway at Palu airport during the earthquake, all commercial flights have been suspended for the sole take-off and landing of military aircraft carrying relief supplies and personnel in order to ensure safety and security of the rescue.
Wiranto, Indonesia's co-ordinating Minister for Political, Legal and Security Affairs, who directed the rescue in the quake zone, called for the restoration of power supply and commercial airport flight services as soon as possible to ensure the operation of rescue agencies such as hospitals, so as to allow more rescue workers and volunteers and aid supplies to reach the disaster area.
28, there were a series of strong earthquakes in Dungala County, Central Sulawesi Province, Indonesia, including a 7.7-magnitude earthquake at 1702 local time, which triggered a tsunami, causing a major disaster in Palu City, Dungala County and the Xigi region.
China News Agency, Beijing, October 1 (reporter Yin Li) blue sky such as washing, clear sky, colorful sky... Recently, Beijing has continued to open the most beautiful blue sky model, leading thousands of people in Beijing to fancy show pictures on social platforms, in the continuous brush screen in the sense of well-being, saying, "under the blue sky and white clouds," drunk "beautiful skyline, this is the best business card in Beijing."
Since August, Beijing has ushered in the "bluest sky."
Within the city, people can be seen anywhere and anywhere, taking photos with smartphones or holding a single counter-camera.
Weibo, micro-letter circle of friends and other social platforms, can be seen everywhere in the netizen lens of the Forbidden City, Tiananmen, Bird's Nest, Hutong... All kinds of buildings show different beauty against the blue sky.
Some netizens said that such a "scenic blockbuster" is the best urban propaganda film in Beijing; other netizens joked that if such a blue sky brush screen for a long time, people with cervical spondylosis can be cured; and some netizens hope that "this blue can cross the winter to spring and summer, so that the four seasons of the sky curtain in Beijing are blue."
Why do the people of Beijing particularly love to sun the blue sky?
Because people living in the city have suffered from the haze in the past, they are particularly thirsty for the blue sky, and after the "blue sky defense war" in Beijing has continued to improve air quality, the haze has become less and the blue sky has increased, and the people are happy in their eyes, and the sense of
On the day of the National Day, the weather in Beijing is fine.
At 8 a.m., the vast majority of the city's 35 air quality monitoring stations were shown as "first-class excellent" green.
The spontaneous "bluest sky" -themed photography competition on the social platform is still ongoing.
Why is the sky so blue in Beijing recently?
In August, the average concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in Beijing was 35 ug / m3, the best record for the same period in nearly five years, according to the head of the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau.
The real-time concentration of PM2.5 in September is the current number of frequency.
A major factor in the emergence of the "bluest sky" is that weather conditions have been generally favourable in recent times. More importantly, Beijing has consistently carried out the control of air pollution, vigorously promoted the Clean Air Action Plan over the past five years, and the continued release of environmental benefits, which has led to a reduction in the total amount of pollutant emissions in the region, which has laid the foundation for a sustained improvement in air quality.
Beijing officially released and implemented the Beijing Clean Air Action Plan 2013-2017 in 2013.
Under the plan, officials continue to guide non-capital functions, promote clean energy substitution and pollution reduction, and phase out a total of 4,923 coal-fired boilers.
As a result, Beijing has also become the first large city in mainland China to realize full-network natural gas.
The data show that between 2013 and 2017, the average annual concentration of PM2.5 in Beijing decreased by 35.6 per cent; the number of days to meet air quality standards increased by 50 days; the number of days of first-class excellence increased by 25 days; and the number of days of heavy pollution decreased by a total of 35 days, with a marked reduction in the incidence of heavy pollution.
While the air quality continues to improve, Beijing officials, on the basis of a new round of PM2.5 source analysis, issued in September this year the Three-Year Action Plan for Beijing to Win the Blue Sky Defense War, focusing on key prevention and control areas such as diesel trucks, dust and volatile organic matter management, optimizing the adjustment of the transport structure, industrial structure, energy structure and land structure, strengthening regional joint prevention and control, making efforts to strengthen the fine management of the city, promoting green development in an all-round way, striving to keep the "bluest sky" in Beijing, so that it will no longer be "expensive," so that it will return to the background rather than the protagonist in the people's photo album.
During this year's National Day Golden Week, the Municipal Tourism Commission, industry and commerce, city administration, public security and other relevant departments will strengthen the law enforcement inspection of the "one-day tour" market, focus on the "six black" chaos of tourism, and those who violate the law, once verified, will be given a heavier and more severe superimposed punishment in accordance with the law.
Yesterday morning, the municipal government held a special meeting to crack down on illegal "one-day tours" and deployed special operations to further crack down on illegal "one-day tours.
The meeting revealed that focusing on the black ticket, black guide, black society, black car, black shop, black net interest chain interwoven "six black" chaos, the city has launched a special campaign to crack down on illegal "one-day tours" since July 28.
Since the launch of the special operation, the city has accepted a total of 39 complaints of "day trips," a decrease of 63 per cent over the previous year. Since the beginning of this year, the city has accepted 270 complaints of "day trips," a decrease of 62 per cent over the previous year.
In the past two months, the city has seized 248 "black cars," investigated and dealt with 158 violations of the tourist passenger transport business, closed 29 shopping "black shops" and performing arts venues, investigated and dealt with 13 "black clubs" and 27 "black guides," confiscated 26,000 illegal advertisements, dismantled 31 illegal "day-trip" billboards and 3 false bus station cards, investigated and dealt with 1,789 cases of all kinds of travel-related violations, filed 181 cases, imposed a heavy fine of 4.48 million yuan, and detained 111 people involved in travel-related violations.
After rectification, the illegal "one-day tour" chaos has been basically contained, and the "one-day tour" market order has taken a steady and positive trend.
It is said that in recent years, the city has continuously stepped up its efforts to crack down on illegal "one-day tours."
In 2016 and 2017, the Municipal Tourism Commission accepted 1,612 and 897 complaints of "day trips," a decrease of 79 per cent and 44 per cent year-on-year, respectively, but illegal "day trips" were still repeated and often rebounded, and formed a "six-black" chaos with an interwoven chain of interests, such as black ticket collection, black guide, black society, black car, black shop and black net.
Specifically, the street illegal Range Rover personnel is the "black ticket," the illegal website that publishes false tourism information is the "black net," the travel agency engaged in an illegal "day trip" or an institution or individual without the qualifications of the travel agency is the "black society," the tour guide employed by the "black society" is the "black guide," the vehicle used without the qualifications of tourist passengers or the vehicle with the qualifications of tourist passengers to provide passenger services for an illegal "day trip" is the "black car," and eventually they bring the tourists into the designated tourist shopping shop, the "black shop."
In this special operation, the city has continued to increase the fixed inspection and passive inspection of illegal "one-day tours." In response to the high incidence of illegal "one-day tours" and the high impact of tourist routes, the relevant departments send unannounced visiting groups on a daily basis to carry out unannounced visits with the mission, and strictly investigate and deal with them in accordance with the law after finding evidence of violations of laws and regulations.
Among them, the "black car" and "black shop" have become the focus of two special operations.
It is said that without the black car, the illegal "day trip" can not take place, the black car is easy to be found, remembered and investigated, as well as a single high-value fixed asset.
The relevant departments use the road traffic monitoring probe to increase the supervision of the key "one-day tour" line tourism bus vehicles, with technical defense, physical defense and other scientific and technological intelligence means can find and deal with the "black car" in a timely manner.
Tourist shopping "black shop" due to the small number, sitting on the ground operation, has also become a serious focus.
In order to strengthen the deterrence and crackdown on illegal "one-day tours," all functional departments shall, in accordance with the law, impose heavy and severe penalties upon those found to be in violation of the law.
In August this year, the city also held a seminar on legal issues related to the severe fight against illegal "one-day tours," which discussed the means and measures for combining administrative punishment with criminal conviction.
The Municipal Tourism Commission said that in the future, more regular travel agencies will be encouraged to carry out "one-day tours" in Beijing and increase the supply of regular "one-day tours," so as to further crowd out the living space of illegal "one-day tours," and that specific plans are still under study.
In addition, the Municipal Tourism Commission has continued to improve the tourist group electronic itinerary information system to ensure that each team is included in the supervision of the electronic itinerary platform.
From a tourist symbol to a digital economy symbol, what has the town experienced over the years
As the permanent venue of the World Internet Congress, Wu Town how to undertake the summit dividend, has attracted much attention.
Since the first World Internet Congress, the changes in Wuzhen have been seen for all to see over the past five years
In 2014, there were only 12 businesses in the town related to the digital economy and the Internet, and by the third quarter of this year, there were more than 500.
This is a microcosm of the development of the digital economy in Wu Town.
The convening of the Internet Congress has made it possible for local enterprises to accept the inspiration of the digital economy and the digital wave at a zero distance. The desire for enterprise transformation and upgrading is very strong, and traditional manufacturing enterprises have increased their investment and research and development in the fields of machine change and intelligent management.
Jiang Wei, secretary of the Wuzhen Town Party Committee, said Wuzhen will build a new economic empowerment center in the future.
The development of the digital economy cannot be separated from the support of infrastructure.
This year, Wuzhen launched a 5G pilot on the basis of full coverage of the 4G communications network and free WiFi.
At the same time, the city of Tongxiang, where Wu Town is located, as the first county-level city in the country to build a special channel for international Internet data, has also become a hot ground for the development of the Internet industry.
Since the first World Internet Congress, Tongxiang has introduced 565 projects in the digital economy, with a total planned investment of 37.725 billion yuan. In the first three quarters of this year, the core manufacturing industry of the digital economy achieved a total output value of 8.73 billion yuan, with a year-on-year increase of 13 per cent.
"Before Wu Town was a tourist symbol, and later a number of theatrical and cultural symbols. Because of the Internet Congress, it is now the symbol of the Internet and the digital economy."
Shengyangjun, secretary of the Tongxiang Municipal Committee, believes that the dividends of the World Internet Congress have accumulated over time, so there is also a greater need to set up a platform to undertake the superimposed import of talents, projects, technology and other elements.
Tongxiang people Shen Yi has been working outside for 20 years, because of the association with the Internet conference, return home to start a business.
On December 2 last year, with a high-capacity tamper-proof digital technology solution, he walked into the fourth Internet Light Fair, which was favored by a number of customers.
Shen Yi chose to start a business in Wuzhen not only because of the hometown complex, "in Wuzhen, it is easier to recruit people than I thought, our application is also on the ground very quickly, Wuzhen intelligent parking project has our application."
A Wuzhen boulevard presents the spillover effect of the Internet Congress.
This road, which runs through the north and south of Tongxiang, is not only a string of tourist attractions, but also an industrial road.
Relying on it, the scientific innovation agglomeration area of Wu Zhen Avenue came into being.
Journalists have learned that, in the future, Wuzhen Avenue will become the main position for the industrial development of Tongxiang, taking the lead in the application of a large number of achievements, such as intelligent medical care, intelligent old age and intelligent government, bringing together industries that account for 80% of the city's GDP and a large number of high-level talents.
Tsunami triggered by a strong earthquake in Indonesia has killed at least 410 people
The earthquake in Central Sulawesi province has killed 410 people, 97 of whom have been identified, according to the head of the Public Information Bureau of the police in Jakarta, Indonesia, on the evening of 29.
Another 29 people are missing and 540 injured.
Palu airport is still closed at the moment.
With active treatment, the survival rate of premature babies at 29 weeks and above in China has reached 98 per cent, which has reached the level of developed countries.
China new net Shanghai September 30 (Chen Jing Luo Yanqian) The National Children's Medical Center and the Affiliated Pediatrics Hospital of Fudan University revealed on September 30 that it had introduced Canada's advanced methods in the leading project on improving the quality of prognosis of hospitalized premature babies in China's NICU.
The results of the project show that, after active treatment, the survival rate of premature babies at 29 weeks and above in China has reached 98 per cent, which has reached the level of developed countries, but there is still much room for improvement in the non-complication survival rate of very young premature babies and premature babies.
For the past 20 years, the Chinese government has been paying attention to the treatment of newborns.
At present, the infant mortality rate in Shanghai has dropped to 3.71 per thousand, which is significantly lower than the national average and has reached the advanced level in the developed countries.
Through four years of unremitting efforts, the project to improve the prognosis quality of premature babies in China's NICU has greatly improved the survival quality of premature babies.
Professor Cao Yun, director of the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of the Affiliated Paediatric Hospital of Fudan University, told reporters that while improving the survival rate of premature babies, it is important to reduce the survival quality of premature babies, reduce the incidence of complications, improve the prognosis of neurodevelopment, and improve the overall outcome of children. It is important to improve the overall survival quality and population quality of premature babies. It is an important issue of concern to the paediatric and newborn paediatrics community at home and abroad, and it is also a key issue of concern to the project.
Through four years of unremitting efforts, China's NICU project to improve the prognosis and quality of premature babies in hospital has included tens of thousands of premature babies aged 33 weeks and below, resulting in a one-third reduction in the mortality rate of premature infants of small gestational age and small birth weight in China, while the incidence of serious complications of premature babies has been significantly reduced, greatly improving the quality of life of premature babies.
Through the establishment of a nationwide collaborative network for the improvement of neonatal quality, the introduction of the concept of collaborative quality improvement, and the radiation of 25 collaborative hospitals throughout China, the project has established a complete, systematic and effective collaborative quality improvement method for the improvement of the prognosis of premature babies and the improvement of the level of neonatal treatment, which is
The Affiliated Pediatrics Hospital of Fudan University is working with the national neonatal paediatrics force to develop guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections, based on the accumulated experience of the project, so as to provide reference and guidance for the standardized diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections in China.
It is understood that in the "Prognostic Quality Improvement Project for Premature Infants in China," paediatric hospitals have introduced the EPIQ method to 25 large NICUs in 19 provinces across the country, working to solve the problem of premature infant infections that plague neonatal care units in China.
After more than 10 years of continuous improvement, the non-complication survival rate of premature babies in Canada has increased by about one-third, and Canada is now one of the best countries in the world.
The EPIQ method has now been applied to all NICUs in Canada and has been adopted by six countries.
Paediatric hospitals revealed that the results showed a 35 per cent drop in premature infections two years after EPIQ intervention, along with a 20 per cent drop in antibiotic use.
In the future, the Affiliated Paediatric Hospital of Fudan University will continue to promote and implement this method throughout the country, with a view to comprehensively reducing the incidence of all complications in premature infants and improving the quality of treatment for newborns throughout the country.
At present, it is an indisputable fact that there are differences and inequalities in the level of treatment in all regions of China.
According to Professor Cao Yun, as an important construction unit of the National Children's Medical Center, paediatric hospitals will play a leading role in radiation. The study covers a number of western provinces, including Xinjiang, Guizhou, Gansu and Shaanxi, with a view to gradually promoting the homogenization and standardization of neonatal treatment throughout the country.
It is understood that the Affiliated Paediatric Hospital of Fudan University, in conjunction with the national neonatal paediatric force, is developing guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections based on the accumulated experience of the project, so as to provide reference and guidance for the standardized diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections in China.
It has been revealed that, in 2019, the China Neonatal Collaboration Network, located at the Affiliated Pediatrics Hospital of Fudan University, will work with 63 hospitals across the country to carry out the next phase of national quality improvement, with a view to promoting the homogenized development of the level of treatment of newborns in China.
Wu Shire, director of the Shanghai Health and Family Planning Commission, said Shanghai can become a central city in Asia, not only in research, but also in the construction of the entire service system, the quality of services and the results of services should have a place in Asia, so as to truly reflect China's medical level.
Xin Yiping: Build up the heart of the "monument to the hero" - written on the fifth anniversary of the martyr.
On September 30, on the eve of the 69th birthday of the Republic, we ushered in the fifth anniversary of the martyr, and party and state leaders, such as Xi Jinping, came to Tiananmen Square to attend a ceremony to lay a basket of flowers to the people's heroes.
At this moment, wherever you are, please pay tribute to Yingli.
Remembrance Day, is a relive, is a wake-up call.
Open the heavy history, behind the name of every martyr, is a living life.
They, also have fiery youth, have sincere love, have concerned family.
However, because they believe that "the doctrine of our faith is the truth of the universe," and in order to "spare the suffering of the next generation," they are willing to sacrifice all their own.
"I will cry out for China for a day to survive."
Across time and space, the British people set up a spiritual signpost to guide the way forward.
"Where to come from, where to go," "what kind of person to be," read English, it is not difficult to come up with the answer.
In memory of Yingli, the most important thing is to build a "monument to the hero" in the heart.
According to incomplete statistics, since the years of the Revolutionary War, about 20 million martyrs have died valiantly for national independence, the liberation of the people and the prosperity and strength of the country.
For a variety of reasons, many of the pioneers did not even leave their names.
Countless heroes water their ideals with blood, practice their faith with their lives, remember their English names, pass on their spirit, is to protect the roots and souls of the nation.
This "Monument to the Heroes" is not allowed to be defaced or destroyed.
For some time, historical nihilism, pan-entertainment and other undercurrents have surged.
All kinds of distorted history, derogatory practices, challenge the conscience of justice, deranged value judgment, cause the public anger and alarm of the whole society.
There can be no desecration, and the hero cannot forget.
To the act of touching the bottom line, must not be resigned, must dare to light the sword, with the rule of law and justice to safeguard the British dignity.
On May 1 this year, the Law on the Protection of Heroes and Martyrs came into force.
Judging from the judicial practice, the judgment of some cases is very popular, not only to effectively safeguard the glorious image of the British in accordance with the law, but also to release the positive energy of worshiping heroes and worshiping their ancestors.
A nation with a pursuit cannot be without a hero, a country with an ideal cannot be without a vanguard.
It has become a universal social consensus to remember the memory of the ancestors and call for heroes.
At present, there are millions of memorial facilities throughout the country, and more than 100 million people visit the Martyrs' Cemetery every year.
The heart of the heart is the most solid foundation.
Let the worship of the hero, the defense of the hero, the learning of the hero, the love of the hero into the wind, let the British spirit into the national blood, a "monument to the hero" will stand between the earth and the sky, deep in the heart of the heart.
Brussels (Reuters) - The European Union took a non-confrontational stance against Italy on Friday after Italy flouted EU demands and surprised the market with a massive budget deficit plan, but the European Union may take a more aggressive stance if Italy sticks to too bold goals.
Italy's Euroskeptic government aims to run a budget deficit equivalent to 2.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) over the next three years, suggesting that there has been no debt reduction in the face of deficit reduction alone
"We have no interest in the crisis between the Executive Committee and Italy," Moscovici, a member of the European Commission's Executive Committee on Economic Affairs, said Friday, in a cautious response as EU proposals and sanctions could have little impact on Italy.
EU officials and diplomats still hope that market forces will persuade Italy to adjust its budget plan before Italy's formal submission to the European Commission in mid-October.
After the government announced its plan, the euro fell to its lowest level in nearly two weeks on Friday, while Italian bond yields hit their highest level in three weeks.
If the deficit target remains unchanged by the October deadline, the European Commission is likely to veto Italy's draft budget, something it has never done to any country.
Italy's current fiscal plan "appears to be at odds with the Stability and Growth Pact," he said at a later meeting in the Latvian capital, Riga, on Friday, referring to the EU's fiscal rules.
But he did not say how this would trigger a response from the European Union.
Tenderers may submit an application for participation in the open tender by October 26 this year.
Previously, the Russian Ministry of Agriculture had made China one of the priority markets for Russian agricultural exports.
The Russian Agricultural Supervision Bureau announced in May that Russia's grain exports to China exceeded 1 million tons for the first time in the agricultural year, with an innovative record.
The bureau predicts that China is likely to be among the top 10 Russian food importers.
Sapporo, China News Agency (CNA), on September 30, following the first 3-0 victory over Cuba, the Chinese women's volleyball team again won two consecutive victories in the group stage of the 2018 World Championships with a 3-0 victory over Turkey.
But compared with the first battle, the Chinese women's volleyball team is more difficult.
A total of 24 teams took part in the 2018 Women's World Championships, with the Chinese women's volleyball team in Group B with Italy, Turkey, Bulgaria, Canada and Cuba.
In terms of the world rankings and overall strength of the teams in Group B, Turkey and Italy are the main opponents of the Chinese team.
After the start of the game on the same day, the Chinese team entered the state relatively quickly, took the lead in the opening game, maintained the advantage, put a lot of pressure on the opponent on both serve and blocking the net, and won the first game with 25: 18.

It will help to form a virtuous circle of the optimization of the supply structure of tourism and the steady expansion of the demand for tourism consumption, so as to promote the sustained and healthy development of scenic spots and tourism.
At the same time, the National Development and Reform Commission stressed that all localities should strengthen the price order of scenic spots, guide scenic spots to upgrade their services, and ensure that the price reduction is not healthy.
In addition, the National Development and Reform Commission has carried out special inspections on issues such as the recent decline in ticket prices in individual scenic spots, as reflected in the media, and has asked all localities to deal with them seriously, respond to social concerns in a timely manner and effectively put the price reduction in place.
The Trade Promotion Bureau carries out the work of short, medium and long-term optimization in an orderly manner
The Macao Trade and Investment Promotion Bureau has submitted a short, medium and long-term report on the optimization of "major investment migrants" and "skilled migrants." In addition to stepping up the promotion and implementation of the work contained in the report, the Macao Trade and Investment Promotion Bureau has been continuously listening to the views of the community and continuously optimizing the contents of the report and related work.
The Trade Promotion Bureau will introduce the relevant optimization work to all sectors of the community as soon as possible.
Of these, five are short-term measures to be implemented this year; five are medium-term measures to be implemented in 2019; and one is a long-term measure.
In addition, the Trade and Development Bureau has conducted a comprehensive review of the internal management system in accordance with the direction of the Secretary for Economic and Financial Affairs, Mr David Leung.
The five short-term measures to be implemented during this year include:
1. To carry out a review. Priority will be given to cases which are about to expire for seven years, those referred to in the ICAC report, and new renewal cases. Cases where there are indications of impropriety or violation of the law will be referred to the relevant judicial authorities for follow-up action on their own
2. On-site inspection of projects involving "major investment migrants." By late September, more than 20 investment projects had been inspected;
3. To conduct a comprehensive review of the current evaluation system. Six principles for the analysis of investment projects have been re-established in the evaluation of applications for "major investment migrants." In the evaluation of applications for "skilled migrants," the examination and approval mechanism will be improved by clarifying the elements conducive to the development of Australia and the conditions under which priority will be given to the recruitment of talents. A list of "ten jobs in the five industries" has been drawn up to give priority to the recruitment of talents in line with the policy direction of the HKSAR Government;
4. Increasing the transparency of information, including plans to gradually publish the approval criteria, scoring criteria and weights, and to further refine and make public the approval data, starting in the fourth quarter of this year;
5. With regard to the improvement of the confirmation mechanism, verification of work in Australia prior to confirmation has been required, and major investments must be checked on-site and financial statements submitted.
The five medium-term measures to be implemented in 2019 include:
1. To establish a mechanism for hearing the views of the Talent Development Committee and the Economic Development Committee on a regular basis. A working meeting with the Economic Development Committee was held in September to discuss the establishment of such a mechanism.
2. Require the applicant to submit annually the financial statements made by an independent third party in order to keep under review the operating status of the investment project;
3. Further standardize and electronically process the application and approval of individual cases in order to reduce human error;
4. A comprehensive review of the current staffing, in line with the implementation of a number of optimization measures;

The national film-free cotton on-site observation and discussion and exchange activities experts walked into the experimental field and heard a briefing by the representative of the team of academician Yishun of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.
Sino-new net Xinjiang Shaya September 30 electricity (Geng Dandan Wang Xiaojun) is located in Shaya County, Xinjiang, film-free cotton cultivation test base, film-free cotton growth is happy, compared with the ground-film cotton next to "no less color," a cluster of snow-white cotton race to "open," full of branches.
From September 27 to 28, the national film-free cotton on-the-spot observation and discussion and exchange activities were held in Shaya County, Xinjiang.
The reporter learned at the observation conference that the film-free cotton technology system, with "medium cotton 619" and its supporting cultivation measures as the main body, has initially achieved the goal of film-free cultivation of cotton fields, reduced the pollution of the residual film of cotton fields in Xinjiang to the ecological environment and raw cotton, and made great progress in the research and demonstration of the comprehensive technology of film-free cotton.
Academician Yu Shu Xun, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, a famous cotton genetic breeder and chief scientist of the cotton system of the country's modern agricultural industry and technology system, introduced the growth of film-free cotton to Zhou Guomodel, secretary of the Party committee of the Zhejiang University of Agriculture and Forestry.
"Our research and development of film-free cotton comprehensive technology can fully realize the cultivation of cotton without ground film, can completely solve the problem of residual film pollution, and realize green cotton planting."
Yu Shu Xun, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, introduced it.
Xinjiang is the most important cotton-producing area in China, and according to the National Bureau of Statistics, the area under cotton cultivation in Xinjiang in 2017 was 35 million mu, accounting for 61 per cent of the country's cotton area.
Since the introduction of the film into China in 1982, the area covered by various types of crops in Xinjiang has reached more than 50 million mu, and the annual use of the film is about 300,000 tons.
Among them, the cotton mulch coverage reached 100%, and the cotton mulch accounted for about 60% of the use of the mulch in Xinjiang.
Film-free cotton to measure the production, the cotton yield can fully realize the yield of 320 kg to 350 kg per acre.
With the increasing amount of soil membrane input in Xinjiang, the recovery rate of residual membranes is low, the amount of residual membranes in the soil has gradually increased, and the residual membranes cause damage to the soil structure, which has a serious impact on the sustainable development of agriculture.
The residual membrane not only causes serious pollution to the soil, but also has a great influence on the quality of cotton fiber.
At present, more than one-third of the cotton fields in Xinjiang have achieved mechanized harvesting.
In 2017, Xinjiang machine cotton mining area of about 14 million mu.
In the process of cotton harvesting, a large amount of shredded film on the surface and on the cotton plant, the shredded film doped in the raw cotton is difficult to remove in the process of raw cotton processing, and can not be completely removed in the process of follow-up textile processing, which seriously affects the quality of textile products.
On September 28, the national film-free cotton on-site observation and discussion and exchange activities were held in Shaya County, Xinjiang.
In an effort to solve cotton field film pollution, simplify cotton planting technology, and improve cotton field efficiency, Yu tree quickly led his team through eight years to implement the cultivation of "medium cotton 619" film-free cotton technology, so as to "add wings" to the green development of agriculture in Xinjiang.
Yu tree quickly introduced, through innovative breeding new ideas, the cultivation of a new line of land cotton "medium cotton 619" with special precocious, saline-resistant, low-temperature and high-yield.
"Under the conditions of film-free cultivation in the southern region of Xinjiang, a series of supporting measures have been implemented, such as the matching of film-free seeding machinery, the improvement of seeding depth, the shallow burying of drip pipe under film-free conditions, the screening of suitable seeding density, and reasonable chemical control."
At present, demonstration bases for film-free cotton have been set up in Aksu, Kurler and Arar, with a yield of 4,800 kg per hectare.
The cultivation of cotton without membranes has achieved high yield, conservation and environmental protection, and improved the overall benefits.
Zhang Donghai, an agronomist at the Agricultural Institute of the Third Division of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, said that through the research and demonstration of film-free cotton cultivation technology over the past six years, the yield of film-free cottonseed cotton can fully achieve a yield of 320 kg to 350 kg per acre, or perhaps even higher.
"There is a great prospect for the popularization of film-free cotton cultivation technology."
Zhang Donghai believes that, at present, the film-free cotton cultivation technology can completely solve the problem of soil residual membrane pollution, but at present, there is still a certain gap between the economic benefits and the cultivation of the film.
"The support of the purchase price of cotton will be conducive to the promotion in the future."
Yu said that, as the next step, he and his team will continue to carry out in-depth research and widespread application of film-free cotton, strengthen the film-free cotton industry, and completely solve the problem of soil pollution caused by the film.

During the side meeting, a Chinese journalist was taken away by the police.
What comment do you have, please?

We are firmly opposed to any interference by any organization in the affairs of Hong Kong in any way.
Any attempt or act to promote the "independence of Hong Kong" is futile.

At present, China-US relations are once again at a crossroads, opening up better prospects if the two sides can take a positive and inclusive view of each other, expand and deepen positive cooperation, and properly manage differences, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in a speech to the US Foreign Relations Committee on Friday.
"China-US relations are our common asset, and we need to take care of it together.
He expressed the hope that knowledgeable people from all walks of life in the two countries would take practical action to safeguard the healthy and stable development of China-US relations and work together to push China-US relations in the right direction.
Wang Yi also stressed once again that China will certainly come out of a different development path from that of the traditional big countries.
This path with Chinese characteristics determines that China will not and will not repeat the mistakes of national hegemony, and that China will neither become the United States, challenge the United States, nor replace the United States.
In a speech entitled "Opportunities or challenges, partners or adversaries," Wang Yi said the deep crux of the problem is that some American friends believe that China will also become a bully, and will even challenge and replace US leadership in the world.
"This is clearly a major strategic miscalculation."
But this self-imagined suspicion is spreading, amplifying existing contradictions, giving rise to new doubts, and making it more difficult and more resistant to solving specific problems between China and the United States, he said.
Wang Yi pointed out that China is on a path of peaceful development.
The Chinese have never had a gene for foreign expansion.
We believe that all countries can live together in harmony and exchange experiences.
Whether in the past, now or in the future, China will neither copy the foreign model nor ask other countries to copy China's practices.
Earlier, in a meeting with former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in New York, Wang Yi said that China-US cooperation would be win-win and confrontation was bound to lose.
China has always been committed to the development of long-term, healthy and stable China-US relations, so as to achieve non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation.
China's new office held a press conference on Tuesday to introduce and interpret the white paper "Facts and China's position on the economic and trade friction between China and the United States."
China is willing to work to push bilateral trade in a more balanced direction, and hopes that the US side will also show a positive stance, Fu Zi-sheng, deputy minister of China's Ministry of Commerce, said at a press conference.
Foreign media reported that the Indonesian island of Sulawesi was hit by a strong earthquake and tsunami on September 28, causing serious damage to several cities along the coast, and the latest news showed that the number of people killed had risen to 1,200.
The town of Donggala, near the epicenter of Palu, was reportedly hit by two rounds of tsunami, and as the "golden 72 hours" of rescue passed, authorities believe the number of people killed will continue to rise.
Rescuers carry an earthquake survivor rescued from under the rubble of a restaurant in Palu, Central Sulawesi province, Indonesia, September 30, 2018, local time.
Officials from the disaster relief department said the tsunami brought huge waves of up to 6 metres, and the impact of the earthquake and tsunami exceeded previous estimates.
It is reported that at the time of the earthquake and tsunami, hundreds of people were celebrating the holiday on the beach in Palu, and many were killed by huge waves.
Officials said the tsunami came ashore at a speed of 800 km / h and many buildings and infrastructure were destroyed.
Thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed and a tsunami-triggered mudslide cut off a major road in Palu, he said.
A bridge across a coastal river collapsed in Sulawesi.
On September 30, local time, Indonesian President Joko visited the city of Central Sulawesi Palu, which was hit by the earthquake.
Indonesian President Joko, who visited the disaster area on September 30, said he had sent troops to assist in the search and rescue and called on the victims to be patient.
Zoko pointed out that the rescue operation was difficult because of heavy machinery and a shortage of staff.
He learned that there was a lack of supplies such as water, food and fuel in many parts of the disaster area, and that many businesses had been shut down after the earthquake and had sent aircraft to drop supplies.
He called on the victims to be patient and to stay in their original position to wait for help.
Search and rescue workers in the city of Palu said they heard calls for help from a collapsed hotel in the city, but some people needed to save people with their bare hands because there was no heavy machine to remove the rubble.
Indonesia's Vice President Kara said power and communications were cut off in some areas, leading to a lack of information, and the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami could eventually rise to thousands.

At the same time, the provincial courts have organized and carried out, in accordance with the law, a batch of fines, a batch of detentions, a batch of restrictions on consumption, a batch of punishment for breach of trust, and a batch of "five batch" activities for the transfer of the crime of refusal.

"Where can I take a taxi, please?
We want to go to Golden Bauhinia Square to see the National Day flag-raising ceremony!
Mr. and Mrs. Song, who deliberately flew from Ningxia to Shenzhen to take the first bus on the National Day of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong high-speed railway in Shenzhen, made enquiries to reporters when they were interviewed by the China News Agency at the West Kowloon Station in Hong Kong on the morning of October 1.
On the morning of 1 October, in celebration of the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region held a solemn flag-raising ceremony at Golden Bauhinia Square.
According to immigration control station statistics, as of September 30, the number of passengers entering Hong Kong through the high-speed rail West Kowloon Station had exceeded 300,000.
On the occasion of the 69th anniversary of the motherland, the West Kowloon Border Post is expected to see a peak of visitors to Hong Kong on October 1 and 2.
On January 1, at around 7 a.m. in the arrival lobby, a large number of mainland passengers took advantage of the National Day Golden Week to travel to Hong Kong on a high
Mrs. Song told reporters that the National Day holiday is a rare long holiday of the year. It is her long-standing wish to see the flag raised in Hong Kong's Golden Bauhinia Square. She is particularly happy and excited to be able to achieve this wish on National Day.
However, at present, flights between Ningxia and Hong Kong are inconvenient. After opening the Hong Kong section of the high-speed railway, Mr. Song made enquiries about the train timetable and found that the first bus could arrive at 7: 3 a.m. to connect the city's means of transport to Golden Bauhinia Square.
He lamented with the reporter: "High-speed rail is really too convenient, fast and accurate time!"
The 70 short one-hour trains that travel daily to and from Guangzhou South, Shenzhen North, Fukuda and West Kowloon have brought residents from the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Grand Bay region to Hong Kong
After his arrival in Hong Kong, Mr. Liu, who lives in Shenzhen, is preparing to go to his Hong Kong friends at the Convergence Mountain at the top of Central.
"Both the Mainland and Hong Kong are on holiday on the National Day. We intend to challenge ourselves to see if we can walk the 50-kilometer Hong Kong Island Trail," Mr. Liu said.
He explained that, had it not been for the opening of the high-speed railway, convenient travel and sufficient time, they would not have been able to easily try such a long distance of mountain activities.
Mrs. Yang, from Dongguan, took her 10-year-old son on a high-speed rail to Hong Kong for a piano competition. She proudly told reporters that her son had been studying the piano for three years and that it made sense to spend the National Day in this way.
She had been coming to Hong Kong by bus, but it was time-consuming. She was worried about affecting her son's state. She came by high-speed rail this time through Shenzhen. She was even more impressed by the Hong Kong leg of the trip. "It was like taking the subway, especially fast, I didn't have time to take a picture," she told reporters.
On September 23, at 6: 44, the G5711 "Harmony" high-speed train set off from the Shenzhen North Station and sped all the way. A few minutes later, the train entered the Hong Kong section of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong high-speed railway, the first officially operated high-speed train in Hong Kong.
The Hong Kong section of high-speed rail, integrated into the country's 25,000-kilometer high-speed rail network and direct to 38 long-distance stations across the country, has also welcomed mainland passengers from different provinces in the north and south of the country.
Mr. Gao, who came to Hong Kong to visit his family from Changsha on a long holiday, told reporters that the high-speed railway had to sit north of Shenzhen, take the subway through Hong Kong and turn around the city's means of transport. He was in trouble and time-consuming. He was now sitting directly in the Kowloon Centre and would be able to eat his children's lunch at home.
The convenience of the "place-to-place inspection" clearance process is beyond imagination. "In less than 10 minutes, both have passed," he said.
The West Kowloon Station, which is adjacent to the airport's fast line and connects land and air traffic, has also become the first choice for a large number of transit passengers.
Miss Wu, from Fujian, was going to spend Golden Week with her boudoirs from Hong Kong to the Philippines. She pushed her luggage at the gate in West Kowloon and told reporters: "I was afraid she would not be able to catch the plane. I didn't think it was so fast."
The new US-Mexico-Canada trade deal will retain US President Donald Trump's ability to implement the threat of a 25 per cent tariff increase on imported cars, while essentially exempting passenger cars, pickup trucks and auto parts imported from Canada and Mexico from paying tariffs, according to a subsidiary arrangement to the trade deal released on Monday.
If Trump imposes so-called "Chapter 232" tariffs on cars for national security reasons, both Mexico and Canada will have a quota of 2.6 million tax-exempt passenger vehicles exported to the United States each year.
Under the subsidiary arrangement, the pickup trucks produced in the two countries will be fully exempted from customs duties.
If Trump imposes additional tariffs on cars, Mexico will receive an annual tax exemption quota of $108 billion for auto parts, and Canada will receive a quota of $32.4 billion.
Both quotas are well above the current level of production in both countries, providing room for growth in exports from both countries.
Washington / Mexico Sept 28 - After several days of debate, US President Donald Trump's administration and Canada are making concrete efforts to resolve trade-policy differences, raising hopes that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is expected to maintain the form of a tripartite agreement, Mexico said Friday.
Despite the lack of details, the apparent progress was enough to prompt the Governments of Mexico and the United States to suddenly halt their plans to publish the text of the trade agreement between the two sides, giving Canada more time to join the agreement.
Mexico's president-designate, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, told reporters in Mexico that the U.S. government had made new counter-proposals to the Canadian government and said he would continue to press for all three countries to participate in NAFTA.
Ildefonso Guajardo, Mexico's economy minister, said the timing of the submission of the text of the trade agreement between the US and Mexico to Mexican and US legislation had been delayed because the governments of Canada and the United States had tried to reach an agreement "very seriously.
"Within the next 48 hours, we will know whether we have reached a text of the tripartite agreement or whether we have to publish the text of the agreement between the two sides," Guajardo said.
Guajardo said his U.S. and Canadian counterparts had "specifically asked" for the release of the text to be delayed.
A spokesman for the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) did not comment on the text of the trade agreement between the United States and Mexico and the consultations between the United States and Canada.
Officials from the Office of the Prime Minister and the Office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Canada did not respond to requests for comment on the counter-proposal.
In a conservation centre on the outskirts of Pretoria, South Africa's capital, it is difficult to see anything unusual, but they are nothing, according to foreign media reports.
"This is the first young lion ever born in artificial insemination - the first pair in the world," the University of Pretoria announced.
In-school scientists are working on the reproductive system of the lioness in Africa.
Ganswett, director of the Institute of Mammal Research at the University of Pretoria, said the two young lions, a female and a male, born on August 25, were quite healthy and normal.
His team finally reached the breakthrough after an intensive 18-month trial.
"We collect sperm from a healthy male lion," Ganswintert said in a media interview.
Next, the researchers and other lionesses were artificially inseminated when the hormone content in the body reached an appropriate level.
"Fortunately, it turned out to be a success," Mr Ganswint said.
The researchers "tried several times, but, unexpectedly, did not spend much effort," he said.
He said the above-mentioned research breakthrough can be repeated, and scientists hope to use the technology to save endangered large cats.
According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, lions have been extinct in 26 countries in Africa, and the total number of surviving wild lions has plummeted by 43 per cent over the past 20 years, leaving only about 20,000.
The African lion is listed by the group as a vulnerable animal.
"If we don't do something for this animal, they're going to face extinction," Ganswintert said.
He said the new technology did not require lions to be reared, but simply injected sperm into a pregnant lioness, as was done in North America and Europe for captive elephants.
South Korea's exports fell by the largest in more than two years in September, but analysts blamed the decline on fewer working days and said global demand for South Korean goods remained strong despite rising trade tensions between China and the United States.
Indeed, South Korea's average daily exports increased last month.
In addition, initial value data released earlier showed a double-digit increase in exports in the first weeks of September before the long holiday.
South Korean exports fell year-on-year in September, the biggest decline since July 2016, larger than the 5.7 per cent decline forecast by 11 analysts in the Reuters survey.
Initial values released on Monday showed exports of $50.6 billion in September, down from $51.2 billion in August.
While a growing US-China trade dispute could hurt other export-dependent Chinese neighbors, South Korea's exports to China grew 7.8 per cent in September, expanding for the 23rd consecutive month.
South Korean exports to the United States fell 11.8 per cent, owing to a decline in sales of oil products.
Overseas sales of memory chips and petroleum products in South Korea grew by 28.3 per cent and 13.5 per cent, respectively, although the market is worried that the so-called "super cycle" of chips may have peaked.
"However, the impact of the trade conflict will be difficult to avoid, because South Korea's exports depend to a considerable extent on the US and Chinese markets."
Imports fell 2.1 per cent to $40.8 billion, also less than the 3.1 per cent increase estimated in the Reuters survey.
The initial value of the trade surplus in September was $9.7 billion, up from $6.9 billion in August.
Thanks to the United States and European Union countries, global manufacturing will remain buoyant, which is a positive factor for South Korean exports, the Ministry of Industry said.
"Higher export prices caused by higher oil prices will also be good for exports in the second half of this year," the statement said.
"But the continuation of the trade conflict between the United States and China, combined with increased market volatility following US interest-rate hikes, are negative pressures on exports," he said.
Exports rose to an average of $2.6 billion per working day in September, compared with $2.1 billion in August.
South Korea's Mid-Autumn Festival falls on September 24-26, so there are only 19.5 working days in September, four days less than in the same period last year.
South Korean exports grew by 4.7 per cent in January-September compared with the same period last year.
According to the Nikkei / Markit Purchasing Managers' Index, South Korean manufacturing activity picked up in September, but was supported by domestic orders, which threatened to overshadow the outlook for another export, as orders from China and Japan fell.
North Korean media criticise the United States for not easing sanctions on North Korea
North Korea's Labor News published an op-ed article on September 30, criticizing the United States for seeking dialogue with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea while not easing sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, calling it a "paradox."
The article said that on July 14, US Secretary of State Pompeo said that "in order to achieve the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, the key is the implementation of sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea," stressing that the position of the United States to continue to implement the United Nations sanctions resolution remains unchanged.
In Singapore's DPRK-US joint statement, the two sides pledged to establish a new DPRK-US relationship commensurate with the aspirations of the people of the DPRK and the United States for peace and prosperity.
There is no doubt that it is contradictory for the United States to step up its sanctions crackdown and to call for dialogue
The article said that if we are to establish new DPRK-US relations, build a permanently consolidated peace system on the Korean peninsula and achieve the complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, we should put the building of trust first, starting with what can be done and resolving it in stages.
The article also said the United States should understand that a crackdown on sanctions would not work for North Korea.
The article said that even the "North Devonsk" before the Kazan was a source of admiration for the US military.
"We will meet a strong potential adversary," the National Interest magazine quoted the US Navy as saying. "Just look at the submarine North Devonsk is enough."
Fogo, the current commander-in-chief of the US Navy in Europe, also praised the submarine "North Devonsk."
"The submarine is impressive, and a look at the development of the Russian navy, how it uses its resources, shows that its main efforts in research and development are, first and foremost, to strengthen the submarine fleet," he said.
But the National Interest magazine still believes that the United States maintains an advantage over Russia in this field.
"I believe there is still an asymmetrical advantage in the West," Forgo said.
Earlier, it had been reported that the Russian navy would install the submarine Kazan in 2019.
The multi-purpose submarines Kazan, Novosibirsk, Krasnoyarsk and Alhangelsk are all modified "white wax tree-M," with a displacement of 13,800 tons, a submersible depth of 520 metres, a staffing complement of 64 people, and an underwater speed of 31 knots, which will carry mines, torpedoes and "caliber" and "onyx" cruise missiles.

If the circumstances of the violation are serious, they shall be given serious treatment, such as talking, informing of criticism, suspending the broadcast of advertisements until the broadcast of the frequency channel, etc., and shall be publicly exposed to the public as appropriate.
In recent years, the General Administration of Radio and Television has repeatedly called for the suspension of illegal advertisements.
This year, the State Administration of Radio and Television issued a notice publicly calling for the suspension of advertisements for serious violations, such as "0-bubble fruit milk," "Sharva cocktail," "Bonritt plant anti-breeding dew," and exaggerating exaggerated propaganda and misleading the audience.
The General Administration of Radio and Television has formulated a number of regulations and circulars to regulate the conduct of advertisements broadcast on radio and television.
The Circular on Further Strengthening the Administration of Advertising for Television Shopping Shorts on the Television Channel stipulates that television Shopping Shorts shall not be broadcast on the television channels between 18: 00 and 24: 00 every day.
In the broadcast of short television shopping advertisements at other times, the host shall not be used for publicity, the exaggerated voice, tone and movement of "hawking" shall not be used for publicity, the publicity such as "orthopaedic," "plastic," "fat-permeating" and "fat-throwing" shall not be used, or the disguised promotion of breast enhancement and weight-loss products shall not exceed 1 (once) per hour per day, and each shall not exceed 3 minutes.

The circular also stipulates that radio and television broadcasting organizations should strictly examine the qualifications, certificates and other legal materials for the advertising of health information, such as medical care, medicines, medical devices and health food, and resolutely prohibit the broadcast of sex-related advertisements.
In order to standardize the form of health information advertising, advertisements should not be published in disguised form in the form of health information feature programs.
Special programmes on health information should focus on the introduction of scientific knowledge such as disease prevention, control and treatment. They should not contain advertising content such as medical treatment, drugs, medical devices and health food, and should not be certified in the name of patients and doctors, pharmacists, experts, etc.
"For the first time, we have adjusted the format of the MAKS International Air and Space Salon. We have proposed China as the host country. Our Chinese counterparts have agreed and accepted our invitation," Manturov said.
Not long ago, Chinese President Xi Jinping attended the Fourth Eastern Economic Forum at the invitation of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
This is the first time that he has attended the Forum.
Ignore the American threat!
The European Union is likely to reach a crude oil purchase agreement with Iran
The US government has announced that it will restart a new round of sanctions against Iran in November, and has even urged other countries to reduce their imports of Iranian oil.
America's allies, however, do not seem to have listened to it.
29, in an interview, Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif Zarif revealed that Tehran was close to an agreement with the European Union on the sale of crude oil, despite US threats to impose sanctions on any country doing business with Iran, the New York Times reported.
The central purpose of the agreement is to try to establish a new payment mechanism, in the form of barter or local currency, to replace dollar transactions.
The purpose of the approach is to hope to bypass the United States and to prevent the United States from impeding financial transfers.
At the same time, while the EU is working to broker the deal, some French and British officials also have concerns that, if it comes to fruition, it would be the most open confrontation between the EU and the US, which opposes the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.
In an hour-long interview, Zarif's words sounded more optimistic than they have been in recent months, US media said.
Because the agreement has the ability to "peel off" America's traditional allies and effectively break the US side's attempts to cut Iran's revenue.
"This will ensure that we sell oil and benefit," Zarif said, arguing that countries have a legitimate right to trade with Iran under the agreement reached in 2015.
EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini also said a few days ago that "no sovereign state or organization can accept others to decide who they can trade with."
However, she also predicts that, before the US government launches its next sanctions in November, US leaders are likely to resort to a range of financial means aimed at banks, businessmen and countries that do business with Tehran.
In May, the US government unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal on the grounds that the agreement was flawed, saying it could not permanently ban Iran from producing nuclear fuel.
The US side then threatened to ban companies that buy Iranian oil and other goods from doing business in the United States.
The threat caused some companies to withdraw from Tehran and the Iranian currency plummeted.
Companies such as Airbus and French oil giant Total have canceled billions of dollars in investment in Iraq.
British and French officials have said the US government could "prevail."
To be sure, US sanctions do not seem to have had a significant impact on Iran's oil exports, according to a recent report in the Turkish media.
Iran's oil minister, Zangane, has revealed that no country other than South Korea has stopped buying Iranian oil.
Both Zarif and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani believe that the purpose of a series of US actions is to "tempt" Iran to violate the agreement.
Zarif was also dismissive of a spate of verbal attacks by the US side, and when asked whether the US would overthrow the current Iranian government with increasing financial pressure, Zarif even laughed, "It is a strategy of regime change, which is the real purpose of the US side."

In addition, the tourism market series also includes the reform and opening up of the 40th anniversary of the chorus concert, the selection of old photos, and the public service exhibition of the large-scale monolithic art installation on both sides of the Straits in 2018.

Journalists have learned from the National Health Council that, compared with decades ago, the incidence of malnutrition among children and adolescents in China has decreased, while the incidence of overweight and obesity has increased significantly.
In this regard, experts point out that to maintain a healthy weight, the most important concept is to "cure the disease," and vigorously promote scientific fitness and a reasonable diet.
According to the Core Information and Interpretation of Youth Health Education in China (2018 version), recently released by the National Health Commission, the key to maintaining a healthy weight is a rational diet and scientific exercise.
Being overweight, obese and blindly losing weight are not good for health.
The health hidden danger behind the "small fat pier" cannot be ignored.
Ding Gang Qiang, director of the Institute of Nutrition and Health of the China Center for Disease Prevention and Control, said overweight obesity endangers the normal growth and development of young people, has a negative impact on their psychology, behavior, cognition and intelligence, and can even lead to high blood pressure, high blood sugar and high blood lipids in children.
At the same time, overweight obesity in adolescents is likely to continue into adulthood, which will increase the risk of chronic diseases such as high blood pressure and diabetes in adulthood.
Ding Gang Qiang said that tests on the nutritional and health status of Chinese residents in 2010-2012 showed that the rate of overweight among Chinese children aged 6-17 was 9.6 per cent and the rate of obesity was 6.4 per cent, which combined was 16 per cent.
At the same time, overweight obesity among children and adolescents is characterized by a higher number of boys than girls and a higher rate in urban areas than in rural areas, and the
How do teenagers cope with overweight obesity?
Zhang Li, deputy director of the Scientific Fitness and Health Promotion Research Center of the State Sports Administration, points out that the main causes of obesity in young people are excessive calorie intake and insufficient physical activity.
For this simple obesity, attention should be paid to scientific exercise combined with reasonable dietary control.
Zhang points out that to maintain a healthy weight, the most important concept is to "cure the disease." An important part of this is to provide all-round popular science education to schools, parents and students, popularize the dangers of overweight and obesity, and raise the awareness of prevention among young people.
Adolescents should conduct regular medical examinations, monitor growth and development indicators, such as height and weight, and detect and scientifically determine whether there is a problem of overweight and obesity at an early stage, so as to take timely intervention.
For young people who are already overweight and obese, Ding Gang suggested that, in addition to actively and scientifically arranging meals and exercise, young people are at a special physiological stage, should avoid the use of hunger or semi-hunger therapy to control and reduce their weight, and should not blindly take weight-loss drugs.

China News Agency, Yichang, October 1 (Guo Xiaoying Liu Min) The newly revised Traffic Control Regulations for the Three Gorges-Gezhouba Water Conservancy Hub (hereinafter referred to as the Movement Control Regulations) officially began to be implemented on October 1. After two years of trial navigation, the Three Gorges lift aircraft was officially unified with the ship lock.
On the first day of the implementation of the new regulations, the navigation order in the waters of the Three Gorges-Gezhouba is good.
The Yangtze River Three Gorges Navigation Authority issued its first security screening plan at 2100 hours on September 30, and carried out security checks on 160 ships, with a total of 124 vessels eligible for security checks.

The Movement Control Regulations add the principle of ship over-dam scheduling of "classification control," clarify the priority of overdam ships according to the functional positioning of the lock and lift, and adjust the short-term passenger ship over the gate to the same priority level as the demonstration ship and the integrity ship.
This is also two weeks after the pilot operation of the lift machine, the official unified dispatch with the lock.
For the first time, the Sichuan River and the Three Gorges Reservoir area large-scale demonstration vessels and new energy power vessels have also been placed in the priority class.
At the same time, the Movement Control Regulations adjust the "navigation dispatch management waters" from the previous 180 km of near-dam waters to 541.8 km of waters from the Yunyang Yangtze River Bridge to the Shiqiu Yangtze River Bridge, and divide the "core waters, near-dam waters, control waters and dispatch waters.
This will help the ship to choose the appropriate waters to wait for the gate, so as to reduce the backlog of ships waiting for the gate in the dam area.
In accordance with the characteristics of the overdam and waiting for the gate of the current ship, the Movement Control Regulations also put forward good faith measures such as cancellation of the declaration of the illegal ship and a delay of
After the Three Gorges water storage, the navigation conditions in the reservoir area have been improved, which has promoted the rapid development of shipping on the Yangtze River.

With the approval of Premier Li Keqiang, the State Council has recently issued the Decision on Further Pressure Reduction of the Catalogue for the Administration of Production Licences for Industrial Products and Simplification of the Approval and Approval Procedures.
The Decision proposes to further reduce the catalogue of production licenses for industrial products, eliminate the administration of production licenses for 14 categories of industrial products, and delegate the authority for the administration of production licenses for 4 types of industrial products to the quality and technical supervision departments of the people's governments at the provincial level.
As a result of this reform, the number of products subject to the administration of production licenses for industrial products will be reduced from 38 last year to the current 24.
The Decision makes it clear that there is a simplified approval procedure for the products in the catalogue.
The first is to change the pre-license product inspection organized by the license-issuing organ to the product inspection qualification report issued by the qualified inspection and testing institution submitted by the enterprise at the time of application.
Second, in addition to hazardous chemicals, the products licensed by the quality and technical supervision departments (market supervision and administration departments) of the people's governments at the provincial level shall be subject to on-site examination. After the enterprises submit the application and the product inspection qualification report and make a commitment to ensure the quality and safety of the products, they shall be able to obtain a production license after formal examination and then accept on-site examination within a specified period of time.
Third, in accordance with the principle of "one enterprise, one license," when applying for a new license or applying for a replacement license, the enterprise shall examine and issue a license for different types of products
The Decision requires that all regions and relevant departments should firmly push forward the catalogue of pressure reduction and the simplification of the examination and approval procedures.
We will strengthen the publicity of enterprises' commitments and post-on-the-spot examination, strengthen the means of credit supervision and restraint, carry out the responsibility of the main body of enterprise quality, and revoke production licenses for those who make false promises or fail to meet the requirements.
With regard to products that have abolished the management of production licenses for industrial products, it is necessary to effectively strengthen ex post facto supervision. Products related to public health and safety and environmental protection can be converted to compulsory certification, make a positive list and make it known to the public, harmonize certification standards, reasonably reduce and certify testing projects, and the cost of compulsory certification should, in principle, be borne by the financial system at all levels.
We will take support measures to encourage enterprises to carry out voluntary certification, promote the establishment of brands and expand the market.
We should standardize the international advanced standards and promote the improvement of the quality of industrial products.
Give full play to the role of third-party social organizations to ensure the quality and safety of industrial products.
For products that retain the management of production licenses for industrial products, it is necessary to improve the standard system, give full play to the advantages of industry supervision, strengthen the responsibility of "who approves and who supervises," dynamically assess the risks of product quality and safety, and reduce the catalogue, delegate the authority for examination and approval or convert to certification management at an appropriate time.
In September, China's comprehensive PMI ring ratio increased the PMI ring ratio in the manufacturing industry fell.
China's composite PMI output index stood at 54.1 per cent in September, up from 0.3 and 0.1 percentage points last month and the annual average, indicating that Chinese companies' production and business activities remained generally stable, according to data released by China
In the same month, the manufacturing production index and the non-manufacturing business activity index, which make up the composite PMI output index, were 53.0 per cent and 54.9 per cent, respectively, a drop of one litre.
Among them, China's manufacturing PMI was 50.8 per cent, down 0.5 percentage points.
Zhao Qinghe said the manufacturing PMI had five main characteristics this month:
First, the fundamentals of the manufacturing industry are generally stable.
Of the 21 industries surveyed, PMI in 14 industries was in the expansion range, of which PMI in manufacturing, such as medicine, specialized equipment and electrical and mechanical equipment, was at a higher operating level of more than 53.5 per cent, with a faster growth rate.
Second, there is a small fluctuation in supply and demand.
The production index and the new order index were 53.0 per cent and 52.0 per cent, respectively, down 0.3 and 0.2 percentage points from the previous month. Supply and demand remained buoyant, but the expansion slowed slightly.
The new export order index and the import index were 48.0 per cent and 48.5 per cent, respectively, down from 1.4 and 0.6 percentage points last month, with the boom falling to a year-low.
The fourth is the increase in the cost of purchasing raw materials.
The purchase price index for major raw materials was 59.8 per cent, up 1.1 percentage points from the previous month, and the ex-factory price index was 54.3 per cent, the same level as the previous month, both year-on-year highs.
Fifth, the operation of large enterprises is sound, and the operating conditions of small enterprises continue to improve.
With a PMI of 52.1 per cent, the same level as last month, the index has been in the expansion range of 52.0 per cent and above so far this year, and both the production index and the new order index have increased this month, which is the main driver of manufacturing expansion; the PMI of medium-sized enterprises is 48.7 per cent, down from 1.7 percentage points last month, in the contraction range; and the PMI of small enterprises is 50.4 per cent, up from 0.4 percentage points last month, up for two consecutive months.
In the same month, China's index of non-manufacturing business activity stood at 54.9 per cent, up 0.7 percentage points from the previous month and rebounding for two consecutive months.
Zhao Qinghe believes that the non-manufacturing industry as a whole continues to maintain a steady and positive development momentum.
The index of business activity in the road transport, securities, real estate and other industries continues to be below the tipping point, and the total volume of business has been reduced.
Nagoya (Reuters) - Bank of Japan President Haruhiko Kuroda said Monday that the central bank is aware that the long-term implementation of ultra-easy monetary policy could squeeze financial institutions' profit margins and could destabilize the country's banking system.
But he said the Bank of Japan needed to maintain its massive stimulus package, while keeping a close eye on the pros and cons of its policies, given low inflation and uncertainty in overseas economies.
"The Bank of Japan fully acknowledges that under continued monetary easing, the strength of financial institutions will be increasingly affected," Haruhiko Kuroda said in a speech to business leaders in Nagoya.
If financial institutions are more active in taking risks to compensate for the narrowing of profit margins caused by years of low interest rates, there is a risk of instability in the banking system in the event of a serious negative shock, he said.
"Although these risks are not significant at the moment, the central bank will pay close attention to the situation and encourage financial institutions to take the necessary measures," he said.
The minutes of the Bank of Japan's meeting, released earlier on Monday, showed that the Bank of Japan's policy committee discussed the rising cost of long-term easing at an interest-rate meeting in September.
If the economy continues to expand, "the Bank of Japan will have more room for flexibility in policy in the future," according to the minutes of the meeting.
According to the minutes of the meeting, another member said that, given the limitations of the duration of the policy, the committee should discuss how long the Bank of Japan could maintain the stimulus.
Haruhiko Kuroda said the Bank of Japan would assess the financial risks posed by easing, while also taking into account the uncertainty surrounding Japan's economic outlook, which could affect global demand as a result of trade friction between China and the United States and rising protectionism.
"The impact of such problems on the Japanese economy is limited for the time being," Haruhiko Kuroda said.
"But how the problem persists, the impact on the Japanese economy is likely to grow larger," he added.
"There is a need for continued strong monetary easing, while considering both positive and negative effects in a balanced manner," Haruhiko Kuroda said.
While the shortcomings of the aggressive stimulus program have increased, such as long-term low interest rates eroding the profits of financial institutions, low inflation has forced the Bank of Japan to maintain the program.
The Bank of Japan maintained monetary policy last month; Haruhiko Kuroda ruled out a recent interest-rate hike in the face of the risks posed by disputes over the global trade war.
Corporate logos on Tesla electric cars, Cardiff, United States, June 1, 2018.
Under a settlement agreement, U.S. Tesla Motors and its executive director, Musk, have agreed to each pay a $20 million fine to financial regulators, and Musk will also resign as chairman of the company but remain CEO.
The settlement would put an end to Tesla's turmoil, which lasted for two months.
Investors will be relieved by the settlement of securities fraud charges disclosed by the Securities and Exchange Commission on Saturday.
Investors had feared that the protracted legal battle would only further hit the electric car company, which is still losing money.
The SEC sued Musk on Thursday for fraud, saying its August 7 tweets misled investors.
He is considering privatizing Tesla for $420 a share and has secured financing, the tweets said.
The SEC said the tweets were in fact unfounded and that the market turmoil they triggered hurt investors.
Investors and corporate governance experts say the deal could strengthen Tesla, which has been hit hard by Musk's recent behavior.
Steven Heim, head of asset management at Boston Common, said the settlement should put Musk under more scrutiny, while failing to take "devastating" measures to drive him out of Tesla.
The asset management company holds shares in Tesla's battery maker Panasonic.
Under the proposed agreement, Tesla would have to appoint an independent chairman, two independent directors and a board of directors to develop controls on Musk's external communications.
"It is in the best interests of our market and our investors, including Tesla shareholders, for the matter to be resolved quickly on agreed terms," SEC Chairman Clayton said in a statement.
Thursday's allegations caused Tesla's market value to evaporate by about $7 billion, and the company's market value stood at $45.2 billion on Friday, down from GM's $47.5 billion.
In the settlement, the SEC withdrew its request to oust Musk from the position of head of the company.
Many investors said the penalty would be catastrophic.
"I think it's the best possible outcome for all involved," said Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial Partners, who gave Tesla a "neutral" rating and called the SEC penalty a "light penalty" for Musk.
"His remaining as CEO is important to Tesla," he said.
Neither Musk nor Tesla acknowledged or denied the SEC's allegations in the settlement, and did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The settlement agreement still needs to be approved by the court.
Beijing Morning News (journalist Wang Ping) The Beijing Morning News has learned from the Beijing Construction Industry Group that one of the core buildings of the Beijing World Garden Association Park in 2019, the Beijing World Garden Association Performing Arts Square project, will adopt a multi-color ETFE jigsaw membrane structure for the first time, the 5440-square-meter membrane structure will show six colors of dark red, dark green, orange, blue, red and green, and the shape of a "butterfly wing" under the Zhang pull of the Lasso steel winch.
According to Liu Changbao, project director of the Beijing Construction Industry Five Construction Group, the performing arts square project has a floor area of 4,500 square meters, with a total installed capacity of 1,182 tons of steel. The roof of the steel structure is supported by a suspension steel truss of 26 paratroopers, and presents the shape of a "butterfly wing" under the Zhang pull of the cable steel winch line.
"Overlooking the performing arts square from the air, the colorful roof is like a fluttering butterfly, and the bright colors will not fade over time and wind, rain and snow."
Previously, the monochrome ETFE membrane structure has been widely used in the Bird's Nest, Water Cube and other projects, but the multi-color jigsaw ETFE membrane structure is still the first in the country.
The reporter learned that because there are very few suppliers with the production capacity of a variety of color membrane structures around the world, every inch of membrane structure material is very "precious."
Liu Changbao said that in order to avoid problems such as overlapping and "fighting" at the end of the cable, it will also innovate to adopt a "double fork ear" cable head structure to ensure that the cable head of the "fight" is in the right place through a special fixed plug-in.
At present, the construction of the Beijing World Park Park in 2019 is under way.
Among them, the international pavilion project has completed all the "flower umbrella" hoisting construction.
The planned project will be ready for deployment at the end of October.

After more than 5,000 years of hardship, China is still there!
Looking to the future, China will always be here!

The death toll from Indonesia's strong earthquake and tsunami has risen to 420, and there have been no reports of casualties among Chinese citizens
The death toll from the powerful earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia's Central Sulawesi province has risen to 420, Indonesia's official Antala news agency said at midnight local time, citing figures released by the head of the country's disaster response agency, Wilem Rampangilei.
The official said it was only a statistic for the city of Palu, the capital of Central Sulawesi province, excluding the district of Dongara, where the epicenter was located, and the nearby region of Sigi, where communications are still disrupted and the number of people killed has not yet been reported.
Because many roads in the city of Palu have been severely damaged, heavy machinery is difficult to access, and search and rescue efforts have been very difficult.
In order to safeguard the rescue, the Palu airport, which began to close on the 28th night, was closed on all commercial flights after it reopened on the 29th night, and the flight from Jakarta to Palu, which had been completed that night
After the earthquake and tsunami, the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia learned through various channels to verify the situation of Chinese citizens in the disaster area.

"The supersonic project is being carried out in accordance with the plan of the international group and the contract signed with the Ministry of Industry and Trade," said Seiparo, president of the Central Institute of Air Fluid Dynamics in Zhukovsky, Russia.
We believe that it will take two to three years to carry out the technical demonstration, and another 10 to 15 years to achieve mass production of civil aircraft.
The current problem for Russian scientists is how to strike a balance between the economy and safety of the aircraft, SeiPalo said.
He said the supersonic plane was characterised by a huge noise impact.
The institute is working with the Moscow Institute of Aviation and the Tupolev Design Bureau to develop a full range of civil supersonic aircraft, including business and large passenger aircraft for commercial transport, Mr Seiparo said.
Secretary-General Xi Jinping delivered a very important speech at the symposium on private enterprises, injecting firm confidence in the direction of the private economy to a broader stage.
Secretary-General Xi Jinping's emphasis on "letting entrepreneurs unload their ideological baggage and move forward lightly" resonates strongly among a wide range of entrepreneurs and innovative entrepreneurs.
The vitality of the market comes from people, especially entrepreneurs, and from entrepreneurship.
In the magnificent course of 40 years of reform and opening up, there are thousands of stories of entrepreneurial innovation, the growth and growth of the group of entrepreneurs, and continue to push forward the breaking waves of the Chinese economy.
For some time, some people in society have made some negative and skeptical remarks about the private economy.
Misstatements such as the so-called "off-the-field theory of the private economy" and the "new public-private partnership theory" have aroused the doubts and concerns of some entrepreneurs.
Recently, some private enterprises have encountered a lot of difficulties and problems in their business development.
For example, changes in the international economic environment have had an impact on some export enterprises; rapid adjustment of the demand structure has put pressure on transformation and upgrading; some policies are not coordinated, the policy effects are superimposed, or the working methods are simple, leading to the opposite effect of some policies that were originally intended to be good.
A variety of factors are intertwined, the private economy has encountered difficulties, the operation of some private enterprises is facing difficulties, and entrepreneurs show a lot of anxiety
Against this background, it is of particularly profound practical significance to correct the misconceptions of understanding, unload the ideological baggage of entrepreneurs, let enterprises concentrate on development, and the government focus on development, which has a bearing on market confidence and development expectations.
The symposium once again stressed the important assertion that "three have not changed": "The status and role of the non-public sector of the economy in the economic and social development of our country has not changed!"
From the in-depth promotion of decentralization and the establishment of a power list system to the creation of a rule-of-law environment to protect the legitimate rights and interests of entrepreneurs, the creation of a fair and competitive market environment, and the shaping of an atmosphere of respect for entrepreneurs in the whole society, the Party Central Committee has attached unprecedented importance to entrepreneurs and the strength of institutional safeguards in recent years.
The symposium also clearly put forward the policy measures to vigorously support the development and growth of private enterprises in six areas, and launched a series of practical actions aimed at the "light forward" of private enterprises.
These are very encouraging to the group of entrepreneurs and give more expectations to all sectors of the society.
The fog is broken, the guidelines are set, and the key is to implement them.
We should continue to create a better environment for the development of the private economy, help private enterprises to solve the difficulties in development, and contribute to the transformation and upgrading of China's economy. We should make entrepreneurs feel fair in market competition, feel safe in legitimate business operations, feel respect in social life, stimulate the vitality of innovation and create potential.
As China's economy moves into a process of high-quality development, it needs more entrepreneurs to express their aspirations. It also provides more space and stage for entrepreneurs to develop their creativity.
We have reason to believe that, with the further deepening of reform and the elimination of obstacles, the private economy will usher in better development prospects and development opportunities and move to a broader stage.
On-line verification of all 46 supervision certificates in the import and export links of Inner Mongolia - China New Network
With immediate effect, all 46 regulatory certificates in the local import and export links will be subject to on-line verification, in addition to special circumstances such as the need for confidentiality, Hohhot Customs said on November 5.
Enterprises in Inner Mongolia can declare the relevant documents to the Customs in a paperless manner, so as to avoid the problems of on-the-spot travel, paper application, repeated submission, etc.
It is understood that the document preparation time refers to the preparation time for the various types of documents required for the import and export links prior to the declaration of customs declaration. It is a major factor affecting the overall clearance time. In order to compress the clearance time and reduce the customs clearance cost, the document must be reduced.
Previously, there were 86 types of regulatory documents that required customs inspection in the import and export links, involving 19 departments.
It is reported that this time, in accordance with the principle of "can cancel, can merge, can withdraw from port inspection," relying on the "single window" platform of international trade, customs docking and data interconnection with the system of 16 other license-issuing organs, so as to achieve more data running roads and less running errands for enterprises.
The customs said that in the past, enterprises had to go back and forth to and from the on-site office hall of the relevant departments to submit paper applications, the process was long and could not track the status of the audit in real time.
Now enterprise users can log in directly to the "single window" portal for on-line application.
After the examination and approval of the license-issuing department, the electronic data of the certificate is transmitted to the Customs, and the automatic comparison and intelligent verification of the customs declaration data is realized in the customs clearance link. The results of the examination are uniformly fed back to the enterprises through the "single window," so as to realize the full-process online processing of the declaration, verification, customs clearance and feedback of the regulatory documents.
Han Sheng Chicken Soup exports to China have surged 20-fold in four years or related to the increase in the number of empty nests - China
Analysis of the 20-fold increase in the export of Han Sheng Chicken Soup to China over the past four years: Related to the increase in the number of empty-nested young people
South Korean chicken soup exported more than $100,000 to China last year, up about 20 times from 2013 four years ago, the ROK reported on Friday.
The analysis suggests that this increase is related to the increase in the number of young people in empty nests in China to drive the hot sale of convenient food, as well as the increase in the attention of young people to nutritious food.
The data was published by the Korea Agro-Aquatic Food Circulation Commune (aT) on May 5.
South Korean ginseng chicken soup exported $103.39 million to China last year, weighing 218.59 million kg, a jump of 2,094 per cent and 3,668.8 per cent, respectively, from 2013.
The analysis concluded that the increase in the sale of South Korean chicken soup in China is related to the increase in the number of empty nest youth to promote the hot sale of convenient food, as well as the increase in the attention of young people to nutritious food.
By the end of this year, one-person households in China had passed the 200 million mark, which is expected to increase to 30 per cent of the total population by 2020, and local food companies have launched a variety of convenient food products aimed at the "single rice people."
In addition, the analysis also said that bird flu is the biggest factor preventing chicken soup from taking root in the mainland Chinese market.
There was an outbreak of bird flu in South Korea from November 2016 to April last year, and authorities imposed a total ban on the export of ginseng chicken soup to China, leading to a sharp drop in exports, aT said.
Exports of ginseng chicken soup to China reached $840,000 in 2016, and plummeted to $100,000 last year due to bird flu.

The US State Department then said Secretary of State Pompeo would visit North Korea in October to promote the implementation of the promise of a meeting between US and North Korean leaders in Singapore.
Since the beginning of this year, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have broken the ice to open the path of dialogue, the leaders of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the United States have held meetings, the general trend of de-escalation on the peninsula has continued, and the principle of dialogue to resolve the issue on the peninsula has been upheld.
First, there has been no change in the fact that "the essence of the peninsula issue is a security issue." The key to achieving peace on the peninsula is to address the legitimate security concerns of all parties in a proper and balanced manner, rather than simply putting pressure on each other and stressing their own claims.
Second, in the dialogue on the denuclearization of the peninsula, the parties concerned are still divided on the steps and modalities for the denuclearization of the peninsula, and the game thinking of "who comes first" remains strong due to the long-standing lack of political trust between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the United States.
At a recent public meeting of the Security Council on the Korean peninsula at United Nations Headquarters in New York, different voices around the issue of sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have once again highlighted the "no change" on the Korean peninsula.
Us Secretary of State Pompeo has insisted that sanctions against North Korea will not be lifted until the Korean peninsula is fully denuclearized.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, for his part, stressed the principle of "responding to action with action," noting that "the weakening trend of sanctions should be in step with the steps taken by North Korea on the road to a gradual abandonment of nuclear weapons."
There is no doubt that the parties concerned should continue to implement the Security Council resolutions related to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in a comprehensive, complete and accurate manner, but pressure is not an end, and the implementation of sanctions and the promotion of a political settlement are requirements of the Council's resolutions, both of which cannot be ignored and cannot be chosen only.
As Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, in view of the current positive developments in inter-Korean and inter-Korean relations, China believes that it is necessary for the Security Council to consider the timely activation of reversible clauses, so as to encourage North Korea and all parties concerned to take greater steps towards denuclearization.
Looking back, the denuclearization of the peninsula and every progress in the peace process will require sufficient political courage on all sides.
At present, in the face of the growing expectations of the international community to promote a political solution to the problem of the peninsula, the parties concerned should, in particular, demonstrate political courage, make political decisions, implement their commitments, resolve difficult problems, continue to take steps towards each other, push forward the process of denuclearization of the peninsula and establish a peace mechanism on the peninsula, so as to jointly create a permanent peace on the peninsula.
The People's Government of Ji County, Linfen City, Shanxi Province, reported that during the National Day, the Hukou Falls scenic area of the Yellow River, which is located in the county, will maintain relatively high water levels and do not meet the conditions for opening up.
In order to ensure safety, the scenic area was temporarily closed during the National Day.

According to reporters, June-October of each year is the flood season of the Yellow River, starting from July 12, 2018, due to the high water level of the Yellow River, the Hukou scenic area of the Yellow River in Shanxi Province has been closed for nearly a month.
Ni Yufeng, chief engineer of the Hukou Scenic Area Management Committee, told the media that this is the longest extension of the high water level of the Yellow River in the past 20 years. "It has not been closed for so long, our flood season closed for four days in 2017, and this year is nearly a month."
It is understood that the Hukou Falls scenic area of the Yellow River in Shanxi Province, originally in preparation for the "11" Golden Week, has also increased personnel arrangements in advance, vehicle maintenance, and even the hiring of temporary staff.
According to the Circular on Doing a Good Job in Flood Control in the Yellow River during the National Day, issued by the "Ming telegram of the Office of the General Command of Flood Control and Drought Control in the Yellow River," Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan and Shandong provinces are required to do a good job in flood control in the Yellow River during the

Provision of Influenza Vaccination Service in Health Centres and Health Stations, especially during the National Day Holidays
The Health Bureau has ordered 150,000 doses of the four-price influenza vaccine for 2018-2019 this year. At this stage, priority is given to free vaccination for high-risk people. In order to facilitate the vaccination of influenza during the holidays, the health centres and health stations under the Health Bureau provide vaccination services from 9 a.m. to 1 noon during the National Day holiday (1 and 2 October).
In addition to the above-mentioned convenience measures, the health centres and health stations under the Health Bureau have extended their influenza vaccination service from Monday to Friday to 8 p.m. since the launch of the programme. As at 4 p.m. on 30 September, 4,158 people had been vaccinated, up from 3,714 in the same period last year.
Free vaccinations are provided to the following Macao residents: Persons aged between 6 months and under 18 years, persons aged 50 years and over, pregnant women, all persons suffering from chronic diseases, including obese persons (i.e. persons with a body mass index of 30 or above), as well as staff of institutions, nurseries, kindergartens, primary schools and secondary schools, all health workers, and Macao residents working in betting and entertainment venues.
At the same time, other persons, including the public sector, who are deemed necessary by the Health Bureau, will take the initiative to contact the relevant agencies to obtain the list and arrange for the vaccination by the Health Centre.
To facilitate vaccinators and reduce the waiting time for vaccination, the HB will send medical staff to secondary schools, primary schools, kindergartens and nurseries in Hong Kong from October to December this year to collectively vaccinate young children, primary and secondary school students, teachers and staff. In addition, the HB will arrange group vaccinations for elderly people and institutions with disabilities, a large number of public departments or other institutions, etc
Students and young children who are unable to take part in the group vaccination may be vaccinated at the inoculation station or health centre of the Earl of Yan General Hospital with a Macao resident identity card, user card of the Health Bureau, influenza vaccination card (if any), student ID card, staff card or professional certificate from 3 December 2018.
The Health Bureau reminded residents that between September 2017 and August 2018, people who had been vaccinated against influenza from 2017 to 2018 would still need to receive a new season of influenza vaccine from September 2018, as the influenza antigen component contained in the influenza vaccine in the northern hemisphere in 2018-2019 had been updated to target seasonal influenza in the northern hemisphere in the winter of 2018-2019 and the summer of 2019.
The peak flu season in Macao usually occurs from January to March of each year, later than in temperate regions (such as northern China and Japan). The Health Bureau calls on the elderly, children, pregnant women, obese people and people with chronic diseases who are at high risk of complications after contracting influenza, as well as those who are in regular contact with high-risk people, to be vaccinated as soon as possible.

On the evening of September 29, the reporter was informed by the Propaganda Department of the QingBaijiang District Committee in Chengdu that on the evening of September 29, Beijing time, a Central European Brow (Chengdu), loaded with goods such as car connectors, telescopes and liquid crystal display screens, was changed through the port of Shemianufka, Poland, and finally arrived in Nuremberg, Germany.
This is the first time that the Central European Brow has opened the Polish port line of Shemianufka, marking the successful opening of another European transport line after Mara and Chopp.
The Central European class, which started on September 14 at the QingBaijiang City Station in Chengdu, left through the Ala Pass and entered Europe via the port of Shemianufka, Poland, and eventually reached Nuremberg, Germany, for a total of about 16 days.
For the first time, the Central European class row is carried out here to carry out the shift operation of the class wide rail and the standard rail.

More than 400 people have been confirmed dead in a 7.5-magnitude earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday, many of whom were swept away by tsunami waves triggered by the earthquake.
Authorities expect a significant increase in the total number of deaths on Sunday as new figures are reported in remote areas.
Dozens of people are reportedly still trapped under the rubble of a hotel and a shopping mall in the city of Baru.
Large waves of up to six meters (20 feet) triggered by the earthquake hit the city of Baru.
So far, there have been only deaths from Baru, the death toll in Dongra, north of Baru, has been slow to report and authorities are preparing for a worse situation.
Dongra, with a population of 300,000, is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Indonesia's Vice President Kara said the total number of deaths could rise to thousands.
As the dusk waves hit the coast on Friday, hundreds of people gathered on the beach to celebrate the holiday, many were swept away by the waves, and everything was destroyed wherever the waves went.
Tokyo (Reuters) - The confidence of Japan's large manufacturers hit its lowest level in more than a year in the September quarter, as companies felt pressure from rising raw material costs and a series of natural disasters that affected production, according to a quarterly survey released by the Bank of Japan on Monday.
The survey shows little evidence that escalating global trade friction has hit the confidence of large manufacturers.
But the risk of a full-blown trade war has hit business prospects and could threaten corporate capital spending.
Active capital spending is a bright spot in Japan's economy.
The survey calls into question the Bank of Japan's view that a robust economic expansion would help drive inflation to accelerate to the 2% target, despite signs that companies are gradually passing on costs to customers.
"Amid concerns about the global trade war, confidence among manufacturers tends to stagnate due to slowing exports and weak factory production," said Nan Wuzhi, chief research fellow at the Institute of General Cooperation in Agriculture and Forestry.
"Confidence is still high, and because corporate profits are improving and prices are rising, I don't think confidence will continue to decline," he said
The short-term survey showed that the large manufacturing boom judgment index fell to a positive 19 in September, from a positive 21 three months ago, worsening for the third consecutive quarter.
The median estimate for the market is positive 22.
The large non-manufacturing boom judgment index fell to a positive 22 in September, from a positive 24 in June, for the first time in eight quarters.
The Reuters survey was positive 22.
The survey showed that both large-scale manufacturing and non-manufacturing business judgment indices were expected to remain stable in December.
Investors were unconcerned about the decline in the short-view business sentiment index, with the Nikkei index. N225 rising to a 27-year high on Monday as the continued depreciation of the yen helped improve the export earnings prospects of Japanese companies.
Capital expenditure is robust.
Despite the decline in business confidence, the latest short view highlights the robustness of corporate capital spending plans, helped by renewed capacity and increased investment in robotics and automation to cope with labor shortages caused by an aging population.
The central bank's short-view survey shows that large companies plan to increase their capital spending by 13.4 per cent in the current fiscal year ending March 2019.
The previous short-view survey was 13.6 per cent.
Mr Nan said all corporate capital spending plans for the current fiscal year grew by 8.5 per cent, close to the pace of Japan's bubble economy.
"Given that small businesses have raised their profit estimates from now on, there is still room for further growth in capital spending, but much depends on the impact of the trade war on business confidence," he said.
The short-view survey showed an increase in the ability of companies to pass on costs, with the output price index of large companies at a positive 7, a 10-year high, an encouraging sign of progress in Japan's efforts to combat deflation.
The index measuring the employment situation of large enterprises hit minus 23, the most tight level since 1992, highlighting the tightening of the job market.
Benefiting from robust corporate spending, Japan's economy rebounded in the second quarter from a contraction in January-March this year.
But the escalation of trade friction in the summer and the disruption of the supply chain by natural disasters have cast a shadow over the outlook for Japan's export-dependent economy.
In dollar terms, the growth rate of service imports and exports is 16.4 per cent.
The total import and export of emerging services exceeded 1 trillion yuan from January to August, faster than the overall growth rate, according to a press release on the website of the Ministry of Commerce, citing the head of the Division of Services and Trade.
Among them, the total import and export of emerging services was 1,138.39 billion yuan, an increase of 20.9 per cent, which was higher than the overall growth rate of services imports and exports by 10.4 percentage points, leading to an increase of nearly 3 percentage points in the share of emerging services.
In terms of services exports, from January to August, services exports continued their rapid growth momentum so far this year, with exports growing 5.7 percentage points faster than imports.
Among them, the top three areas of growth were telecommunications computer and information services, personal cultural and entertainment services, and insurance services, with growth rates of 61.1 per cent, 38.8 per cent and 26.5 per cent, respectively.
The head of the Division also pointed out that the share of imports of emerging services had also increased gradually from January to August.
From January to August, imports of emerging services grew rapidly, accounting for 23.6 per cent of services imports, an increase of 1.6 percentage points over the same period last year.
Among them, imports of financial services, intellectual property royalties, telecommunications computers and information services all grew by more than 20 per cent, at 47.1 per cent, 23.3 per cent and 23.2 per cent, respectively.

Opening of the 69th International Astronautical Congress in Germany - China New Network
The 69th International Astronautical Congress opened on October 1 at the Bremen Convention and Exhibition Center in Bremen, Germany, with the participation of more than 6,300 astronauts, representatives of space agencies and enterprises, experts, scholars and young students from all over the world.
In a speech at the opening ceremony, the President of the International Astronautical Federation, Jean-Yves Legar, said that the global space industry was no longer attended by only a few countries and institutions, and that there had been a significant increase in the number of participants this year compared with the previous session, indicating that more and more institutions and people were joining.
He called on all countries to strengthen cooperation and innovation and jointly promote the development of the space industry.
Speaking at the exchange event, Zhang Kejian, Deputy Minister of Industry and Informatization of China and Director of the National Space Administration, introduced China's space program and said China would expand international cooperation in the field of space and contribute to the cause of human space.
Representatives of relevant institutions, such as the China Aerospace Science and Technology Group Corporation and the China Aerospace Science and Industry Group Corporation, as well as some private enterprises, showed the latest achievements in China's space, including various launch vehicles, satellites and space science and technology applications.

Beijing (Reuters) - The Canton Fair shows that China's foreign trade situation remains complex and severe, with 80.6 per cent of companies expecting exports to be better or flat in 2018, according to a press release issued by the China Foreign Trade Center on Sunday.
However, taking into account the external environment in which the cost of comprehensive factors such as domestic raw materials and labor continues to rise, and the impact of trade friction between China and the United States has increased, exhibitors also believe that the export situation next year is not optimistic.
At the closing press conference of the 124th Canton Fair, Xu Bing, deputy secretary-general, press spokesman and deputy director of the China Foreign Trade Center, said the number of overseas buyers and export transactions at the Canton Fair had fallen slightly year-on-year.
The number of buyers was 189,812, from 215 countries and regions, down 1.11 per cent year-on-year.
Export transactions amounted to 206.494 billion yuan (equivalent to $29.86 billion), a year-on-year decrease of 1 per cent.
In terms of the market, transactions with Japan, the 10 ASEAN countries, the BRIC countries and South Korea grew by 74.4 per cent, 11.4 per cent, 7.2 per cent and 2.5 per cent, respectively, while traditional markets such as the United States, Australia, Canada and the European Union fell by 30.3 per cent, 8.9 per cent, 7.3 per cent and 0.8 per cent, respectively.
In terms of industry, means of transport, machinery and equipment, construction and decorative materials, electronic consumer goods and information products, and bathroom equipment increased by 24.8 per cent, 21.1 per cent, 20.0 per cent, 15.1 per cent and 7.6 per cent, respectively, while textile and clothing and household appliances decreased by 13.0 per cent and 6.7 per cent, respectively.
Xu said that, as a barometer and wind vane of China's foreign trade, the attendance of buyers at the Canton Fair and the data on export transactions show that China's foreign trade development will still face a lot of uncertainty and instability next year.
However, with the deepening of supply-side structural reforms and the recent introduction of policies and measures such as "six stability" at the national and local levels, the new momentum of China's foreign trade development is gathering faster, and new progress has been made in the diversification of the enterprise market. These are important foundations and strong conditions for the development of foreign trade.
"Taking into account all factors, it is expected that China's foreign trade imports and exports will continue to grow steadily throughout the year, with further improvement in quality and efficiency," Xu said.
China's General Administration of Customs has reported a year-on-year increase of 14.5 per cent in US dollar-denominated exports in September, a year-on-year increase of 14.3 per cent in imports, a trade surplus of $316.90 billion in September, and the highest export growth rate and trade surplus since February this year.
Despite the escalating trade friction between China and the US, China's export performance in September was much higher than expected, with exuberant external demand, the superimposed depreciation of the renminbi's exchange rate by companies before the imposition of tariffs in the United States, or major supporting factors, also partly demonstrating the resilience of China's foreign trade, but the impact of the China-US trade war on confidence and the impact on the industrial chain should not be underestimated, and analysts believe that the challenges of China's foreign trade are likely to emerge in the fourth quarter or next year.
U.S. fund managers recommended an increase in cash holdings in September and continued to take a cautious stance, as the United States and China began the latest round of mutual import tariffs and there was no sign of easing the dispute, according to a Reuters survey.
But North American asset allocation rose to its highest since June 2017, while positions in the United Kingdom, the eurozone, and emerging markets in particular fell, according to 12 fund managers involved in the survey.
The global share allocation averaged 56.6 per cent for equities and 35.5 per cent for bonds, largely in line with the survey last month.
The most significant change was the increase in the cash ratio to 5.1 per cent, the highest since December 2014.
"Some economic data has brought confidence to the market, but the trade war is still the biggest concern, so it's better to be prepared to enter when the market falls back," said a fund manager at a large fund company.
But fund managers continued to prefer stocks, especially in the United States, in September, even if US stocks were considered to be high.
Today, in Shanghai, China's open landmark, the world's first large-scale import-themed national exhibition, the China International Import Expo, was officially opened in public expectation.
An exhibition is like a "window" that will give the world a better understanding of a city and a country.
Through the Expo this "window," people see to move to a higher level of "open China"; with the help of the Expo this "window," welcome the world and "reform and opening up again" China's mutual benefit and win-win win-win.
"For a country, openness is like a cocoon into a butterfly, although it will experience a moment of pain, but it will lead to a new life."
Secretary-General Xi Jinping's summary of the road to opening up points out an important reason for "why China can."
Looking back over the 40 years of reform and opening up, China, which has dared to enter the vast sea of the world market, has encountered whirlpools and waves, but has always faced all risk challenges with an open attitude, constantly unleashing endogenous momentum and constantly improving its ability to compete.
It can be said that China has made a strong interpretation of the value and significance of opening up with its own practical achievements.
Standing at a new historical starting point, the holding of an import-themed fair is a major decision made by the Party Central Committee, with Comrade Xi at its core, with a view to promoting a new round of high-level opening to the outside world. It is a major initiative by China to open its markets to the world. It is China's practical action in support of economic globalization and trade liberalization, demonstrating the strong and clear will that "China's open door will not be closed, but will only grow larger."
And the high number of exhibitors from all over the world, "one difficult position," is the biggest affirmation and the best response to China's development of an open economy on a larger scale, in a wider field and at a deeper level.
More importantly, the current global economic and trade order has reached a crossroads.
Some countries have built walls of trade protectionism and retreated to the old path of unilateralism, adding to the international community's concerns about the prospects for free trade and adding a lot of uncertainty to a warming world economy.
Against the background of such an era, the event on the banks of the Huangpu River reflects China's defense of free trade, allowing the world to see open markets and share the future of China's self-confidence and China's
Go alone fast, and all the people go far.
By opening its mind and embracing the world, China has not only vigorously promoted its own development, but also brought surging "Chinese opportunities" to all countries and regions of the world.
In recent years, China has advocated and promoted the construction of the "Belt and Road," launched the establishment of the AIIB, and set up the Silk Road Fund... China has provided a series of international public goods, provided real export markets, development opportunities and jobs, and allowed enterprises from all countries to take a ride on China's development "express train."
The Expo is also such a public product, a big platform for global economic and trade cooperation.
On top of this platform, more than 3,000 enterprises in more than 130 countries and regions have made a new step in the Chinese market with a variety of high-quality products and services.
In addition to enterprises in various countries, there are also domestic consumers who really benefit.
By setting up this "optimization and improvement" platform, it provides a multi-channel high-quality supply for the upgrading of consumption, so as to meet the individualized, diversified and differentiated consumption needs of the people.
With the opening of China's open door, the flow of goods, the use of everything, the step towards a better life will be more solid.

Foreign media: The United States and Canada have reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The agreement includes Canada's opening of its dairy market to the United States and the temporary non-imposition by the United States of additional tariffs on Canadian-made cars.
A Canadian source said on the evening of September 30 that the United States and Canada had reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement, foreign media reported.
It was revealed that the agreement included Canada's opening of its dairy market to the United States and the temporary non-imposition of additional tariffs by the United States on Canadian-made cars.
On July 27, the United States and Mexico announced a preliminary agreement in principle on the renewal of the North American Free Trade Agreement, but the United States and Canada failed to reach an agreement by the August 31 deadline set by the United States to extend the negotiations until September 30.
Previously, a spokesman for Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland said Canada would only sign a favourable agreement, "focusing on substance rather than timetable, and we will continue to consult in the hope of reaching an agreement that is in Canada's national interest."
More than 90 per cent of Brazilian women voters said the presidential candidates did not take into account the needs of women.
According to data recently released by the Brazilian National Geographic Institute (IBGE), more than 90 per cent of Brazilian women do not believe that presidential candidates take into account the needs of women, the Network of Expatriates of South America reported.
At present, the number of women in Brazil has reached 107 million, and if women from all over Brazil are brought together to form a country, the country will be ranked 13th in the world, more than two times the population of Spain, the report said.
In Brazil, women accounted for 52 per cent of the total electorate and 48 per cent of men, and although the proportion of women in the electorate was very high, women accounted for only 10 per cent of the country's Congress.
Of the 193 countries in the world, Brazilian women are ranked only 154th in terms of political participation, higher than in the Arab countries.
After more than 20 years of struggle for rights, Brazilian women still do not succeed in obtaining the rights they deserve.
Natalia Mori, a Brazilian sociologist, points out that the reason for this phenomenon lies in the combined effect of ancient patrilineal societies, racism, and capitalist values.
"Politics is supposed to be a society in which citizens claim civil rights, identity, access to public goods, and multiple social groups, but Brazilian politics is the monopoly of one group, and the majority of the population is not represented."
A previous study by the Brazilian Institute of Locomotiva also noted that 94 per cent of Brazilian women did not feel that elected politicians were able to represent their rights, 90 per cent disagreed with the decisions made by politicians and 93 per cent disagreed with the current government's policy of governance.
"We need to reverse the under-representation of women in parliament, and Brazil's political system is still affected by inequality. So far, there is still serious gender, class, and racial discrimination in Brazil's political sphere," Natalia Mori said.
Despite the lack of women's rights, most Brazilian women still believe in the power of democracy.
According to the survey, 76 per cent of women believe they can make a difference in democratic elections, and 72 per cent are interested in politics.
In addition, 55 per cent of women believe that democratic politics is the best way for women to suffer less prejudice.
China new net Astana October 1 (journalist Wen Longjie) The Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan held a solemn flag-raising ceremony on October 1 to welcome the birthday of New China at the age of 69.
More than 80 representatives of all librarians of the Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan, news agencies in Kazakhstan, financial institutions, Chinese enterprises, overseas Chinese, Confucius Institutes and international students took part in the event.
On October 1, the Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan held a flag-raising ceremony to welcome the birthday of New China at the age of 69.
After the flag-raising ceremony, Zhang xiao, Ambassador of China to Ha, said that on the occasion of the 69th birthday of the great motherland, we held a solemn flag-raising ceremony in a foreign country, which was a profound patriotic educational event.
Although we have been living abroad for a long time, we always have a great heart to the motherland.
'today, more than ever, the Chinese nation is closer to the great goal of national rejuvenation and closer than ever to the center of the world stage, 'Mr. Zhang said.
"Our mission, our responsibilities and our work are more honorable, arduous and heavy than ever before."
Zhang stressed that we should not forget the first heart, bear in mind the mission, push China and Kazakhstan to build the "Belt and Road" to move steadily and further, draw a more beautiful construction of the "Belt and Road" "pen painting," and dedicate all its strength to the development and construction of the motherland and friendly cooperation between China and Kazakhstan.
The T2 terminal of Liangjiang International Airport in Guilin, Guangxi, was officially opened on June 30.
Zhao Le Qin, secretary of the Guilin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, said that after the opening of the new terminal, it was able to meet the throughput demand of 12 million passengers a year, and built a new advantage in air traffic in Guilin. It is of great significance to further improve the modern three-dimensional traffic pattern of the "four-in-one" link between Jianghai, sea-rail transport, land and sea, and air ports in Guangxi.
This year, Guilin is expected to receive more than 90 million visitors.
The expansion of the T2 terminal and the supporting facilities of the Liangjiang International Airport in Guilin is a major public welfare project for the celebration of the 60th anniversary of the founding of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. It is also a landmark project for the construction of the international tourist resort in Guilin.
The project, which started in December 2015, has a floor area of 100,000 square metres, with a total investment of 3.258 billion yuan. When completed, it will meet the demand for an annual passenger throughput of 12 million passengers, take-off and landing of 1.012 million flights and a cargo throughput of 95,000 tons.
On the same day, more than 200 flights took off and landed at the T2 terminal of Liangjiang International Airport in Guilin.
The design of the new terminal is inspired by the landscape of Guilin, the distant view is like a "landscape laurel," the near view is like the "dragon ridge terraced fields" and the cascading eaves of the people's houses in the north of Guizhou, which are in harmony with the landscape of Guilin.
It is said that the new terminal of Guilin airport can meet the peak flow of nearly 4,000 person-times per hour in and out of Hong Kong, apply the intelligent baggage sorting system, security integration platform, face recognition and other technical means of "smart air port," and plan a business district covering a variety of business conditions, such as catering, department stores, duty-free and leisure and entertainment.
As growth in Europe, Asia and emerging markets is mostly uninspiring, the United States is increasingly becoming the main engine of global economic growth.
On September 23, 2018, a container freighter moored in the port in New Jersey, United States.
But because America's current growth has benefited from the timing of the fiscal stimulus of tax cuts, the country's economy has also received close attention.
"As the United States is returning to full employment, a downturn in the economy is inevitable."
The only question, he said, was when it would happen and, in his view, it might just not be pushed back in advance.
While Barclays is optimistic about the outlook for the US economy by the end of the year, the bank acknowledges that it is more difficult to make forecasts for further afield.
"In the absence of more sustainable investment growth to boost the growth potential of the economy, current fiscal-policy-inspired growth will not be sustainable," Barclays economists said in a research note.
"At a time of lack of investment growth, the risk of a hard landing for the economy in 2020 will rise," they said.
A series of business surveys will broadly show that the major economies are at the stage of the economic cycle at the end of the third quarter.
The eurozone and US manufacturing survey, due to be released next Monday, will receive attention, and the services survey will be released on Wednesday.
But the focus of next week's data is bound to be US non-farm employment data, to be released next Friday, which will provide clues as to whether the tight job market is driving significant wage growth.
This is important not only because it is important for the profitability of businesses and the purchasing power of consumers, but also because wage jumps or a rise in overall inflation could upset US Federal Reserve officials.
"Pay will be a lot of attention because it is likely to rise sharply again than in the previous month.
September's rise from a year earlier may not exceed 3%, but we can well expect a breakthrough next month, "ING economists wrote in a research note.
European politics is likely to be a source of market volatility at a time when holidays in China and other parts of Asia have led to weak data in the region next week.
The Italian government has ignored previous financial commitments to the EU, and other EU member states will have to quickly determine whether to firmly oppose Italy's decision, which Eritrea does not support and which he wants to abide by EU rules.

Meanwhile, concerns around emerging markets are unlikely to wane as Brazil holds its much-anticipated presidential election late next week.
[Abstract] When completed, the vessel will be delivered to the East China Sea Branch of the State Oceanic Administration of China, and Chen Zhi, Head of the Observation Department of the Marine Early Warning and Monitoring Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China, said the vessel will be of great significance for the development of China's offshore ocean observation system and the promotion of global ocean observation.
On September 29, China's first 3,000-ton large-scale buoy vessel, the "Xiangyang Hong 22," was launched at the China Wu Ship Group.
When completed, the ship will break the current equipment bottleneck in China's security work, such as large buoys, submersible deployment, recovery and rush repair.
The "Xiangyang Hong 22" wheel is mainly used for buoy / submersible regular inspection and maintenance, regular deployment and recovery, buoy / submersible emergency deployment, recovery, rush repair and other security work, as well as the ability to carry out comprehensive marine investigation tasks such as cross-section investigation.
The new ship has a total length of 89 metres, a width of 18 metres and a depth of 7.2 metres, with a renewed capacity of 10,000 nautical miles.
"The Xiangyang Hong 22 is the first large buoy operating vessel in China and the only working vessel in China with the operational capability to lift a 10-meter large buoy, which will further enhance the protection capacity of China's large buoys," said Wang Wei-ling, deputy general manager of the Wu Boat Group.
It is understood that when completed, the vessel will be handed over to the East China Sea Branch of the State Oceanic Administration of China, and Chen Zhi, Head of the Observation Division of the Marine Early Warning and Monitoring Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China, said the vessel will be of great significance for the development of China's offshore ocean observation system and the promotion of global ocean observation.
"The ship, which also has large-scale buoy deployment and maintenance operations, as well as an integrated marine survey capability, is the first comprehensive ship in our country dedicated to buoy operations and integrated marine surveys in the mid-to-long sea.
With such a buoy operating vessel, we will have a powerful tool for ocean observation and ocean investigation in the future. "
China new net Qingdao October 1 electricity affected by the sound of Typhoon "Tan Mei," the 2018 International Limit Sailing Series Qingdao Station "Maze Run Cup," scheduled to start on September 30, postponed the first race day to October 1, and held a pre-match meeting at the Qingdao Olympic Sailing Center before the race, with the appearance of
Affected by the sound of Typhoon Tam Mei, strong winds continued in the Hong Kong pool, with maximum wind speeds of up to 24 knots, the departure signal was delayed by nearly 90 minutes from 1 p.m. on October 30, and the wind speed was still not reduced. The president of the event ordered Anne Mderant to cancel the first day of the game and postpone the game until the afternoon of October 1.
"The strong winds from the shore continue, and the state of the sea is really too strong."
Mderant explained: 'In this case, no one knows when the gust is blowing towards the racing boat with what kind of wind
Close to the city's playing field, in the current wind conditions, the cancellation of the game is the most sensible choice. "
There was still some disappointment for the crew who were all ready.
"The race boat is ready to stop, and we are in good shape."
Max Richardson, the helmsman of the Qingdao team, admitted: "But I know the game is the right choice, and I hope the wind is smaller today and we can do it."
"The loss of a day has made the game more interesting," said Omika Wilkinson, known as the "Star of Hope" for New Zealand at the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games.
Because the weight of today's game will increase, and there are only two days left to play.
Everyone is going to be particularly desperate.
Although the sea wind was fierce, Pierre Ives Durand, the helmsman of France's ABM team, appealed at a pre-race meeting about his warm past with Qingdao, where the race was held: He suffered an accidental injury and a broken muscle in the International Extreme Sailing Series five years ago, and thanks to the handling of the local competition medical team, he was able to stand at the venue today five years later.
It is reported that the International Extreme Sailing Series, which was founded in 2007, is known as the World Sailing League with events such as Volvo, the America's Cup and the World Sailing Tour.
The Qingdao station competition will adopt the "flying ghost" water wing double sail (Flying Phantom).
2018 is the eighth year that the event landed in Qingdao, the "sailing capital," and the Qingdao station is also the end of the series.
Despite the continuing turmoil in global financial markets, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said Monday that the investment income of foreign exchange funds fell by 97 per cent a year in the third quarter of this year, but better than in the previous quarter, as overseas stocks rose and foreign exchange losses narrowed sharply in the wake of the China-US trade war.
According to the latest data from the HKMA, foreign exchange funds recorded investment income of HK $1.6 billion in July-September 2018, down sharply from HK $61.8 billion in the same period last year, but better than the revised HK $100 million in the second quarter of this year.
Chen Tak-lin, President of the HKMA, said in the Legislative Council that at the beginning of the China-US trade war, stock indices in Hong Kong and emerging markets ran counter to the US stock index. After the US stock market index peaked at the end of September and early October, market sentiment began to reverse, as investors became aware that the trade war was also bad for the US itself.
"It is good that there has been a change in market sentiment, and if the trade war has only a unilateral impact, it will do little to solve things."
But "if the China-US trade war is not resolved, financial market volatility will continue to rise," he said.
In the third quarter of this year, the stock investment losses of foreign exchange funds in Hong Kong narrowed by 8 per cent to HK $4.7 billion from the previous quarter, while overseas equity investment earnings surged by 172 per cent to HK $12.8 billion. Foreign exchange losses of HK $16.2 billion and bond earnings of HK $9.7 billion decreased by 24 per cent and 31 per cent, respectively, mainly reflecting a general rise in the US dollar against major currencies during the quarter and a rise in the US interest rate of 3 per cent in mid-September.
The foreign exchange fund is mainly used to support the Hong Kong dollar.
Hong Kong has implemented a linked exchange rate system between the Hong Kong dollar and the United States dollar since 1983.
In response to the current financial situation in Hong Kong, Mr Chan said there was increased uncertainty in the economy and asset markets and increased downside risks, but the Hong Kong financial system was robust, well-defended and well-earthquake-resistant.
"Hong Kong has a strong international investment position, with an external net worth of $1.4 trillion equivalent to four times GDP, up from 2.5 times that of Singapore and 0.6 times that of Japan, more than enough to cope with the economic downturn or reversal," he said.
Recently, interest rates in the Hong Kong dollar have continued to fall and the spread between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar has widened. Mr Chen pointed out that the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate rose by more than 400 basis points on September 21. The market is widely believed to be mainly related to the rise in interest rates in the Hong Kong dollar. Since then, the Hong Kong dollar has hovered around 7.80-7.84 against the US dollar. The recent continued decline in interest rates in the Hong Kong dollar and an increase in interest-rate spreads with the US dollar could attract the market to sell the Hong Kong dollar and buy the US dollar, giving the Hong Kong dollar a greater chance of triggering a weak exchange guarantee again than in the previous period.
But he believes that with the start of the Bank of Hong Kong's interest-rate cycle and the normalization of the Hong Kong dollar interest rate, the future of the Hong Kong dollar interest rate below the US dollar will change.
"The Hong Kong dollar interest rate will be more in line with the US dollar interest rate, and we must be more careful to manage risks and be prepared to cope with market volatility," he said.
The three-month interest rate fell 0.9 per cent to 2.08179 per cent on Monday, expanding from 46 basis points to 51 basis points, while the one-month interest rate hit a five-month low, widening from 120 basis points to 127 basis points, owing to the abundance of Hong Kong dollar funds.
The spot exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar has been close to 7.85 to the US dollar for most of the period from May to mid-September.
During the period, the weak exchange guarantee was triggered again in May and August, after it was first triggered in April, due to factors such as interest-rate activities and the outflow of some of the funds from the Hong Kong dollar after the completion of large-scale stock-taking activities.
The HKMA bought the Hong Kong dollar and sold the United States dollar at the level of 7.85 in accordance with the linked exchange rate system, so as to maintain the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.
The HKMA bought a total of about HK $52.1 billion under the weak exchange guarantee mechanism in May and August.
Does the new tax law still have a discount for people outside the country?
In response to a question from reporters on June 30, the relevant officials of the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation said that in order to maintain policy stability, the next step in the implementation of the new personal income tax law will consider continuing to make preferential arrangements for people from abroad, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
Some journalists asked that the newly revised Individual Income Tax Law has adjusted the standard for the determination of China's individual income tax resident taxpayers from a full year to a full 183 days.
May I ask if there are any preferential arrangements for people from abroad, including those from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, when implementing the Act?
The person-in-charge responded that the regulations for the implementation of the current Individual Income Tax Law have special preferential provisions on the issue of tax payment by persons outside China, and that individuals who have no residence within the territory of China but have lived for more than one year and less than five years may pay individual income tax only on the portion paid by units or individuals within the territory of China.
The person-in-charge said that in order to maintain policy stability, the next step in the implementation of the new personal income tax law will consider continuing to make preferential arrangements for people from abroad, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
There is no "threshold" of the moon center: Quality certification to promote quality improvement.
With the pull of the "two-child economy" and the prosperity of the mother-and-child market, from the north to three or four cities, various levels of monthly clubhouses have sprung up all over the world.
The current fiery Moon Club has met the consumer needs of the masses, with fees ranging from tens of thousands of yuan to hundreds of thousands of yuan, but it is also in an awkward situation. The agency has no threshold so far, and there is a gap in supervision.
The State Administration of Market Supervision has recently launched a series of national "Quality Month" activities in 2018, and journalists have come to a five-star Moon Center in Tianjin to visit the certification experience of mother-and-child care services.
The general Moon Center provides services such as newborn care, nutritious meals, post-partum repair and plasticization.
At the moon center, the reporter saw that nurses check the breastfeeding of newborns on a daily basis, and professional care workers provide fine nursing services such as bathing and touching for newborns.
At the same time, in order to meet the needs of new mothers, from the early wound care of the moon, to the mid- and late-stage beauty care and other services, to provide traditional Chinese medicine treatment and beauty care projects, so as to help mothers restore their fair body position.
A new mother living in the house told reporters that she had only booked the moon club eight months in advance.
The service items of the monthly clubhouse have a direct impact on the comfort and physical recovery of the mother during the month. Some small-scale clubhouses can only provide some simple monthly services. There are hidden problems such as non-standard disinfection and hygiene, easy cross-infection, unscientific diet, etc.
The head of the moon center said they were the only one of all five-star moon centers in Tianjin to be certified as a B-level service.
"Although some customers do not understand the meaning of B-level certification at first, it is important for the long-term development of the enterprise to push back the strict and standardized process management of the enterprise through certification, so as to benefit the customer," he said.
Service certification is a new certification system based on customer perception, attention to organizational quality management and the satisfaction of service characteristics. It is an important part of the country's quality infrastructure and plays a positive role in raising the proportion of the supply of high-quality services and enhancing the international competitiveness of Chinese services, said Pan Liifen, deputy director of the Certification and Supervision Department of the State Administration of Market Supervision.
Starting in 2004, after more than 10 years of development, the service certification project has gone through a process of gradual development, and a number of influential service certification have emerged, such as financial service certification, mother-and-child care service certification, commodity after-sale service certification, e-commerce service certification, and health service certification.
According to the State Administration of Market Supervision, at present, China has more than 130 service certification institutions, more than 2,000 service certification personnel, and nearly 8,000 valid certification certificates.
Mr Pan said it was necessary to further guide and promote the development of service certification, gradually expand the coverage of service certification in the areas of health, education, sports, finance and e-commerce, and contribute to supply-side reform and quality improvement in the service sector.
Hong Kong (Reuters) - Hong Kong property prices fell for two consecutive months after peaking, Chen Tak-lin, president of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, said on Monday that it would take time to see whether the property market had entered a downward cycle and that, if confirmed, consideration could be given to easing the tightening of counter-cyclical measures in due course.
Mr Chan added that, in the event of a correction in property prices, the first to be affected would be those who bought property at the peak of the property market, but the chances of a sharp drop in property prices and a sharp drop in property prices were expected to be much lower, such as during the Asian financial storm in 1997.
Speaking at the Legislative Council briefing, Mr Chan, who led a number of senior officials of the HKMA, said that if it was confirmed that the property market had entered a downward cycle, it would be possible to relax measures in due
"But with only a few weeks of data, it is still early to relax, and there is still more time to see whether the property market is entering a downward cycle," he said.
Since October 2009, the HKMA has launched eight rounds of counter-cyclical measures to significantly tighten mortgages on all types of properties, including reducing the number of mortgages and the need for mortgage applicants to pass rigorous stress tests, so as to enhance bank risk management and earthquake
As Hong Kong formally entered the cycle of interest rate hikes, the territory-wide private residential property price index peaked for two consecutive months from August to September, and the monthly decline widened to 1.44 per cent in September.
But the cumulative increase in the first three quarters of this year was still 10.2 per cent.
According to the HKMA, the financial situation of households measuring the seismic capacity of Hong Kong to face financial risks is still healthy. In the second quarter of this year, the proportion of households without mortgages in Hong Kong was 66 per cent, higher than the average of 60 per cent in 2009-11. The average number of new mortgages and the contribution-to-income ratio of new mortgages were 47 per cent and 34 per cent, respectively, a marked improvement from 64 per cent and 41 per cent, respectively, in 2009-11.
But Mr Chen said the high earthquake resistance does not mean that residents will not be affected by the economic downturn, as property valuations will fall and those who buy buildings during the peak period will bear the brunt of it.
Although the HKMA has tightened bank lending to mortgage lenders, home buyers can also obtain a high percentage of mortgage lending through mortgage insurance or mortgage loans provided by developers.
Mr Chan said that, together with the mortgage loans provided to developers, the number of borrowers could reach 85-90 per cent. If property prices fell by 10 per cent, there would be negative assets (that is, the market value of the property fell below the level of the total outstanding mortgage loan).
However, Nguyen Kwok Hang, Vice President of the HKMA, pointed out that the authorities estimate that the total number of mortgages provided by developers is only 2-2.5 per cent of the total number of bank mortgages, which is still low.
At the peak of negative assets in Hong Kong in 2003, the number of negative assets exceeded 100,000, accounting for 22 per cent of the supply of buildings.
As of the third quarter of this year, Hong Kong had recorded zero negative assets for seven consecutive quarters.

China new net Shenzhen October 1 (Zheng Xiao Hong Xu Dian Wei Liu Shu Meng) October 1 is the first day of the Mainland National Day "Golden Week" and the last day of the Hong Kong National Day public holiday. Many Mainland residents take advantage of the holiday to go abroad to play and shop. Many Hong Kong residents who come to Shenzhen also return to Hong Kong on the same day. There are passenger flow "burst sheds" at Shenzhen ports. The Luohu and Shenzhen Bay ports have opened 22 new self-service channels to enhance the customs clearance efficiency of the ports and facilitate efficient and rapid customs clearance.

All the ports were always busy and undisturbed, and maintained a good entry and exit order.
It is understood that, under the influence of a number of positive factors, such as the increase in the number of countries providing an exit visa-free policy for Chinese citizens, there has been a steady increase in the number of tourists taking advantage of the National Day holiday to holiday shopping in countries such as Europe and Southeast Asia.
Early in the morning, the outbound direction of the ports of Luohu, Shenzhen Bay, Huanggang and Fukuda ushered in the peak passenger flow. Among them, the peak passenger flow at the Luohu Port continued from 9: 00 a.m. to 11: 00 a.m. and the peak passenger flow at the Shenzhen Bay Port from 6: 30 a.m. to 13: 00 noon.
It is said that, in order to cope with the peak flow of inbound and outbound passengers (vehicles), the Shenzhen border control station, in accordance with the unified deployment of the State Immigration Administration, launched the peak-hour service mode of the passenger (vehicle) flow, arranged for overtime police to support the line of duty, opened sufficient inspection channels in advance, guided passengers and vehicles to wait for inspection in an orderly manner, so as to ensure that the entry and exit clearance queues of Chinese citizens do not exceed 30 minutes, taking into account the customs clearance efficiency of foreigners; and strengthened the maintenance of order in crowded areas so as to ensure that customs clearance is safe and orderly.
The Shenzhen border control terminus also reminds inbound and outbound passengers that before travel, they should pay attention to the validity period of documents, visas and endorsement, make reasonable arrangements for the itinerary, avoid peak passenger flow times as much as possible, and choose the right time and the right port to travel.
Passengers travelling to Hong Kong on the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong high-speed rail are required to hold valid entry and exit documents and visa endorsement. High-speed rail tickets are only travel documents and cannot be used as entry and exit documents. If they are unable to leave Hong Kong for reasons such as non-compliance with the documentation procedures, they should follow the guidelines of the civilian police on border inspection duty and wait at designated locations for the staff of the MTR Corporation to take them back to the Mainland for travel.
Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic and difficult disease involving multiple organs throughout the body, which has been considered an "incurable disease" in the past.
Because the pathogenesis is unknown, the diagnosis and treatment is difficult, there is a lack of effective treatment and must not be radical.
Recently, a joint team of Liu Wanli, a researcher at the School of Life Sciences at Tsinghua University, and Chestnut Chaoguo, director of the Center for Rheumatic Immunization at the People's Hospital of Peking University, have found that human immunoglobulin has a molecular variation that increases the susceptibility of systemic lupus erythematosus, and that this variation is involved in the regulation of immune B cells.
In short, the two teams confirmed that an abnormal immune molecule in the body is an important cause of the onset of systemic lupus erythematosus.
According to Sun Xiaolin of Peking University People's Hospital, one of the authors of the article, the chestnut team collected and studied nearly 2,000 large samples of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, and found that patients with immunoglobulin variants produced disease-causing cells and a wide variety and large number of autoantibodies, and that there was a marked increase in the incidence and severity of inflammation such as nephritis, arthritis, sermatitis and hemangitis.
Through a variety of research methods, such as immune cell tracer, animal testing and sequencing, the Liu Wanli team found the immune signaling pathway activated by this immune molecule mutation and the pathogenic mechanism that promotes B cells to secrete a variety of autoantibodies.
The reporter learned that the two teams are strong and strong, give full play to their respective advantages, and realize the close combination of basic research and clinical application.
Liu Wanli's team is committed to the study of B lymphocyte immune recognition and immune activation, while the chestnut team has long been engaged in the clinical study of systemic lupus erythematosus.
"This study is one of the results of many years of collaboration between the two teams. It is also the first time that the academic community has realized that immune globulin gene abnormalities will induce systemic lupus erythematosus, laying a solid foundation for further academic research and clinical targeted treatment."
This is not to protect the short, but to act in accordance with the law.
The lawyer took the axe to the court?
The news was really exciting at first glance, and the pot was blown up in the legal circle.
The Central Law of Quanzhou City, Fujian Province, then fined the lawyer 500 yuan and recommended in writing that the Quanzhou City Bar Association conduct an investigation and deal with the matter.
A few days ago, the Quanzhou Municipal Law Association issued an official notice that the actions of the two lawyers did not involve violations of laws and regulations and were not punished in accordance with the law, the Beijing News reported.
From many reports, the treatment of the Quanzhou City Law Association is not short protection or confrontation, but has been recognized by the Quanzhou Central Court.
An incident that could have triggered tensions within the legal community was eventually properly resolved.
The reversal of the matter stems from a more complete restoration of the truth: The axe carried by the lawyer involved was of the same style and model as the defendant's murder weapon, but did not open the edge, was used only as supporting evidence in the examination of evidence, and did not have the subjective intention of intimidating or "endangering the safety of the court."
To judge whether the lawyer's actions were in violation of the law, there were four very important details to pay attention to: First, the local court had held two previous sessions and produced only a photograph of the axe, which was necessary from the point of view of the defence; second, the axe was purchased only one hour before the hearing, and the lawyer was not unwilling to seek the consent of the judge, but was objectively unable to contact the judge; third, the whole axe had not been used excessively or inappropriately; and fourth, the lawyer publicly admitted his mistake for the first time and apologized to the court.
A combination of these circumstances, it can be seen that the lawyer "brought an axe to court" has nothing to do with the crime, but only for the defence.
After clarifying the whole fact, the Quanzhou City Law Association did not push the boat, but stood up to the pressure and made a decision not to punish.
And this decision can stand the test of the facts and the law.
As for bringing the axe, which is a controlled tool, to court without the permission of the court, it is indeed easy to cause unease and misunderstanding.
For reasons of safety and caution, the Quanzhou Central Court's previous fine penalties and judicial advice are also justified.
In order to safeguard the dignity of lawyers and prevent individual courts from making it difficult for lawyers, the Supreme Law issued the Rules for the Security Inspection of the Judicial Police of the People's Courts in 2014, establishing the principle that lawyers do not need to carry out physical security checks in court.
Since the issuance of the rule, a large number of lawyers have led by example, and there have been few incidents that endanger the security of the Tribunal as a result of security breaches.
In very few cases, such as Quanzhou, as long as communication is carried out in a spirit of mutual respect and understanding, misunderstanding is not difficult to eliminate.
The Bar Association, as a self-regulatory organization of the bar industry, has the dual mission of punishing wrongdoings and safeguarding legality.
In the past, individual law organizations have been criticized for their emphasis on discipline and loss of security.
And the Quanzhou Law Association's decision, both in terms of process and results, is commendable, setting an example for more law associations to perform their duties correctly.
From October 1, which tax benefits will affect our bags of money?
Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 1 (journalist Sang Tong) The new personal income tax law will come into force on January 1, 2019. In order for the broad masses of the people to enjoy the dividends of tax reduction as soon as possible, starting from October 1, the actual income from wages and salaries earned by taxpayers will be deducted at the starting point of 5,000 yuan per month, and a new tax rate scale will be applied.
With the landing of the New Deal, what good will affect the money bags of the masses?
Good one: There is a marked reduction in the amount of tax on wages and salaries
Taxpayers who receive wages and salaries after October 1 can deduct the basic deduction of $5,000 per month and apply the new tax rate scale, and most taxpayers have different levels of tax cuts, especially for low- and middle-income people.
According to the schedule of tax cuts for different income groups, the monthly income after deducting the "Three Risks" amounts to 8,000 yuan, 10,000 yuan, 20,000 yuan and 50,000 yuan, the tax payable after the tax reform is 90 yuan, 290 yuan, 1,590 yuan and 9,090 yuan, respectively. Compared with the monthly starting point of 3,500 yuan, the corresponding tax reduction rates are 73.9 per cent, 61.1 per cent, 49.0 per cent and 18.8 per cent, respectively.
It is worth noting that, for holiday reasons, the salaries paid by units in accordance with the law at the end of September, which were supposed to be paid in October, may be subject to a new basic schedule of deduction of expenses and tax rates.
To this end, the withholding client software, which has been uniformly promoted by the tax authorities, has provided the corresponding tax calculation function, but the corresponding tax still has to be declared and paid within the statutory filing period.
Good 2: There has been a marked increase in the range of low-tax brackets
In addition to raising the starting point, a new scale of tax rates will be applied from 1 October.
The seven-step tax rate on wages and salaries is the same as before, but there has been a marked change in the range of tax rates, with a marked increase in the range of the three lower tax rates of 3 per cent, 10 per cent and 20 per cent, and a reduction in the range of 25 per cent, while the range of the higher tax rates of 30 per cent, 35 per cent and 45 per cent has remained the same.
It is worth noting that the tax law has also adjusted the tax rates on income from production and operation, of which the lower limit of the most high-end 35 per cent tax rate has been raised from 100,000 yuan to 500,000 yuan.
This means that individual businesses and sole proprietorship partnerships will all benefit from the tax reform.
"Judging from the calculation of individual tax cuts for Shanghai taxpayers in the previous period, a large number of taxpayers will fully feel the dividends of individual tax reform, especially for low- and middle-income people," he said.
Lan Min, head of the personal income tax department of the Shanghai Municipal Taxation Bureau of the State Administration of Taxation, said.
Good 3: Tax service is more convenient and optimized
Since the promulgation of the new personal income tax law, the Shanghai tax authorities have launched a series of comprehensive and wide-ranging tax publicity actions.
On the one hand, we will carry out "one-on-one, point-to-point" policy guidance to key tax sources and key enterprises.
The Tax Bureau of the Pudong New Area has successively visited large enterprises, such as Apple Trade (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., Alipay (China) Network Technology Co., Ltd., and Red Star Mei Kailong Home Group Co., Ltd., which have a large number of employees, a large withholding workload and a large amount of tax payment, and the tax authorities have taken the initiative to provide guidance and answer questions. The Xuhui District Tax Bureau has visited Zhong Zhi Financial Consulting Co., Ltd., Zhong Zhi Shanghai Economic and Technical Cooperation Co., Ltd., a large labour enterprise in the region, so as to collect the concerns of enterprises in a timely manner, respond to the demands of enterprises and solve the difficulties of enterprises.
On the other hand, to the vast majority of citizen taxpayers, carry out the "omni-directional, multi-dimensional, individualized" tax policy.
Use the Shanghai tax official website, micro-letter public number, microblogging and other channels to push the policy hotspot in time to ensure that the policy publicity is in place.
At the same time, since September 28, the Shanghai tax mini-letter to the public on-line 12366 intelligent consultation platform, through the "artificial + intelligence" tax service consultation, launched the "target" intelligent integrated individual tax reform publicity service.
On the evening of November 4, the official website of the FA officially announced that former England captain Wayne Rooney will return to the England national team for a warm-up match against the United States on November 15.

A three-way trade agreement between the United States and Mexico would open up new opportunities for 500 million people.
According to foreign media reports, a joint statement by Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland and US Trade Representative Wright Heitzer, published on the Canadian government's website, said the United States, Canada and Mexico had reached a three-way trade agreement, which would be known as the "USMCA" (the US-Mexico-Canada three-country agreement)
Earlier, Canada's CTV News television quoted senior US sources as saying that Canada and the United States had resolved their differences and reached an agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
The Washington Post, citing two sources with knowledge of the situation, reported that the September 30 agreement between the United States and Canada would retain NAFTA as a tripartite trade agreement, and that the heads of the three countries would sign a new agreement within two months.
"Today, Canada, the United States, and Mexico have agreed on a new trade deal, the USMCA, which will provide our workers, farmers, and companies with high standards of trade agreements that will lead to freer markets, fairer deals, and more sustainable economic growth, which will strengthen the middle class, create high-paying jobs, and bring new opportunities to about 500 million people," the statement said.
It is reported that the current North American Free Trade Agreement was signed by the United States, Mexico and Canada in 1994.
After taking office as president, Trump announced plans to reconsider the agreement and sign a new agreement.
The three countries began this negotiating process from 2017.
The early election of the Governor of Okinawa, due to the illness and death of former Governor Weng Xiongzhi, announced the results in the early hours of local time, and Danny Yucheng, who opposed the planned relocation of the US military base in Japan, was successfully elected.
The final results of the election, which was counted on September 30, showed that Yucheng received a total of 396,632,000 votes, the most in the history of the election of the governor of Okinawa Prefecture, more than 80,000 votes more than his main rival, Zohi-chun.
A total of four candidates took part in the election, with a turnout of 63.24 per cent, down 0.89 percentage points from the 2014 election of the governor of Okinawa Prefecture.
Yucheng told the media on January 1 that the election results showed that the county people did not want Governor Weng's efforts to be in vain, and that he would inherit the legacy of Governor Weng and continue to make efforts to the Japanese government and the US government against the relocation plan of the US military base and the closure of the Putian base.
The US military base in Yoshino Bay, Okinawa Prefecture, has long been criticized, and the Japanese and US government had previously agreed to relocate it to the border area of the city, but there was strong opposition from Okinawa, hoping to move the base out of Okinawa altogether.
In response to the county people's strong opposition to the relocation plan and the requirement to revoke the permit for land reclamation along the ancient coast of the border, Yucheng said he had not been in a position of confrontation and division with the central government at the beginning, in the hope that the two sides would fully exchange views and demonstrate their intention to resolve through consultation.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also told the media on the morning of January 1 that he would seriously accept the outcome and that efforts would be made to revitalize Okinawa and ease the burden on the base.
Speaking at a press conference on January 1, Kan Yiwei, Japan's chief government secretary, said there had been no change in the government's policy to relocate the US military base as soon as possible.
At the same time, he also expressed his intention to hold talks with Yucheng.
Yucheng will officially take up the post of Governor of Okinawa Prefecture on the 4th of this month.
Since the mid-2000s, as China's demand for oilseeds has grown, Paul Thomas, a North Dakota farmer in the United States, has grown more and more soybeans in his fields.
The shift peaked this year, when he planted 1,600 acres of soybeans in 5,000 acres on a scale never seen before.
But Thomas and many farmers like him plan to switch to staple crops in former U.S. agricultural areas in 2019: Corn and wheat.
U.S. farmers have grown more soybeans than corn this year, for the first time in 35 years.
The plan to switch to other food crops is due to the plight of US farmers selling soybeans in the context of US President Donald Trump's trade war against China.
China usually buys about 60 per cent of US exports of soybeans, but the trade war has led to almost zero purchases of US soybeans in recent months, sending the price of soybeans to a 10-year low.
Thomas intends to grow more wheat next year, hoping to make more by reducing dependence on crops that depend on Chinese demand.
Mr Thomas said the price of soybeans had "hit us hard."
He said the spot price of soybeans near his farm was $7.10 a bushel without Chinese demand, while the price necessary to cover the cost was $8.50.
American farmers have set a record high in soybean cultivation this year, and the harvest is expected to reach a record high.
At such a time when they are vulnerable to shocks, they have been hit by a trade war.
In response to Trump's imposition of additional tariffs on imports of Chinese goods, China imposed additional import tariffs on imports of US soybeans in July.
The US Department of Agriculture will release its first estimate of the area under cultivation next year, which is expected to include consideration of the impact of tariffs.
The estimate is expected to confirm the expectations of private institutions that the sowing area of soybeans will be reduced.
On October 19, Informa Economics projected a 4 per cent to 92.7 million acre increase in corn cultivation in 2019, according to a report seen by Reuters.(3,750万公顷 ) As a result, the area under soybean cultivation will be reduced by 7 per cent to 83 million acres
Informa also expects a 4 per cent increase in U.S. wheat cultivation.
The area of soybeans planted before retaliatory tariffs rose to 89.6 million acres this year, about 15 million acres higher than 10 years ago.
Corn has grown by less than 5 million acres to 89.1 million since 2008, and wheat has grown by 47.8 million acres this year, close to its lowest level in 100 years.
Aron Carlson, president of the Illinois Corn Growing Association, whose home has a total area of 3,600 acres, will spend nearly half this year on growing soybeans, but plans to cut it in the future.
He said it was possible to increase corn cultivation by up to 20 percent on his farm in northern Illinois, which is the largest soybean-growing state in the United States.
Soybeans produce less per acre than corn, but less fertiliser is needed, which makes soybeans generally less expensive to grow.
If farmers switch to final-value corn, it may raise costs, but it will benefit a number of businesses, including Andersons Inc fertilizer sellers.
Andersons executive Pat Bowe told Reuters he expected the switch to corn would benefit fertilizer use.
Bayer is also expected to benefit from farmers switching to corn.
Sutirawa, head of the Nongman Airport Authority in Bangkok, apologized for the beating of a Chinese citizen at the airport and said Thailand welcomed Chinese tourists and that the authorities would strengthen management, raise awareness of services and avoid similar incidents.
On July 27, the security guard at Langman airport had a physical confrontation with a Chinese man who had been refused entry, it said.
Sutirawa said that the security guard had committed a serious breach of discipline, that he had been suspended by the Airport Authority and that, in accordance with the procedure, an investigation committee had been set up to investigate the matter, and that the security guard would be dismissed if the matter was true.
At present, the Thai Immigration Bureau has arranged for the man to take the opportunity to return to China.
Sutirawa apologized for the incident, which had damaged Thailand's image, and said the Thai side attached great importance to the matter, was willing to do its best to reduce the impact of the incident on the beaten tourists, and would send a letter of apology to the parties through the Chinese Embassy in Thailand.
Langman Airport is ready to facilitate Chinese tourists to Thailand and, in conjunction with the Thai Immigration Bureau, set up special entry routes for Chinese tourists at Thailand's five major international airports, including Suwannap, Langman, Chiang Mai, Phuket and Hei Ai in Bangkok, he said.
He said that, as a next step, the Airport Authority would rectify the landing area, specify the landing fee, and improve the quality of service and communication skills of the staff.
After learning of the matter, the Chinese Embassy in Thailand made contact with the parties for the first time to understand the history of the matter.
At the same time, representations have been made to the heads of the Thai Immigration Bureau, the Airport Authority and the Ministry of Tourism and Sports, requesting the Thai side to thoroughly investigate the incident and severely punish the perpetrators, and will continue to maintain close communication with the Thai side, properly handle the matter and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the parties concerned.
Xinhua International Time Review: To defend multilateralism and the unity of Chinese knowledge and practice.
At a time when unilateralism is surging against the current, international rules and the multilateral order have been hit.
To some extent, the confrontation between unilateralism and multilateralism has entered a critical period.
As a responsible power, with the concept of good momentum, good road and solid and strong action, China has worked with the international community to safeguard multilateralism and push it forward.
In the face of the new challenges of the new situation, China has made a loud voice on the direction and path of multilateralism.
As State Councilor and Minister for Foreign Affairs Wang Yi said in his speech at the general debate of the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, multilateralism in the new era should adhere to the goal of win-win cooperation, be based on the rules and order, be aimed at fairness and justice, and be oriented towards effective action.
At the same time, China calls for the construction of a global pattern of development cooperation, with the United Nations at its core, North-South cooperation as the main channel and South-South cooperation as a complement, and calls on all parties to work together to build a community of human destiny.
China's thinking and voice reflect the mainstream voice of the international community.
As Espinosa, President of the 73rd United Nations General Assembly, said, in the current situation, "more than ever, the United Nations needs to promote multilateralism and maintain a rules-based international system."
Lagarde, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, said the international community should continue to firmly uphold the multilateral trading system, adhere to international trade rules and resolve differences through consultation.
In recent years, with the adjustment of the balance of global economic and political forces, a number of emerging markets and groups of developing countries have emerged to play a greater role in the major international multilateral mechanisms, providing a new impetus for the development of multilateralism in the face of headwinds.
Standing in this dimension, the concept of multilateralism advocated by China, such as building a large family, rather than cobbling together small circles, insisting on co-building rather than winner-take-all, in line with the trend of the times, is an inevitable choice to meet global challenges and solve the world's problems, and represents the common aspirations of most countries in the world.
There are advanced ideas and more solid actions.
China's "Belt and Road" initiative has become the largest platform for international cooperation.
China has launched international and regional cooperation initiatives, such as "One Belt, One Road," the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and "16 + 1 Cooperation," to promote international and regional cooperation, improve and supplement the existing international system and order, bring innovative vitality to multilateral cooperation, and contribute to the development of the international order in a more just and rational direction.
As a defender of the international order and a practitioner of multilateralism, China's actions are becoming more and more powerful in the multilateral arena of the United Nations.
Good offices for international hot spots, combating climate change, participating in peacekeeping operations, making great efforts to reduce poverty and help other countries implement the 2030 sustainable development agenda.
As United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said, China has become an important pillar of multilateralism.
When the "trust deficit" facing the world increases, and when populism and polarization are on the rise, it is the world's most pressing need for multilateral cooperation.
At such a historical juncture, the international community needs to join hands to translate consensus into action, resolutely defend multilateralism and jointly promote the building of a community of human destiny.
Sino-new net Guangzhou September 30 (reporter Sowei) Guangdong's first national standard 4K demonstration district was unveiled on September 30 in the Jiancheng Garden District, Haizhu District, Guangzhou. On the same day, the Guangdong Radio and Television Network's 4K business in the whole province was officially launched, and the opening ceremony of the central radio and television station 4K ultra-high-definition channel in Guangdong Province was held simultaneously.
The day's event was co-hosted by Guangdong Cable Radio and Television Network Co. Ltd. and the Leading Group on Co-operation and Shared Social Governance in the Tai Tong area of Haizhu District.
According to the deployment of the provincial government of the Guangdong Provincial Committee, the Guangdong Radio and Television Network has actively implemented the new digital family 4K action plan. In December 2017, it released the country's first new digital home gateway terminal product to support IPv6 and the first national radio and television network to support 4 true 4K, the "U-point home server" (with the AVS2 standard 4K box and Telefly voice remote control), accelerated the construction of a new digital home demonstration area marked by 4K ultra-high-definition video, next-generation Internet and wired wireless fusion network applications, and actively participated in the construction of the 4K television network application demonstration area in Guangdong Province.
In 2018, the Guangdong Radio and Television Network launched a series of radio and television Huimin initiatives, and launched the "Radio and Television 4K Service Month" to promote the "U-point home server" in the whole province.
On the day of the event, the Guangdong Radio and Television Network's 4K business across the province was officially launched, and the first 4K smart TV Ping An Home Sharing Platform project, based on 4K applications, was officially unveiled and launched. The platform was jointly built by the Office of the Leading Group on Co-Governance and Shared Social Governance in Dantang, Haizhu District, Guangdong Cable and Haizhu District. The platform project relies on the 4K ultra-clear U-point home server of the Guangdong Radio and Television Network to realize a new generation of intelligent family services based on the cable television network and integrate the relevant government services for the benefit of the people.

The report reads as follows: On September 30, it is the fifth anniversary of the martyr in the country
At 10 a.m. on the same day, party and state leaders such as Xi Jinping, together with representatives from all walks of life in the capital, attended a ceremony to lay a basket of flowers to the people's heroes in memory of the heroic martyrs.
CCTV issued a quick comment on this: This is the first martyr's anniversary after the implementation of the heroic martyr protection law in China.
Five years ago, the anniversary of the martyr was established on the eve of the National Day to show the great journey of the Chinese nation from suffering to glory, and we need to wake up at all times: "Where we come from, where we go."
Secretary-General Xi Jinping has profoundly pointed out that "abandoning tradition and losing it is tantamount to cutting off his spiritual lifeblood."
"Do not forget history to open up the future."
We advocate the hero, the memory of the martyr, is to always remember the history, continue the strong spirit, condense the strong positive energy of the national renaissance.
The quick review points out that Yingli is the backbone of the nation.
To honor the martyrs and pay tribute to the martyrs is to make Britain a noble, holy and powerful eternal memory in the heart of our hearts.
According to incomplete statistics, about 20 million martyrs have died valiantly for national independence, the liberation of the people, the prosperity and strength of the country and the well-being of the people.
Every forerunner who died for his country will be remembered, and every spirit of loyalty to the country will be looked up to.
It is in order to pay tribute to them in the name of the country, deeply remember their great achievements, and learn to pass on their precious spirit of love for the motherland, loyalty to the people, selfless dedication and courage to sacrifice.
The governments of Party committees at all levels have improved the pension preferential treatment system and continuously raised the level of pension treatment, and the Party and the state have carried out the respect for the heroes with concrete actions.
Every year, countless people look up to the Martyrs' Cemetery, let us experience the deep feeling of the memory of the masses, and feel the impetus of the rejuvenation in the blood of the nation.
Respect for the hero, defend the hero, learn the hero, care for the hero in the whole society.
The quick review finally points out that, at a time when socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era, we can comfort the British people who sleep in the ground: A strong China is rising in the East, and the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is becoming a reality in our hands.
Let us forge ahead with the strength of the strong spirit and make progress towards the great goal!

The arrival of the fifth "Disability Voice Month" to pay attention to the issue of sex education for young people with disabilities - China New Network
In recent years, the topic of sex education for young people in China has been widely discussed, but the challenge for sex education for young people with disabilities is still difficult.
Recently, a seminar on challenges and practical strategies for comprehensive sex education for persons with disabilities was held in Beijing.
How to provide sex education for children and young people with disabilities has become an important topic of this seminar.
The Report on Sexual Knowledge, Attitudes and Behaviour of Disabled Children and Youth in China, released at the meeting, showed that the proportion of disabled children subjected to sexual harassment and sexual assault was higher than that of healthy children.
For children and adolescents with disabilities, more attention is also given to "sexual protection."
The purpose of the seminar was to explore the promotion of comprehensive sex education for children and young people with disabilities in China in terms of family support, school education and institutional services, and to provide support to children and young people with disabilities at the source so that they, like others, have the right to enjoy their love at home.
Experts believe that, for a long time, the Chinese public's understanding of the disabled has remained at a level that is not deep enough.
Under the influence of traditional attitudes and other factors, China's comprehensive sex education for people with disabilities, especially children and young people with disabilities, is not sufficiently advanced.
However, in recent years, with the support of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the public welfare community, there has been a welcome development in the practice and path of sexual and reproductive health education for the full-cycle development of persons with disabilities in China.
The Report shows that children and young people with visual, hearing, intellectual and physical impairments, although they may have more difficulties in gaining access to sexual knowledge and understanding of intimacy than the general population, have generally developed in a more convenient and enriching manner.
The Seminar on Challenges and Practical Strategies for Comprehensive Sex Education for Persons with Disabilities, hosted by the Shanghai People's Public Welfare Foundation and co-supported by the UNESCO Representative Office in China, the International Disability Alliance (France) Representative Office in Beijing and the UNFPA Representative Office in China, aims to jointly explore the practice and implementation path of sexual and reproductive health education for persons with disabilities throughout the full cycle in the context of the Great Strategy for Healthy China, promote awareness of international policies on comprehensive sexuality education and the right to health of children and youth with disabilities among various stakeholders in the field of special education and inclusive education, including policymakers, educators, researchers, social service organizations and parents' representatives; conduct extensive exchanges on sexual education practices, strategies, challenges and resources for children and youth with disabilities in the country, discuss and develop a blueprint for comprehensive sexuality education for children and youth with disabilities in the future, and form a support network.
Beijing (Reuters) - The central bank's short position on foreign currency-to-local currency forward contracts and futures contracts was zero for 12 consecutive months at the end of August, and there were still no long positions in the month, according to figures released by the People's Bank of China on Sunday.
The central bank's previous data showed that the central bank held a short position of $6.044 billion in foreign currency-to-local currency forward and futures contracts at the end of August, unchanged for the fourth consecutive month, with a short position of $4.276 billion in SDR (Special Drawing Rights).
Since then, the central bank's foreign exchange long-term short position has been zero.
The central bank first released the data at the end of March 2016; the data showed that at the end of February 2016, the central bank had a long position of $2,438 million in foreign currency-to-local currency forward and futures contracts and a short position of $28.9 billion.
The September data, released at the end of October of the same year, showed a net short increase of $16.401 billion to $45.301 billion for the first time.
The central bank has previously said that long-term and futures short positions in foreign currencies mainly reflect the foreign-exchange forward operations carried out by the central bank with commercial banks to meet the hedging needs of corporate foreign-currency liabilities, and will continue to provide long-term safe-haven products on a real-needs basis, with the central bank's forward operations having a smaller impact on the size of future foreign
On the evening of September 20 this year, on the K158 train, Joe, who was in his third year in Zhengzhou, took a car to the wall of the Crane.
A great man on the train bought a ticket without a seat, but took her seat: "Take a pat."
On a two-hour drive, the conductor advised him that an hour was still not valid.
In the end, a male passenger in the same car could not look down to drag the master up.
From the point of view of public opinion, although the end result is mostly that the bully is condemned by the public, administratively punished by the public security authorities, and even included in the integrity blacklist, the public still does not feel "hate": Why not allow the bully to be punished on the spot?
Why can not stop his unethical or even illegal behavior on the spot, but can only punish it afterwards?
And for the unreasonable behavior of the "master bully," how is it just a male passenger "rough road" and pull it up?
The main reason for this is that only long-distance trains are equipped with passengers, and short-distance trains generally do not; even if there are passengers, the police are more concerned about the possible rogue reaction of the bully and do not take coercive measures to remove them.
The repeated incidents of bully have made people realize that bullies must be forcibly removed or even punished on the spot in order to act as a deterrent.
This requires that our train passengers should dare to take strong measures in time, and trains without passengers should be deployed as soon as possible in order to prevent and combat violations in a timely manner.
On October 1, on the first day of the National Day holiday, vehicles surged in the direction of Songpan, Maoming County, via the Qiang Autonomous County of Beichuan, Sichuan Province.
At around 1300 hours, the Beichuan traffic police received a call for help, saying that his family had a traffic accident in Songpan and that there was an urgent need to be sent to Mianyang for treatment because of the limited local medical conditions.
Coinciding with Beichuan Tangjiashan Yan Sehu Ring Lake Road to carry out one-way traffic control, I would like to ask the traffic police to release the 120 first aid vehicles.
After receiving the call for help, the on-duty civilian police quickly reported the situation to the brigade. After a simple understanding of the situation, the commander-in-chief, Huang Xuemin, immediately arranged for the control point on-duty civilian police to contact the callers and asked them to make every effort to do a good job of escort.
"At that time, there were more than a thousand vehicles entering the controlled road, and after contact with 120 first aid vehicles, we are expected to arrive in Beichuan at about 15: 00, and we will immediately arrange for deployment."
Beichuan traffic police Yurie squadron captain Guan Wei said that the first aid vehicles need to go around the lake road from Tangjiashan Yan Sehu, and the road is steep and narrow. In order to prevent the vehicles that have already entered the road from running in parallel, the traffic police exercise segment control over the vehicles at the beginning, middle and end of the road one hour in advance, and remind all passing drivers to let the side of the road and wrong cars for the first aid vehicles.
Subsequently, the drum squadron civilian police also temporarily stopped the entry of vehicles into the control section, queuing for the arrival of the 120 first aid vehicles.
At around 1500 hours, an ambulance with a Chuan U licence entered the territory of Beichuan, and the Beichuan traffic police sent a police car to open the road and escort the first aid vehicle all the way into the controlled road.
It is understood that only one vehicle is allowed to pass in places on the loch road, which are temporarily controlled by the civilian police in advance, ensuring the smooth passage of 120 first-aid vehicles.
When they arrived at the village, there was a section of road that could not be wrong, so the traffic police made contact with the village two committees in advance, borrowed the village road to go around, and prohibited the entry of social vehicles.
"It took only 40 minutes from the Beichuan traffic police to receive 120 first aid vehicles to drive into the normal road of 302 provincial roads."
Guanwei said that, according to the normal situation, the whole passage time will take four hours.
"This arrangement has successfully secured valuable treatment time for the patient," he said
It is reported that at 1720 hours, the critically ill patient was delivered to Mianyang in time for treatment.

At 8.05 a.m. yesterday morning, two shoplifting suspects were captured while shoplifting from the 20 bus Yongding Gate Station to the Everest Station.

According to past experience, where the flow of people is concentrated, bus hubs and subway lines, including the people watching the flag-raising in Tiananmen Square, are key areas of their work.
In the flow of people, the civilian police in plain clothes calmly observed the passing crowd.
At more than 7 a.m., investigators who were crouching at the bus station found two suspicious men trailing a male passenger on a 20-way bus from Yongding Gate Station.
In the car, two suspicious men, one left and one right, sandwiched the male passenger in the middle, one of whom tried to give cover to the other.
But they did not know that their actions had long fallen in the eyes of the civilian police in plain clothes who were watching.
"Thief catch the spoils," civilian police in plain clothes pay attention to the fire, in the process of waiting for the men to commit the theft, the civilian police stare at the men who are preparing for the shoplifting, just after they pick up the hand, they are caught by investigators.
A reporter for the Beijing Morning News saw that the civilian police seized 800 yuan in cash from the theft suspect.
"The money was taken from the passengers' pockets."
"They cut it away and stole 800 yuan from a passenger who came to Beijing. When we caught them, the money had just been put into their own pocket," the civilian police said, pointing to a broken coat pocket.
The reporter learned that in order to catch the two men, the civilian police in plain clothes followed for an hour and finally caught them at the time of the crime.
The two suspects are currently under police scrutiny.
Civilian police in civilian clothes told reporters that the question of who was suspicious in the crowd was simple for the civilian police.
"When they catch more thieves, they will find that their eyes and looks are different from those of ordinary passengers. In addition to staring at people's pockets and backpacks, they also like to drill into the crowd rather than hide from people."
The civilian police also told reporters that the suspect waiting for the car often has no purpose, like to roam in the station, find the target of pickpocketing before he will follow the car.
"These are the rule of thumb, plain clothes have been doing so much for a long time, and it is natural to know
In addition, the civilian police also suggested that "the outer pocket is the most convenient and the most likely to be stolen."
You should pay attention to your belongings during your trip in order to prevent them from being stolen

British Prime Minister Theresa May on Sunday called on her party to unite in support of her Brexit plan, directly calling on critics to support it, saying that the free-trade deal they want is at the heart of her Brexit plan.
On September 30, 2018, British Prime Minister Theresa May went to a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, England.
At the start of the Conservative Party's spirited annual meeting, Theresa May's plan was again attacked by two former cabinet ministers, including former Foreign Secretary John Johnson, who called Theresa May's plan "deranged."
But she has also received strong support from other pro-Brexit ministers who have "praised Theresa May as one of the most polite people," with International Trade Secretary Fox and Foreign Secretary Hunt also pointing their anger at the EU.
Theresa May's already fragile leadership has come under further pressure this month, as the EU has rejected parts of the so-called "Chex" plan.
But Theresa May took a positive look at the consultations, saying she was prepared to consider the EU's misgivings.
"My message to my own party is for us to work together to find the best deal for the UK," said Theresa May.
Former British Foreign Secretary Johnson called Theresa May's plans "deranged" and slammed her for not having confidence in Brexit.
He and former Brexit Secretary David Davis are pushing for a Canadian-style free-trade deal with the European Union.
Theresa May, for her part, said the proposal would allow Northern Ireland to implement different tariff provisions, in the form of a division of Northern Ireland from the UK.

This News (intern reporter Li Qiyao) in recent years, there have been a number of incidents of non-conformity of the campus plastic runway.
To this end, the Ministry of Education has issued a circular requiring that surface sports sites for synthetic materials in primary and secondary schools to be delivered for use after November 1 this year must implement the new national standard.
The mandatory national standard, "Ground for surface movement of synthetic materials in primary and secondary schools," was organized under the leadership of the Ministry of Education and drafted with the participation of 26 scientific research institutes and testing institutions. After more than two years of revision, more than 100 expert meetings were organized during the period, as well as field visits and sample tests nationwide, and countless validation experiments were collected for the products of hundreds of enterprises on the market.
Compared with the old national standard in 2005, the reporter found that the new national standard not only changed from the "national recommended standard" to the "national mandatory standard," but also added a number of contents, including thickness requirements, physical performance, aging resistance, inorganic filler content requirements, anti-skid colloidal polymer content requirements, noxious material limits for surface products, and noxious material limits for non-solid and solid raw materials.
In particular, it is worth mentioning that the new national standard sets limits on the harmful substances that may be produced in the construction of plastic runways on campus, from 7 to 18, and provides for the limit of volatile organic substances on completed runways in accordance with the home installation standards.
For example, the release of hazardous substances is specified in the "Limits and odour requirements for hazardous substances in in-situ and prefabricated surface products," which requires that total volatile organic compounds should not be higher than 5 mg / m3, formaldehyde should not be higher than 0.4 mg / m3, carbon disulfide should not be higher than 7 mg / m3, benzene should not be higher than 0.1 mg / m3, and odour levels should not be higher than level 3.
The new national standard also makes detailed provisions on the sampling requirements, inspection rules and determination rules of plastic runways in primary and secondary schools.
In addition, the campus artificial lawn is also included in the national standard compulsory testing scope for the first time.
In the near future, all localities should carry out special work on the implementation of the new national standard, and submit the implementation of the new national standard to the Department of Sports, Health and Arts Education of the Ministry of Education within the year.

To activate rural consumption, we should rely on the normal mechanism to purify the market, guide the demand for healthy consumption, and enhance the sense of access to farmers' consumption.
The data show that the consumption potential of rural residents has continued to be released, and retail sales of rural consumer goods grew by 10.5 per cent in the first half of this year, 1.3 percentage points higher than in cities and towns.
A visit to a poverty-stricken village in a western county, the whole village has only one convenience store, into the store, some goods are familiar, "golden dragon fish" is marked "golden dragon oil," "Wangzi" has become "Wang milk," "shanzhai" a lot of goods.
Over the years, similar phenomena have frequently revealed that some rural fake and bad goods are close to famous brands, with similar names, similar packaging, false and false, so as to prevent them.
A consumption survey released by a city in the west shows that the problem of ultra-counterfeit goods in rural areas is serious, and 66 per cent of users have bought counterfeit goods in off-line supermarkets in towns and villages, with food accounting for more than half of them.
The relevant departments to clean up the rural market, shouting and beating every year, why "Li ghost" still do not fight again and again?
Unlike the urban market, the relatively weak awareness of farmers' rights, coupled with the remoteness of many rural areas and blind areas beyond the reach of regulatory forces, has created a breeding ground for counterfeit and inferior goods.
A commodity multi-head management, some departments to manage the price, some management production, some management of the market, cross-functional, year-on-year false, centralized management of a gust of wind, fake goods to escape the spotlight, slowly come out, just finished the old fake, new fake come out again.
The lack of a long-term supervision mechanism, the rural market is difficult to purify, the cost of breaking the law is low, and the benefits are large, so that some illegal traders have set up the crooked brain of "up and down the mountain," and some rural areas have become a "waste market."
From food and clothing to well-off, a large number of farmers are moving towards development-oriented consumption.
A few days ago, the Party Central Committee and the State Council issued a number of Opinions on perfecting the mechanism of promoting the consumption system to further stimulate the consumption potential of residents, which proposed to promote the upgrading of the consumption of rural residents, with the aim of enabling farmers to "consume" "willing to consume" and "dare to consume," so as to make rural consumption really strong.
On the one hand, we should deepen reform, eliminate the shortcomings of market supervision, multi-door and multi-head management, adapt to local conditions, improve the food safety and product quality supervision network, and constantly compress the space for making and selling fake products in rural areas.
On the other hand, we should step up law enforcement, open up the supervision of the "capillaries," and never allow fake and shoddy to breed and spread in the countryside.
The severe punishment of pit farmers is the protection of farmers. No matter how hidden they are, they should not be a reason for the breeding of counterfeit and inferior goods. The relevant departments should clarify their duties, the grass-roots regulatory forces are sinking, and when there is a problem, they should be investigated for responsibility, so that those who make or sell fake products have no place to hide.
We will strictly close the market access, carry out strict qualification examination of the production operators, clear the flow of the market, let the products come to the road, clear the road, find a way from the source and root, let the legitimate distributors operate safely, and let the farmers buy reassurance.
To activate rural consumption, we should guide the demand for healthy consumption.
With the escalation of consumption, many farmers not only seek to eat and eat well, but also to pursue a high-quality life, such as culture and health, and are unable to match the rural market with "low-quality" "cheap" paintings.
This requires promoting the extension of e-commerce coverage to a large number of rural areas, opening up the two-way linkage sales channels between urban and rural areas, promoting the integration of offline industrial development platforms and on-line e-commerce trading platforms, and supporting the expansion of the new mode of consumption into the rural market; promoting the organic integration of commercial logistics with leisure agriculture, rural tourism and product processing in eligible townships; and improving the modern rural circulation network system, optimizing the integration of stock facilities resources and effectively reducing the cost of rural circulation.
To create a clear and reassuring market environment for the countryside, so that farmers do not worry about their consumption, rural consumption can become more and more prosperous, so as to enhance the sense of access and well-being of farmers' consumption.
With effect from November 1, China will reduce the most-favoured-nation tax rate on some goods, and the total tariff level will be reduced to 7.5 per cent
In accordance with the decision of the 26th executive meeting of the State Council, the Tariff Commission of the State Council issued an announcement on November 30 to reduce the most-favoured-nation tax rate on some goods with effect from November 1, 2018.
According to the Notice of the Tariff Commission of the State Council on the Reduction of Import Tariffs on Some Commodities, with effect from November 1 this year, the most-favoured-nation tax rate on some industrial goods and other goods has been reduced in order to meet the needs of industrial upgrading, reducing the cost of enterprises and meeting the multi-level consumption of the masses.
A total of 1,585 tax items, accounting for about 19 per cent of the total number of tax items in China, the average tax rate fell from 10.5 per cent to 7.8 per cent, an average decrease of 26 per cent.
The tax reduction mainly relates to textiles; stone, ceramic and glass products; some steel and base metal products; mechanical and electrical equipment and spare parts, such as metal processing machinery, textile machinery, engineering machinery, transmission and transmission equipment, electrical equipment, instruments, etc.; and resource commodities and primary processing products, such as non-metallic minerals, inorganic chemicals, wood and paper products, precious jade, etc.
At the same time, with the reduction of the overall level of tariffs, especially the import tariffs on medicines and consumer goods for daily use, the tariff rate on import duties on imported goods has been reduced accordingly.
In order to implement the decisions of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, China has implemented zero tariffs on the vast majority of imported drugs with effect from May 1 this year, reduced import tariffs on cars, parts and components and some consumer goods for daily use with effect from July 1, and implemented the third step in the reduction of taxes on products covered by the information technology agreement.

The appropriate reduction of tariffs is conducive to the balanced development of foreign trade and the promotion of a higher level of opening up to the outside world. It is also conducive to the overall utilization of both international and domestic resources and the promotion of domestic supply-side structural reforms.
The person in charge of the committee said that this year marks the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up, and that the initiative to reduce the overall level of tariffs is a practical action to implement the spirit of Secretary-General Xi Jinping's important speech at the Boao Forum for Asia. It is also an important measure for China to further expand opening-up and expand imports in accordance with its high-quality development needs. This action and initiative shows that China will unswervingly pursue a mutually beneficial and win-win opening-up strategy and, while enhancing its own development drive, will also enable China's development to better benefit the world.

"Now that the pace of urban life is fast and stressful, more and more people are beginning to miss the rural life as a child, but," not to go back to the hometown, the most beautiful memory is the countryside, "Yang Qiaojia, a research expert on Chinese agricultural brands, said.
The climate conditions in Ring County are special, the sunshine time is long, the temperature difference between day and night is large, and the planting conditions of the characteristic small grain are unique.
There are more than 20 kinds of small grain in China. It is the land of small grain in China, with the highest production in Gansu and the highest quality in the country.

Canada's gross domestic product grew by 0.2 per cent in July from the previous month, a higher-than-expected increase, raising market expectations that the Bank of Canada will raise interest rates next month.
If it were to raise interest rates, it would be the central bank's fifth rate increase in a little more than a year.
Analysts interviewed by Reuters had previously forecast an increase of 0.1 per cent.
Statistics Canada said on Friday that 12 of the 20 industries had achieved growth.
The data is notable because the central bank predicted earlier this month that temporary factors could drag down the third-quarter GDP data.
Poloz, the president of the Bank of Canada, promised Thursday that the central bank would continue to gradually raise interest rates and would keep a close eye on economic data.
The Bank of Canada's next interest rate decision will be announced on October 24.
The Bank of Canada has raised interest rates four times since July 2017, owing to the strengthening of the Canadian economy and the near-record low unemployment rate.
Stephen Brown, a senior Canadian economist at Macro, said the economy is expected to grow at an annual GDP ring rate of about 2 per cent in the third quarter.
"This will be higher than the 1.5 per cent expected by the Bank of Canada, so it will be another reason to expect the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates next month," he said in a report.
The overnight index swap showed that the market's estimate of the probability of the Bank of Canada raising interest rates in October rose from 76.46 per cent to 78.27 per cent.
For the first time in 65 years, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea made a joint visit to
On May 5, the South Korean Defense Ministry confirmed that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea had launched a joint inspection of the waters of the Han River and the Jinjiang River into Haikou on the same day.
The initiative is a preliminary preparation to ensure the free navigation of civilian vessels on both sides.
A briefing provided to the media on the same day by the South Korean Defense Ministry showed that it was the first joint visit to the mouth of the Han River since the signing of the armistice agreement of the Korean War in 1953.
The Democratic People's Republic of Korea signed a military agreement in September and agreed to jointly visit waters such as the mouth of the Han River from November, so as to ensure environmental protection and tourism in the waters in the future.
In October, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea planned a joint inspection of the waters at a general-level meeting.
On November 5, a joint inspection of the waters of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was officially launched.
The joint mission was composed of 20 people, including the South Korean military and experts.
During the visit, members of both sides did not carry weapons and prohibited the use of words and actions to stimulate each other, South Korea's defense ministry said.
"Because there is no military demarcation line near the mouth of the sea, the area was a high incidence of accidents, but through joint visits, it will become a new peaceful area in the future," he said.
The waters jointly visited by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have a total length of about 70 km and a total area of about 280 square kilometers.
The South Korean Defense Ministry said the South Korean side will send six research vessels to explore the depth of the sea to provide basic information for safe navigation in the waters, and will provide navigation maps for civilian vessels to and from the waters once the investigation is completed.
The Democratic People's Republic of Korea held a summit meeting in Pyongyang in October 2007 to reach an agreement on the joint use of the Hanjiang River and the Jinjiang River into the sea, but the follow-up negotiations were stranded by tensions on the peninsula.
According to the military agreement signed by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in September, future vessels of the two sides will need to inform each other in advance before sailing in common waters.
Recently, Chinese citizens Guo Yuqin and Mao Runxin lost contact during a trip to Mongolia, according to the website of the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia on Nov. 4.
It is understood that the two were members of the Blue Sky Rescue Team. On October 19, they contacted relatives and friends in the country and said they were about to explore the mountains near Kusugur Lake and shared their location through a mini-letter. They have since lost contact and are suspected to have gone to no man's land.
The Chinese Embassy in Mongolia has always attached great importance to the protection of the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens in Mongolia and to the work of consular protection and assistance.
After learning of the news of the loss of the two tourists, the Embassy immediately launched the security emergency plan, in an effort to seize the golden rescue time and make every effort to carry out its work.
The Embassy maintained close communication with the families of the parties concerned, assisted the families in immediately reporting the case to the Mongolian police, and provided the families with a list of interpreters for their choice.
For the first time, the Embassy met with the heads of the Ministry of Foreign Relations, the General Police and the General Administration of Emergency Situations of Mongolia to inform them of the relevant situation, and asked the Mongolian side to carry out the search and rescue as soon as possible, and to maintain close communication with the Mongolian side throughout the search and rescue process, so as to ensure that the latest progress is kept up to date.
At the same time, the Embassy assisted the families in issuing a search notice in Mongolia, and widely mobilized overseas Chinese and Chinese enterprises in Mongolia to take an active part in the search, provide effective clues, and provided relevant assistance to a number of blue sky rescue team members who went to Mongolia to assist in the rescue.
Under the strong impetus of the Embassy, the Mongolian side sent a rescue team for the first time and promised to waive the cost of search and rescue.
The General Directorate of the Mont Police and the General Directorate of Emergency Situations instructed the police and emergency services in the province of Kousougur to make every effort to search and rescue.
As Lake Kusugur is located on the border between northern Mongolia and Russia, it is remote, sparsely populated and extremely inconvenient for transportation and communications. At present, Mongolia has entered a severe winter, with temperatures as low as about 20 degrees below zero, the local police and emergency services have overcome great difficulties, mobilized almost all the police, and mobilized local herdsmen to carry out day-to-day carpet search and rescue around their lost positions through horse riding, walking and visiting herdsmen.
At the same time, in response to the special situation of the pastoral area, the Mongolian side has been publishing a search notice through the radio cycle for many days.
The relevant staff of the domestic blue sky rescue team have also come to Mongolia and the Mongolian side to participate actively in the rescue.
The safety of the two disconnected people has always touched our hearts.
So far, the two have been lost for more than 10 days, the embassy has received a number of clues, but they have not yet been found, and the search and rescue operation is still under way.
The Embassy will always follow the principle of "putting people first," continue to pay attention to the matter, promote the Mongolian side to continue to make every effort to search and rescue, and provide maximum assistance to the families of the parties concerned.
The Embassy calls on compatriots and enterprises in Mongolia, if you know the relevant clues, please contact the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia for the first time.
