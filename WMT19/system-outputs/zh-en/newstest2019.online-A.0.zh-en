According to the British media, Admiral William Molin, Deputy U.S. Navy Operations minister, said that even as the US Navy was reviving its efforts to deal with the increasingly worrying Russia on both sides of the Atlantic, the United States continued to focus the Asia-Pacific region, the Pentagon, on expanding the region to include the Indian Ocean-Asia-Pacific-as the Navy.
According to the British "Jane's Defense Weekly" website reported on the September 24, the United States in the early year announced the new national defense strategy to list China and Russia as strategic competitors.
Since then, the United States Navy has restored its second fleet in order to confront Russian activities more directly.
The moves have raised some questions and concerns among allies and analysts who fear the U.S. Navy could stay away from the "Asia-Pacific rebalancing" strategy that marks the Obama administration, the report said.
But Admiral Moran said the U.S. Navy's focus remains on the western Pacific.
"There has been no major change for us," he said at a round-table discussion on January 24, 2018, hosted by the National Bureau of Asian Research in Washington called "Addressing the challenges of the high seas." ”
"The focus remains on rebalancing, shifting the center of gravity or describing it no matter how you want to," Moran said. ”
But he acknowledged that the United States has close ties to Europe.
"We will continue to focus on the growth of the West Coast and balance what we can do," he said. ”
While Moran noted that the overall policy on Russia falls within the purview of the U.S. Defense secretary, he warned: "The Russians may face demographic and economic challenges, but history has shown that if we clash with them, they will be very tough. ”
Admiral Moran said the U.S. Navy was dynamically deploying troops into a "new mode of warfare" as part of the U.S. comeback campaign against Russia, China and other contenders, which would help keep opponents off guard about where U.S. carrier battle groups or other assets would be deployed at any given time and place.
"Our Navy and Marines support it-the concept of operational unpredictability, and don't show up in the same place over and over again, almost like a clockwork-that's what we do," he said. ”
Reported that the first attempt to this new practice is the "Harry Truman" carrier Battle Group, the early deployment of the battle group includes working visits to the port and patrolling in areas that are usually only passed.
Moran said the U.S. Navy is now working to ensure allies know the warships will still patrol traditional areas and is also addressing logistical and family liaison issues for the new deployment process.
Lieutenant General Michael Noonan, commander of the Royal Australian Navy, also spoke at the event, saying the Australian Army could work seamlessly with the U.S. carrier battle group.
The situation will continue as the Royal Australian Navy plans to procure 9 more frigates equipped with the Aegis combat system, he said.

Similarly, there are many scientific and technological enterprises in the patent technology authorization, the use of patented technology and other aspects encountered a lot of infringement storm.
At the end of 2017, Tan Wei, He Zhanghong and Raibin from Guangdong Province, citing patent infringement, will be the developer of "drip travel" APP Beijing Orange Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Orange technology), operator Drip Travel Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Drip travel), sellers Guangdong Pacific Internet Information Service Co., Ltd.

Interview with chief executive officer of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research organization of Australia: significant results
"China's science and technology have developed rapidly over the past few decades, and the two countries have been able to achieve fruitful results in the field of science. ”
Larry Machel, chief executive of the Australian Federal Scientific and Industrial Research organisation, said in an exclusive interview with Chinese news agency in Beijing that cooperation between Australia and China in the field of science and technology has shown vitality, from tackling climate change to working with the Sky Eye Project.
As the largest national research institution in the Commonwealth of Australia, CSIRO has achieved many innovative research results in the world in the fields of oceans, energy, biology, materials, astronomy and so on.
CSIRO and the Chinese Academy of Sciences and other scientific research institutions have maintained a close relationship of cooperation.
"This is a lasting friendship that encompasses trust in partners and a tradition of long-term cooperation," he told the friendship. "Marshall said.
In May this year, China's 500-metre spherical radio telescope, "China Tian Eye", installed the world's first 19-beam L-band receiver.
The most advanced 19-beam feeder receiver in the world is jointly developed by Chinese and Australian scientists.
Marshall said the successful development of the receiver was based on CSIRO's years of technological accumulation, which will increase the speed of the FAST Sky survey by 5 to 6 times times, and will also expand more scientific observation targets.
"This is a force that CSIRO has contributed to FAST. ”
In addition to the above cooperation, CSIRO also has close cooperation with Chinese scientific research institutions in the construction of square Kilometre Array radio telescopes, the development of new fuel technologies, energy conservation and emission reduction.
"Previous scientific research has tended to focus on the problems of the last hundred years, and now more scientific research is needed to solve the problems that lie ahead." ”
According to Marshall, Australia and China are complementary in the field of scientific development, while both countries face a series of challenges in their development.
For example, extreme weather is frequent around the world, droughts and floods have led to a reduction in food production, and food shortages have seriously affected human development.
At the same time, population explosion, aging, chronic diseases and other issues are also facing serious challenges.
"The cooperation between Australia and China in recent years is mainly aimed at solving these current problems. ”
The International Southern Hemisphere Marine Research Center, built by CSIRO and the Qingdao National Laboratory of Marine Science and technology, focuses on observing the El Niño phenomenon and La Nina, studying the relationship between the two and extreme weather, and establishing early warning facilities for extreme weather, Marshall said , A new grain variety developed by CSIRO and the Chinese Academy of Sciences to overcome extreme weather could also alleviate food shortages caused by extreme weather.
"In the current environment, scientific and technological innovation is difficult to complete alone, the need for extremely high costs, there are a lot of problems to be solved, so cooperation is particularly important today." ”
Marshall said that the closer the cooperation, the more likely it is to make a breakthrough, which is also the significance of Australia and China to strengthen cooperation under the "One Belt, One Road" framework.
"The strengthening of bilateral cooperation is mainly for us in the area of scientific and technological cooperation. ”
Marshall said, for example, that CSIRO has recently developed a gold purification method that does not use cyanide, because the traditional cyanide gold purification method is very harmful to the environment, many countries hope to find a small way to purify the gold pollution.
"We are willing to introduce this technology into China, which is one of the results of our participation in the Belt and Road partnership. ”

North Korea's foreign Yonghao told the United Nations in Saturday that continued sanctions were deepening North Korea's distrust of the United States, and that North Korea could not unilaterally renounce nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Yonghao at the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea has adopted a "very friendly approach" over the past year, including halting missiles and nuclear tests, dismantling nuclear test sites and committing to the non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and technology.
"But we don't see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"There is no confidence in our national security if there is no trust in the United States, and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to give up our weapons unilaterally first. ”
While Yonghao is repeating North Korea's complaints about America's opposition to a "phased" denuclearization, his remarks are significant because there is no total rejection of unilateral denuclearization, as North Korea has done before.
Yonghao referred to Kim Jong Un and Trump's joint statement of June 12, when Kim Jong Un agreed to work toward "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula," while Trump promised to keep North Korea safe.
North Korea has sought to formally end the 1950-53-year war in North Korea, but the United States says North Korea must give up its nuclear weapons first.
The United States has also refused to ease demands for international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on ' denuclearization first ' and increases the pressure on sanctions to achieve their goals in a high-handedness manner, even refusing to issue a ' War End Manifesto '," Yonghao said.
"The idea that sanctions allow us to beg for mercy on our knees is that people who don't know us are daydreaming," he thought.
But the problem is that such continued sanctions are deepening our mistrust. ”
Yonghao did not mention the second special Money plan mentioned by the US President at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, he highlighted three meetings between Kim Jong Un and South Korean president Wen over the past five months, saying: "If the other side of denuclearization is South Korea rather than North Korea, then the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula will not become so deadlocked." ”
China has announced a reduction in import tariffs for 1585 tax purposes with effect from November 1, 2018.
So far this year, China has taken successive initiatives to reduce import tariffs.
On May 1 This year, the comprehensive tax reduction on drugs adjusted the import tariff for a total of 28 tax purposes, including anticancer drugs, and anti-cancer alkaloids, proprietary Chinese medicines with actual imports, to zero.
At the same time, it also significantly reduced the anti-cancer drug production, import link VAT tax.
July 1 Tax reduction on motor vehicles and parts for 218 tax purposes.
After tax reduction, China's automobile vehicle tax rate has been lower than the average level of developing countries, in line with the reality of China's automotive industry.
This tax reduction will promote the restructuring of the industry and the optimal allocation of resources, accelerate the survival of the fittest, help to improve the quality of products and services, is expected to promote car price adjustment to a certain extent, so that consumers get more benefits.
July 1 Tax reduction on consumer goods for 1449 tax purposes.
Tax reduction on consumer goods is closely related to the people's good living needs.
The tax reduction is not only numerous but also strong, with an average tax reduction of 56 per cent.
Consumer goods to reduce taxes, directly benefit the vast number of consumers, and promote domestic industries to improve competitiveness.
November 1 will be on the 1585 tax purposes of mechanical and electrical equipment, spare parts and raw materials and other industrial products to implement tax reduction.
Appropriate reduction of import tariffs on much-needed industrial goods in some countries can attract more foreign investment, help to increase domestic effective supply, help industrial upgrading, while helping enterprises to allocate resources on a global scale, reduce production costs, but also help to reduce the pressure of domestic environmental carrying.
According to the relevant officials of the Office of the Tariff and tariff Committee of the State Council of China, the above four autonomous tax reductions, as well as the third-step tax reduction implemented on July 1 this year under the outcome of the expanded negotiations on the information technology Agreement, will reduce China's total tariff level from 9.8% to 7.5 per cent a year earlier.
The adjusted total tariff level is slightly higher than that of the EU, lower than most developing countries, at a moderately low level, and largely matched with the status and stage of development of China's developing countries.
The person in charge said that as one of the important indexes of the opening degree of China's trade in goods, the total level of tariffs should be adapted to the stage of China's economic development and reflect the characteristics of the times.
China's trade in goods scale is the world's first, has a further expansion of the economic base, but the quality and efficiency of trade development compared with developed economies there is still a gap, therefore, the overall level of tariffs should be appropriately reduced.
Tariff is the protection means of compliance, tariff level should be compatible with industrial competitiveness, to encourage benign competition, excessive protection is not conducive to industrial development and improve quality.
Tariff rate adjustments should take into account production needs and consumer demand.

Serbia announces top operational readiness The president of the State will meet tomorrow to discuss the situation in Kosovo
Nantong News agency, citing the office of the President of Serbia, said that the Serbian president, Vucic, had ordered the country's armed forces to enter the highest operational readiness, given that Kosovo special forces had occupied access to the water storage Lake of the Gazivoda hydroelectric power station in northern Kosovo, which was controlled by Belgrade.
September 29 Serbian Defense Minister Wulin declared that the Serbian Army has entered a state of full combat readiness.
Wulin stressed that as long as the Vucic issued by the order remains in force, Serbia will continue to monitor the current situation in Kosovo, regardless of the direction of development,-SLA will respond.
On September 29, Vucic said in an interview that he had briefed the United States, Russia and Europe on the current situation and would travel to Moscow on October 2 to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to seek Putin's support on the Kosovo issue, Russia's Tass news agency reported.
Asked if Serbia needed to gain Russian military support like Syria, Vucic gave a negative response: "I don't want a major military conflict on our territory. ”
Vucic also said-SLA's entry into full combat readiness was only intended to create a deterrent to stop the conflict, but it was also a clear warning that any violence in Kosovo would never be tolerated.
-SLA's increased operational readiness is linked to two major moves on the Kosovo side.
According to the Serbian side, in recent days Albanians have been making extensive arrests in northern Kosovo of Serbs who have lived there for generations, and these arrested Serbs have not broken any laws.
Vucic stated that, since March 26 this year, the head of the Serbian Government office in Kosovo and Metohija, Marco Yurich, was beaten and detained by the Kosovo Arjun, ethnic Albanians have escalated the situation in the region, carrying out inhumane arrests and evictions of Serbs.
In addition, more than 100 people, including the ROSU special forces, armed police and snipers of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Kosovo, which have announced their own establishment, have occupied positions near the water storage Lake of the Gazivoda hydropower station, entered the ecological and sports centre near the dam in the northern part of the Kosovo region and cordoned off all nearby roads And these areas would have been controlled by the Serbian side.
Vucic pointed out that this military adventure in Kosovo was taken at the instigation of Western countries, and that the actions of the Kosovo Army did not inform the Serbian side in advance, in violation of the first paragraph of chapter nineth of the Brussels agreement, and in violation of the United Nations Security Council resolution 1244th and the military technical Agreement between Secco.
Vucic has shouted at Nato Secretary General Stoltenberg, criticizing the hypocrisy of Western countries on the Kosovo issue.
The root cause of the current conflict remains a hundreds of-year historical feud between the two communities in Kosovo.
With regard to the attribution of Kosovo, the Serb and Albanian communities have their own claims.
Serbia regards Kosovo as the birthplace of the nation and the cradle of culture, since Serbia established its most powerful country here in the 12th century, and Albanians moved in in large numbers only after the Ottoman invasion and-SLA defeat to the north.
The Albanians, for their part, insisted that the inhabitants of the primitive tribe, which lived in Kosovo for the 4-5 century BC, were the ancestors of the Albanians and that, as a result, Kosovo had been an ethnic Albanian territory since ancient times.
The subjective political division has resulted in fierce conflicts between different nationalities, religions and cultures, resulting in fierce antagonism between Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo.
Kosovo Albanians first declared Albania's independence in 1912.
After the First World War, the large number of Albanians living in the Balkans moved to Turkey, the relative increase in the proportion of Serbs, in the view of the Serbs "only to take back their own land" practice, but by the Albanians as "greater Serbian" plunder, the contradiction between the two communities intensified.
Kosovo became the "powder keg" of the Balkans.
The Kosovo war erupted in 1999 when armed clashes between Albanian separatists in the Kosovo Liberation Army and the Serbian Army and police led to the bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, composed of Serbia and Montenegro, by NATO forces.
Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia on February 17, 2008.
Since then, it has been reported that Serbia will normalize relations with Kosovo and sign a global and legally binding agreement, but due to historical ethnic feud and geopolitical constraints, the agreement of many forces, such as the United States, Europe and Russia, has not been signed.
And just one months ago, for the first time, Vucic made clear his claim to isolate Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo and once again make both communities open.

Brussels, September 28 – The EU took a non-confrontational stance against Italy in Friday after Italy flouted EU demands and surprised markets with a massive budget deficit plan, but the EU may take a more aggressive stance if Italy sticks to too bold a target.
Italy's Eurosceptic government aims to have a budget deficit of 2.4 per cent of gross domestic product over the next three years, suggesting that there is still no debt cut in the face of deficit reduction requirements alone.
"We have no interest in the crisis between the Executive committee and Italy," Moscovici, executive committee of the European Commission on Economic Affairs, said in Friday, "and he responded cautiously because the EU's proposals and sanctions may have little impact on Italy.
EU officials and diplomats still hope that market forces will persuade Italy to adjust its budget plan before Italy formally submits it to the EU Executive committee in October.
After the government announced its plans, the euro fell to its lowest level in nearly two weeks in Friday, while Italian bond yields hit their highest in three weeks.
If the deficit target remains unchanged by the October deadline, the EU executive committee could veto Italy's draft budget, something the Executive Board has never done to any country.
Domblovsky, vice chairman of the EU executive committee, later said at a conference in Riga, Latvia Capital, in Friday that Italy's current fiscal plan "appears to be at odds with the Stability and Growth Pact," referring to EU fiscal rules.
But he did not say how it would trigger a reaction from the EU.
Bidders can submit their applications to participate in this open tender by October 26 this year.

National Film-free cotton Live observation and seminar exchange activities experts into the test field, listen to the Chinese Academy of Engineering Shing Academician team representative briefing.
Beijing Shaya, September 30 (Shandan) is located in Shaya County, Xinjiang, the film-free cotton planting test base, film-free cotton growth is gratifying, and next to the film cotton compared to "no less", a cluster of snow-white cotton Race "open", hanging full of branches.
From September 27 to 28th, the National film-free cotton Live observation and seminar exchange activities were held in Shaya County, Xinjiang.
Reporters in the observation meeting learned that "Chinese cotton 619" and its supporting cultivation measures as the main body of the film-free cotton technology system, initially achieved the goal of non-membrane planting in cotton field, reduce the Xinjiang cotton field residual film on the ecological environment and raw cotton pollution, film-free cotton Comprehensive technology research and demonstration has made significant progress.
Academician Shing, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, a famous cotton genetic breeder and chief scientist of the cotton system of the national modern agricultural industry technology system, introduced the growth of film-free cotton to Zhou, party secretary of Zhejiang Agroforestry University.
"We have developed a combination of film-free cotton technology can fully achieve no film planting cotton, can completely solve the problem of residual membrane pollution, the realization of green cotton planting." ”
Introduction of Shing, academician of Chinese Academy of Engineering.
Xinjiang is China's most important cotton-producing area, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, Xinjiang cotton cultivation in 2017 is 35 million acres, accounting for 61 of the country's cotton area.
Since 1982, when the film was introduced into China, the covering area of all kinds of crops in Xinjiang has reached more than 50 million acres, and the annual use of mulch is about 300,000 tons.
Among them, cotton film cover rate reached 100 per cent, cotton field mulch accounted for about 60% of the use of film in Xinjiang.
Without membrane cotton for production measurement, cotton production can be achieved by 320 kg to 350 kg per mu.
With the increasing amount of film input in Xinjiang, the recovery rate of residual mulch is low, the amount of residual film in soil is gradually increasing, and the damage caused by residual membrane to soil structure is a series of problems, which seriously affects the sustainable development of agriculture.
The residual film not only causes serious pollution to the soil, but also has a great influence on the quality of cotton fiber.
At present, more than 1/3 of cotton fields in Xinjiang have achieved mechanized harvesting.
2017, Xinjiang Machine Cotton Mining area of about 14 million acres.
In the process of cotton harvesting, a large amount of shredded film on the surface and cotton strains, doped in raw cotton in the process of raw cotton processing is difficult to remove, in the subsequent textile processing process can not be completely removed, seriously affecting the quality of textile products.
September 28, the National film-free cotton Live observation and seminar exchange activities held in Shaya County, Xinjiang.
In order to solve the film pollution in cotton field, simplify cotton planting technology, improve the efficiency of cotton field, Shing led his team through 8 years, the implementation of "Cotton 619" film-free cotton technology planting, for Xinjiang agricultural green Development "add wings."
Shing introduced, through innovative breeding new ideas, the cultivation of special precocious, saline, low temperature resistance, high yield of the new line of land cotton "cotton 619".
"' Chinese cotton 619 ' under the condition of no film cultivation in southern Xinjiang, a series of supporting measures are realized, such as film-free seeding machinery matching, sowing depth improvement, shallow burial of drip belt under film free condition, suitable sowing density screening, reasonable chemical regulation and so on. ”
At present, Aksu, Kuller, Aral and other places to establish a film-free cotton demonstration base, production per hectare reached 4800 kg.
Without film planting cotton, the realization of high yield, an abridged version, environmental protection, comprehensive benefits improved.
Agricultural Science Institute agronomists Zhang Dong Hai, Third division of Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, said that through nearly 6 years of research and demonstration of film-free cotton cultivation techniques, the yield of film-free cotton seed cotton could be achieved by 320 kg to 350 kg per mu, or perhaps even higher.
"There is a great prospect for the promotion of film-free cotton cultivation techniques. ”
Zhang Dong Hai believes that at present, the cultivation technology of film-free cotton can completely solve the problem of soil residual membrane pollution, but there is still a certain gap between economic benefits and film cultivation.
"The support of cotton purchase price will be beneficial to the future promotion." ”
Shing said that the next step, he and his team will continue to carry out in-depth research on film-free cotton and widespread application, the film-free cotton industry bigger and stronger, and completely solve the problem of soil pollution caused by the film.

Wang Yi also stressed once again that China will certainly come out of a different development path from the traditional great powers.
This road with Chinese characteristics determines that China will not and cannot repeat the mistakes of the Guoqiang, and that China will neither become the United States nor challenge the United States, let alone replace the United States.
In a speech entitled "Opportunity or challenge, partner or opponent," Wang Yi said the deep crux of the problem is that some American friends believe that China will also be a strong bully, and will even challenge and replace the United States in the world's leading position.
"This is clearly a major strategic miscalculation. ”
But this self-imagining suspicion is spreading and amplifying existing contradictions, giving rise to new misgivings and making it more difficult and more resistant to solve specific problems between China and the United States, he said.
Wang Yi pointed out: China is taking a road of peaceful development.
The Chinese have never had the genes to expand abroad.
It is believed that countries can live in harmony and exchange and learn from each other.
Whether past, present or future, China will neither copy the foreign model nor ask other countries to replicate China's practices.
Earlier, when Wang Yi met with former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in New York, he said that Sino-US cooperation would be win-win and that confrontation would inevitably double lose.
China has always been committed to developing long-term healthy and stable Sino-US relations and achieving non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation.

According to foreign media reports, two small lions play together in a conservation center on the outskirts of Pretoria, South Africa's capital, and it's hard to see anything unusual, but they're unique.
The University of Pretoria declared: "This is the first young lion in the world to be born in the form of artificial insemination." ”
Scientists on campus are working on the reproductive system of female African lions.
Ganswint, director of the Institute of Mammalian Studies at the University of Pretoria, said the two young Lions born on August 25, one female and one male, were quite healthy and normal.
After 18 months of intensive testing, his team finally reached the breakthrough.
"We collect sperm from a healthy lion," Ganswint said in a media interview. ”
Next, the researchers and other female lions in the body of the hormone levels to achieve the appropriate level, for its artificial insemination.
"Fortunately, the results were successful," Ganswint said. ”
He said the researchers "made several attempts, but unexpectedly, it didn't take much effort."
He says the aforementioned study breakthrough repeatable verification, and scientists hope to use the technology to save large cats on the verge of extinction.
The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) noted that lions have been extinct in 26 countries in Africa, and that the total number of surviving wild lions has plummeted by 43 per cent in the past 20 years, with about 20,000 left.
The African lion is listed by the group as a dangerous animal.
"If we don't do something for this animal, they're going to be extinct," Ganswint said. ”
The new technology, he says, does not require lions to be raised, but simply injects sperm into the fertile lioness, as North America and Europe have done with captive elephants.
South Korea's exports fell the biggest in more than two years in September, but analysts blamed the decline on fewer days of work and said global demand for South Korean goods remained strong despite rising trade tensions between China and the United States.
Indeed, South Korea's average daily exports increased last month.
In addition, initial figures released earlier showed double-digit increases in exports in the first weeks of September before long holidays.
South Korea's September-year decline in exports was the largest since July 2016, down more than the 5.7 per cent decline estimated by 11 analysts surveyed by Reuters.
The initial values released in Monday show exports of $50.6 billion in September, down from $51.2 billion in August.
South Korea's exports to China rose 7.8 per cent in September, expanding for the 23rd month in a row, despite worries that rising U.S.-China trade disputes could lead to the suffering of other export-dependent Chinese neighbors.
South Korea's exports to the United States fell 11.8 per cent as sales of oil products slipped.
South Korean memory chips and overseas sales of petroleum products grew by 28.3% and 13.5 per cent, respectively, despite market worries that the so-called chip "super Cycle" may have peaked.
"However, the impact of trade conflicts will be difficult to avoid, as South Korea's exports rely heavily on the US and Chinese markets," he say. ”
Imports fell 2.1% to $40.8 billion, not as much as the Reuters survey estimated growth of 3.1 per cent.
The initial trade surplus in September was $9.7 billion, up from $6.9 billion in August.
According to the Ministry of Industry, Global manufacturing will remain buoyant thanks to the United States and EU countries, which is a good factor for South Korean exports.
"Higher export prices due to higher oil prices will also be good for exports in the second half of this year," the statement said. ”
"However, the continuation of the trade conflict between the United States and China, coupled with increased market volatility following interest rate hikes in the United States, is a negative pressure on exports. ”
The average number of exports per working day increased to $2.6 billion in September and $2.1 billion in August.
South Korea's mid-Autumn festival fell in September 24 to 26th, so there were only 19.5 working days in September, four days less than in the same period last year.
South Korea's exports grew 4.7 per cent in January-September from a year earlier.

North Korean media criticises us for not loosening sanctions against North Korea
North Korea's Labor news published a signed op-ed on the September 30, criticizing the United States for not easing sanctions against the DPRK while seeking dialogue with the DPRK, calling it a "paradoxical" approach.
The article said that the United States Secretary of State Ponta Pompeo 14th said that "in order to achieve the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, the key is to meet the sanctions against the DPRK," stressing that the United States continue to implement the United Nations sanctions resolution position unchanged.
In Singapore's DPRK-US joint statement, the two sides pledged to establish a new DPRK-US relationship commensurate with the aspirations of the Chinese and American peoples for peace and prosperity.
It is no doubt paradoxical for the United States to step up its sanctions crackdown and demand dialogue.
The article said that if we want to establish a new DPRK-US relations, build a permanent and consolidated peace System on the Korean peninsula and achieve the complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, we should put the construction of trust in the first place, starting from what can be done and solving it in stages.
The article also said the United States should understand that sanctions repression will not work for North Korea.
Even the "North Devon" before the "Kazan" was lauded by the US military, the article said.
"We will meet strong potential adversaries," the National interest magazine quoted the US Navy as saying. It's enough to just look at the ' North Devon ' submarine. ”
Fogo, the current commander-in-chief of the US military in Ohaijun, also praised the "North Devon" submarine.
"This submarine is impressive," he said. A look at the development of the Russian Navy and the use of resources will know that its main effort in research and development is, first and foremost, to strengthen the submarine fleet. ”
But national interest magazine still believes the United States maintains an advantage over Russia in this area.
"I believe that Western countries still have asymmetric advantages," Fogo said. ”
It comes after it emerged that the Russian navy will list the "Kazan" submarine in 2019.
"Kazan", "Novosibirsk", "Krasnoyarsk", "Arkhangel'sk" multi-purpose submarines are "white wax tree-M" improved type, displacement of 13800 tons, dive depth of 520 meters, staffing 64 people, underwater speed 31 knots, will carry mines, torpedoes and "caliber" and "Onyx" Cruise missile.

Ignore the American threat!
EU may enter into crude oil purchase agreement with Iran
The U.S. government has claimed it will restart a new round of sanctions against Iran in November and even urge other countries to reduce imports of Iranian oil.
America's allies, though, don't seem to listen.
On 29th, Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif revealed that Tehran was approaching an agreement with the European Union on the sale of crude oil, despite threats from the United States to sanction any country doing business with Iran, the New York Times reported.
The central purpose of the agreement is to try to create a new payment mechanism that replaces dollar trading in the form of barter or local currency pricing.
The aim of the approach is to bypass the United States and prevent the United States from hindering financial transfers.
Meanwhile, while the EU is working to broker the deal, some French and British officials are concerned that, if the deal is met, it would be the most open confrontation between the EU and the United States, which opposes a US exit from the Iran nuclear deal.
In an exclusive interview for one hours, Zarif's words sounded more optimistic than in recent months, the US media said.
Because the agreement has the ability to "divest" America's traditional allies and effectively break the US attempt to cut Iran's revenues.
"This will ensure that we sell oil and benefit," Zarif argued, arguing that countries have a legitimate right to trade with Iran under an agreement reached in 2015.
Federica Mogherini, the EU's foreign policy chief, has also said that "no sovereign State or organization can accept other people to decide who they can trade with." ”
However, she also predicted that before the US government launched its next sanctions in November, it would be possible for US leaders to adopt a range of financial instruments aimed at targeting banks, businessmen and countries that have business dealings with Tehran.
In May of this year, the U.S. government unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, citing flaws in the deal, saying it could not permanently ban Iranian production of nuclear fuel.
The US side then threatened to ban companies that buy Iranian oil and other goods from doing business in the United States.
The threat led to the withdrawal of some companies from Tehran and the collapse of Iran's currency.
Companies such as Airbnb and French oil giant Total have canceled billions of of dollars in investment in Iraq.
British and French officials have said the U.S. government could "prevail."
Sure enough, according to a recent Turkish media report, the US sanctions do not appear to have had a significant impact on Iran's oil exports.
No other country but South Korea has stopped buying Iranian oil, Iran's oil minister, Zangane, has revealed.
Both Zarif and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani argue that the purpose of a series of US actions is to "tempt" Iran into violating the agreement.
Zarif was also dismissive of the US side's spate of verbal attacks, and when asked if the United States would overturn the current Iranian government with increasing financial pressure, Zarif even laughed, "it is a tactic of regime change, and that is the real purpose of the US side." ”

Nagoya, November 5 – Bank of Japan President Haruhiko Kuroda said in Monday that the central bank was aware that long-term ultra-loose monetary policy could squeeze the profitability of financial institutions and could destabilize the country's banking system.
But he said the Bank of Japan needed to maintain its massive stimulus package in light of low inflation and uncertainty in overseas economies, while keeping a close eye on the pros and cons of its policies.
"The Bank of Japan fully acknowledges that the strength of financial institutions will be increasingly affected by continued monetary easing," Mr Kuroda said in a speech to business leaders in Nagoya.
He said the banking system could be volatile in the event of a serious negative shock if financial institutions were more active in taking risks to make up for the narrowing of profit margins caused by years of low interest rates.
"While these risks are not significant at the moment, the central bank will keep a close eye on developments and encourage financial institutions to take the necessary steps," he said.
The minutes of the Bank of Japan meeting, published earlier in Monday, show that at the September meeting, the Bank of Japan's policy committee discussed the rising cost of long-term easing.
The minutes show that if the economy continues to expand, "The Bank of Japan has more room for flexibility in terms of policy in the future," a member said. ”
The minutes showed another member said the committee should discuss how long the bank of Japan could maintain the stimulus policy, given its limitations during the duration of the policy.
Mr Kuroda said the Bank of Japan would assess the financial risks posed by easing, while also taking into account the uncertainty surrounding Japan's economic outlook, which could affect global demand because of Sino-US trade frictions and rising protectionism.
"The impact of such problems on the Japanese economy is limited for the time being," Mr Kuroda said.
"But how the problem persists, the impact on the Japanese economy is likely to get bigger," he added.
"There is a need for sustained strong monetary easing, while considering both positive and negative impacts in a balanced manner," Kuroda said.
While the drawbacks of the radical stimulus package have increased, such as long-term low interest rates eroding the profits of financial institutions, the slump in inflation has forced the Bank of Japan to maintain the plan.
The Bank of Japan last month maintained monetary policy; Mr Kuroda ruled out the possibility of a recent rate hike in the face of the risks posed by a global trade war dispute.
June 1, 2018, Cardiff, USA, the corporate logo on Tesla electric vehicles.
Under a settlement, U.S. Tesla Motors and its chief executive, Musk, have agreed to pay a 20 million-dollar fine to financial regulators, and Musk will step down as chairman of the company but still as CEO.
The settlement will put an end to the turmoil that has lasted two months for Tesla.
Investors are relieved by the securities Fraud allegations settlement agreement revealed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in Saturday.
Investors had feared that the protracted legal battle would only further crack down on the still-loss-losing electric car company.
The SEC sued Fox for fraud in Thursday, saying its August 7 tweet misled investors.
He is considering privatizing Tesla for $420 per share and has received financing, the tweet said.
The SEC said the tweets were virtually unfounded and that the market turmoil it triggered had damaged investors.
Investors and corporate governance experts say the deal could boost Tesla, which has been hammered by its recent actions.
Steven Heim, head of Boston Common Asset Management, said the settlement should give Musk more oversight and did not take "devastating" measures to drive him out of Tesla.
The asset management company holds shares in Tesla's battery maker Panasonic.
Under the proposed agreement, Tesla would have to appoint an independent chairman, two independent directors and a board of directors to develop controls over the external communication of Maersk.
"It is in the best interests of our market and our investors, including Tesla shareholders, that the matter is resolved quickly on the agreed terms," SEC chairman Clayton said in a statement.
The Thursday allegations led to a evaporation of about $7 billion in Tesla's market capitalisation, which was $45.2 billion in Friday and less than GM's $47.5 billion.
In the settlement, the SEC withdrew its request to drive Musk off the company's palm.
Many investors claim the penalty would be disastrous.
"I think it's the best possible outcome for all those involved," said Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial Partners, Feinseth gave Tesla a "neutral" rating and said the SEC penalty was a "lighter punishment" for musk.
"It's important for Tesla that he still serves as CEO. ”
Neither Musk nor Tesla acknowledged or denied the SEC's allegations in the settlement and did not immediately return a request for comment.
The settlement agreement still needs to be approved by the court.

During the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, the parties released some positive messages around the Korean peninsula issue.
South Korean president Wen relayed the DPRK's "irreversible" determination to abandon the nuclear and said U.S. President Trump and North Korea's top leader, Kim Jong Un, could meet by the end of the year.
The State Department later said Secretary of State Ponta Pompeo would visit North Korea in October to push for the implementation of the U.S.-DPRK leader Singapore meeting commitment.
From the beginning of this year to the present, the DPRK and South Korea to break the ice to open the road of dialogue, inter-Korean and DPRK-US leaders met, the situation on the peninsula to ease the general trend to continue, dialogue to resolve the issue of the peninsula principle has been upheld.
First of all, the "nature of the peninsula issue is a security issue" this has not changed, the key to achieving peace on the peninsula is to properly and balance the reasonable security concerns of all parties, rather than simply pressuring the other side and blindly emphasizing their own claims.
Secondly, in the dialogue to realize the denuclearization of the peninsula, the parties concerned are divided on the steps and ways to realize the denuclearization of the peninsula, because of the long-standing lack of political trust between the DPRK and the United States, the "who first who after" game thinking is still strong.
At a recent open meeting of the Security Council on the Korean Peninsula at United Nations Headquarters in New York, the different voices of the parties around the issue of sanctions against North Korea have once again highlighted the two points on the peninsula that have "not changed".
U.S. Secretary of State Ponta Pompeo insists that sanctions against North Korea will not be lifted until the Korean peninsula is fully denuclearization.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, for his part, stressed the principle of "responding to action with action", noting: "The weakening trend of sanctions should be synchronized with the pace that North Korea has taken on the road to phasing out its nuclear."
There is no doubt that the parties concerned should continue to implement the Council's resolution on the DPRK in a comprehensive, complete and accurate manner, but pressure is not an end, the implementation of sanctions and the promotion of a political settlement are the requirements of Security Council resolutions, and they human beings not be the only one.
As China's State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, in view of the current positive developments in relations between the two Koreas and the DPRK and the United States, China believes that it is necessary for the Council to consider initiating reversible clauses in due course, thereby encouraging the DPRK and all parties concerned to take greater steps towards denuclearization.
Looking back on the past, the denuclearization of the peninsula and every progress in the peace process require sufficient political courage on all sides.
At present, in the face of the increasingly high expectations of the international community to promote a political solution to the problem on the peninsula, all parties concerned should, in particular, show political courage, make political decisions, implement commitments, resolve difficult problems, continue to take steps towards the denuclearization of the peninsula and establish a peace mechanism on the peninsula, and jointly create a permanent peace on the peninsula.

The survey raises questions about the Bank of Japan's view that robust economic expansion will help push inflation to an accelerated 2% per cent target, despite signs that companies are gradually passing on costs to customers.
"In the context of concerns raised by the global trade war, the confidence of manufacturers has stagnated as a result of slowing exports and weak factory production," said Nanwuzhi, lead researcher at the Institute for the aggregation of agroforestry.
"Confidence is still high. And as corporate profits are improving and prices are rising, I don't think confidence will continue to slide. ”
The short-term survey showed that the September large manufacturing industry boom judgment Index fell from a positive 21 three months ago to a positive 19, worsening for the third consecutive quarter.
The estimated median value for the market is positive 22.
The September large non-manufacturing boom judgment index fell from a positive 24 survey in June to a positive 22, worsening for the first time in eight quarters.
The Reuters survey is positive 22.
According to the survey, the boom judgment index of large manufacturing and non-manufacturing industries in December was expected to remain stable.
Investors do not care about the decline in the short-view corporate boom judgment Index, the Japanese Nikkei index. N225 rose to its 27 high in Monday as the yen continued to depreciate to help improve the export earnings prospects of Japanese companies.
Capital expenditure is solid.
Despite a decline in business confidence, the latest short view highlights the soundness of corporate capital spending plans, thanks to renewed capacity and increased investment in robotics and automation to cope with a labor shortage caused by an ageing population.
Large companies plan to raise capital spending by 13.4 per cent this fiscal year in March 2019, according to the central bank's short-view survey.
13.6 per cent at the time of the previous short-view survey.
South Takeshi said all corporate capital spending plans rose 8.5 per cent this fiscal year, close to the pace of Japan's bubble economy.
"There is still room for further growth in capital spending in view of the increase in earnings forecasts from now on, but much depends on the impact of trade wars on business confidence," he said. ”
The short-term survey shows the increased ability of companies to pass on costs, with large corporate output price indices at 7, a decade-old high, an encouraging sign of progress in Japan's efforts to combat deflation.
The index, which measures the employment status of large companies, hit minus 23, the most tight level since 1992, highlighting the tightening of the job market.
Benefiting from strong corporate spending, Japan's economy rebounded in the second quarter from its contraction in January-March this year.
But the summer trade friction escalated and the supply chain was disturbed by natural disasters, making Japan's economic prospects dependent on exports Mengyin.
In United States dollars, the growth rate of services in exports is 16.4 per cent.

Today, in China's open landmark Shanghai, the world's first import-themed large-scale national exhibition-China International Import Expo, in the expectation of the official curtain.
An exhibition is like a "window" that allows the world to better understand a city and a country.
Through the "window" of the expo, people see the move towards a higher level of "open China", with the help of the "window" of the expo, welcome the world and "reform and opening up again" of China's mutual benefit and win-win situation.
"For a country, opening up is like breaking a cocoon into a butterfly, and although it will go through a moment of pain, it will come in exchange for a new life." ”
General Secretary Xi Jinping's summary of the road to openness explains an important reason for "why China Can".
Looking back on the 40 years of reform and opening up, China, which dares to plunge into the world market, has encountered swirls and storms, but has always faced all risk challenges with an open posture, constantly releasing endogenous momentum and continuously improving its competitiveness.
It can be said that China with its own solid achievements, a strong interpretation of the value and significance of openness.
Standing at a new historical starting point, holding an import-themed exposition is a major decision taken by the CPC Central Committee, with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, to promote a new round of high-level opening to the outside world, a major initiative of China's initiative to open its markets to the world, a practical action by China to support economic globalization and trade liberalization, and a demonstration China's open doors will not be closed, but will only open up the larger "strong and clear will."
And exhibitors from all over the world, the booth "a difficult to ask", is to China in a larger scope, a wider field, a deeper development of an open economy of the greatest affirmation and best response.
More importantly, the current global economic and trade order has reached a crossroads.
The construction of protectionist walls and the return of the old path of unilateralism in some countries have increased the international community's concern about the prospects for free trade and added a lot of uncertainty to the recovering world economy.
In the context of this era, the event on the banks of the Huangpu River reflects China's defense of free trade, allowing the world to see open markets, share the future of China's self-confidence and China's commitment.
Walk Alone fast, the crowd goes far.
China's open mind and embrace of the world have not only strongly promoted its own development, but also brought surging "opportunities for China" to countries and regions around the world.
In recent years, advocating and promoting the construction of the "Belt and Road", the launch of the AIIB, the establishment of Silk Roads Fund ... China offers a range of international public goods, providing real export markets, development opportunities and jobs, allowing companies from all over the world to take China to develop "express cars".
The Expo is also such a public product, a big platform for global economic and trade cooperation.
On top of this platform, more than 3,000 companies in more than 130 countries and regions, with unique quality products and services shining on the stage, to take a new step in the Chinese market.
In addition to national enterprises, there are domestic consumers who really benefit.
By setting up this "preferably excellent" platform, for the consumption upgrade to provide a multi-channel high-quality supply, to meet the people's personalized, diversified, differentiated consumption needs.
As the door of China's opening opens up, the smooth flow, make the most of it, and move towards a better life will be more solid.
From a more macroscopic point of view, the significance of the Expo has gone beyond the scope of economy and trade, but rather to the future, to convey the concept of openness, tolerance, inclusion, balance and win-win, and to form a common understanding to meet today's challenges.
The world is good, China can be good, China is good, the world is better.
We look forward to the expo to bring the world wonderful and complete, we are more looking forward to the higher level of "open China" and the world to work together to build a glorious future of the community of human destiny.

Despite the continuing turmoil in global financial markets, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said in Monday that the Exchange Fund's investment income in the third quarter of this year had been reduced by 97% per year, but better than in the previous quarter, as overseas equities had risen significantly under the Sino-US trade war and foreign exchange losses had also narrowed markedly.
According to the latest figures of the HKMA, the Exchange fund recorded investment income of HK $1.6 billion in 2018 7-September, which was significantly lower than HK $61.8 billion in the same period last year, but better than the revised HK $100 million in the second quarter of this year.
Mr Chan, chief executive of the HKMA, said in the Legislative Council that the Hong Kong and emerging markets stock indices ran counter to the U.S. stock index at the beginning of the Sino-US trade war, and that market sentiment began to reverse until the end of September and early October, when the US equity index peaked, as investors became aware that the trade war was also detrimental to the United States itself
"A change in market sentiment is a good thing, and if a trade war has only a unilateral effect, it doesn't help much to solve things," he told. ”
But he also noted that "if the Sino-US trade war is not resolved, financial market volatility will continue to rise." ”
In the third quarter of this year, the Exchange fund's stock investment losses in Hong Kong narrowed by 8% to HK $4.7 billion from the previous quarter, while overseas equity investment income increased by 172% to HK $12.8 billion, foreign exchange losses of HK $16.2 billion, bond yields of HK $9.7 billion and a quarter reduction of 24% and 31 per cent, respectively, This mainly reflects the general rise in the United States dollar against major currencies in the quarter and the rise of the US yield to 3 levels in September.
The Exchange fund is mainly used to support the Hong Kong dollar.
Hong Kong has been implementing a pegged peg to the United States dollar since 1983.
With regard to the current financial situation in Hong Kong, Mr Chan said that economic and asset market uncertainty had increased and downside risks were increasing, but Hong Kong's financial system was robust and defensive and had ample seismic capacity.
"Hong Kong has an abundant international investment position, with a foreign net asset value of $1.4 trillion trillion of 4 times times GDP, 2.5 times times higher than Singapore and 0.6 times times that of Japan, and is more than enough to cope with the downturn or reversal. ”
With the recent decline in Hong Kong dollar rates and the widening of the spread with the US dollar, Mr Chan pointed out that the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate had risen by more than 400 basis points on September 21 and was widely believed to be related mainly to the rise in Hong Kong dollar Since then, the Hong Kong dollar has lingered at a level near 7.80-7.84, and the recent decline in Hong Kong dollar interest rates and the widening of the spread between the United States dollar may attract the market to sell Hong Kong dollars and increase the interest rate on the dollar, making the Hong Kong dollar more likely to trigger weaker party exchange guarantees again than in the previous period.
However, he believes that with the start of the cycle of interest rate hikes in Hong Kong and the normalization of US dollar interest rates, future Hong Kong dollar interest rates will change below the dollar rate.
"The trend in Hong Kong dollar interest rates and US dollar interest rates will be more consistent, and we must be more careful in managing risks and preparing them to cope with market volatility." ”
Due to the abundant capital of Hong Kong dollar, the Hong Kong dollar interest rate fell further, the three-month interest rate decreased by 0.9% to 2.08179 per cent in Monday, from 46 basis points to 51 basis points in the United States dollar, and the one-month rate was a five-month low, with the United States dollar spread extending from 120 basis points to 127 basis points.
From May to September, the Hong Kong dollar spot rate was close to 7.85 to USD 1.
During this period, the weak party exchange guarantee was triggered several times in May and August after it was first triggered in April, as a result of factors such as hedging activities and the outflow of funds from part of the IPO after the completion of the large prospectus.
The HKMA bought the Hong Kong dollar and sold US dollars at 7.85 levels under the linked exchange rate system to maintain the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate.
The HKMA bought a total of about HK $52.1 billion under the weak party exchange guarantee mechanism in May and August.

Hong Kong, November 5 – Hong Kong property prices fell for two consecutive months after peaking, and Mr Chan, President of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, said in Monday that time was still needed to see if the property market had entered a downward cycle and, if so, to consider easing the tightening of countercyclical measures in due course.
Mr Chan also pointed out that if property prices were to be reversed, it would be the people who would be the first to buy a home at the peak of the housing market, but the chances of a sharp fall in property prices, such as the 1997 Asian financial turmoil, and a large price cut by the public to sell properties would be much lower.
Mr Chan led a number of senior members of the HKMA to attend the Legislative Council briefing, he said that if the property market was confirmed to have entered a downward cycle, measures could be relaxed in due course.
"But with only a few weeks of data, it is still too early to relax and it will take more time to see if the housing market is in a downward cycle," he asked. ”
Since 2009 10, the HKMA has so far introduced eight rounds of counter-cyclical measures to significantly tighten mortgages for various types of properties, including reducing the mortgage ratio and requiring mortgage applicants to pass rigorous stress tests to enhance bank risk management and earthquake resistance.
As Hong Kong officially entered the cycle of rate hikes, the Hong Kong private residential Property price index peaked for two consecutive months in August-September, and the monthly decline in September widened to 1.44 per cent.
But the cumulative increase in the first three quarters of this year was still 10.2 per cent.
According to the HKMA, the financial situation of households measuring the seismic capacity of Hong Kong in the face of financial risks is still healthy, and in the second quarter of this year, the ratio of home-based households without mortgages in Hong Kong reached 66 per cent, which is higher than the average of 60% in 2009-11, with an average mortgage number of new mortgages and a contribution and income 47% ratio of new And 34 per cent, compared with 64% and 41% in 2009-11, respectively, there was a marked improvement.
However, Mr Chan said that the high seismic capability does not mean that the people who have already bought a home will not be harmed by the downside of the economy, as property valuations will fall and those who buy flats at peak times will bear the brunt.
Although the HKMA has tightened banks ' lending to mortgage lenders, home buyers can also obtain high levels of mortgage lending through mortgage insurance or mortgage loans provided by developers.
Mr Chan said that with the mortgage loan provided to the developer, the borrower's mortgage ratio could reach 85-90 per cent, and if property prices fell by 10%, there would be negative equity (that is, the market value of the properties would fall below the level of the total outstanding mortgage loan).
However, the deputy chief executive of the HKMA, Mr Nguyen, pointed out that the administration estimated that the total amount of mortgage provided by the developer would account for only 2-2.5 per cent of the total bank mortgage and that the proportion would still be low.
During the peak period of negative equity in Hong Kong in 2003, there were more than 100,000 negative equity cases, representing 22 per cent of the supply floor.
As of the third quarter of this year, Hong Kong recorded 0 negative assets in seven consecutive quarters.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic and difficult disease involving multiple organs throughout the body and has been considered an "incurable condition" in the past.
Because of its unknown pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of problems, lack of effective treatment methods and not to cure.
Recently, Liu Wanri, a researcher at Tsinghua University's School of Life Sciences, and Lijiangou, director of the Rheumatic Immunization Center at Peking University People's Hospital, found that human immunoglobulin has molecular variations that increase susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus, and that this variation is involved in regulating immune B cells.
In short, the two teams have confirmed that an abnormal immune molecule in the body is an important cause of systemic lupus erythematosus.
According to one of the authors and Sun Xiaolin of Peking University People's Hospital, the Lijiangou team collected nearly 2000 large samples of systemic lupus erythematosus patients and studied it, and found that patients with immunoglobulin variation produced pathogenic cells and a wide variety of autoantibodies, nephritis, arthritis, serous inflammation, The incidence and severity of inflammation, such as vasculitis, increased significantly.
Through various research methods such as immune cell tracer, animal test and sequencing, Liu Wanli team found the immune signaling pathway activated by immune molecular variation and the pathogenesis of promoting B cells to secrete a variety of autoantibodies.
Reporter learned that the two teams strong joint, give full play to their respective advantages, to achieve the basic research and clinical application of the close combination.
Liu Wanli Team is committed to B lymphocyte immune identification, immune activation research, Lijiangou team has long been engaged in systemic lupus erythematosus clinical research.
"This study is one of the results of years of collaboration between two teams, and it is the first time in academia that the mechanism has recognized that immunoglobulin gene abnormalities will induce systemic lupus erythematosus, laying a solid foundation for further academic research and clinical targeted therapy. ”
This is not short protection, but acting in accordance with the law.
The lawyer was sitting in court with an axe?
The news was really exciting at first glance and blew up the pot in the legal circle.
Fujian Quanzhou then fined 500 yuan to the lawyer involved, and recommended in writing that the Quanzhou Bar Association conduct an investigation and deal with it.
According to the Beijing News reported that a few days ago, the Quanzhou Law Association issued an official notice that the actions of two lawyers do not involve illegal violations, no punishment in accordance with the law.
From the multi-party report, Quanzhou Law Association's treatment is not short protection or confrontation, but has been recognized by the Quanzhou Central Court.
An event that could have sparked tension within the legal community and was eventually properly resolved.
The reversal of the matter stems from a more complete truth reduction: The axe carried by the lawyer is the same style, the same model as the defendant's murder weapon, but not the blade, only in the proof of evidence link to provide supporting proof, and there is no intimidation or "endangering the safety of the court" subjective intention.
There are four very important details to judge whether the conduct of the lawyer in question is illegal or not: first, the local Court has held two previous sessions, showing only the axe photos, from a defence point of view, it is necessary to produce the original axe; second, the axe is purchased 1 hours before the hearing, not the lawyer does not want to seek the judge's consent, But objectively failed to reach the judge; third, the entire axe was not used too aggressively or improperly; its four, the lawyer involved the first time publicly admitted the mistake, and apologized to the court.
Combining these circumstances, it can be seen that the lawyer involved "appearing in court with an axe" has nothing to do with it, just to defend.
After clarifying the whole facts, the Quanzhou Law Association did not push, but stood up to the pressure to make a decision not to punish.
And that decision, too, stood the test of facts and laws.
As for bringing the axe as a control cutter to the court without the permission of the Court, it is indeed easy to arouse unease and misunderstanding.
Due to safety and careful consideration, the previous fine penalty and judicial advice of Quanzhou Central Court are also beyond reproach.
In order to preserve the dignity of lawyers and prevent individual courts from harassing lawyers, the supreme law issued the rules on security checks for judicial police in the people's courts in 2014, establishing the principle that lawyers do not need to carry out personal safety checks in court.
Since the release of the rule, a wide range of lawyers have led by example, with few incidents that have endangered the security of the court due to security breaches.
In very few cases like Quanzhou, misunderstanding is not difficult to eliminate as long as communication is carried out in a spirit of mutual respect and understanding.
As a self-discipline organization of the lawyer Industry, the Bar Association undertakes the dual mission of punishing lawlessness and safeguarding legality.
In the past, individual Law association organizations were criticized for their emphasis on discipline and their loss of protection.
The decision of the Quanzhou Law Association, both in terms of process and results, is commendable, setting an example for more law associations to perform their duties correctly.
From October 1, which tax profits good will affect our pocketbook?
Shanghai, October 1 (Xinhua) The new Personal income tax law will come into effect on January 1, 2019, and in order to allow the broad masses of the people to enjoy the tax relief dividend as soon as possible, from October 1, the income from wages and salaries actually obtained by taxpayers will be deducted at the threshold of 5000 yuan per month, and the new tax scale shall be applied.

It is worth noting that the new basic deduction fee and tax scale can be applied to the wages that should have been paid in October by the units at the end of September due to holidays.
To this end, the tax department unified promotion of the use of withholding client software has provided the corresponding tax calculation function, but the corresponding tax still need to be declared and paid during the statutory filing period.
Positive two: Low tax pitch significantly widening
In addition to raising the threshold, a new tax schedule will be applied from October 1 onwards.
The seven-tranche tax rate on wages and salaries has remained consistent and unchanged, but there has been a marked change in the tax rate, with a marked increase in the level of 3 per cent, 10 per cent, 20% third-tier low tax rates, a reduction in the tax level of 25% per cent, and a level of higher tax rates of 30, 35 per cent and 45%.
It is worth noting that the tax law also adjusts the tax rates earned by production and operation, of which the lower limit of the most upscale 35% tax rate is increased from 100,000 yuan to 500,000 yuan.
This means that individual industrial and commercial households and sole proprietorship partnerships will benefit from the tax reform.
"From the early stage of the calculation of individual tax cuts for Shanghai taxpayers, the vast number of taxpayers will fully feel the dividends of a tax reform, especially the reduction of tax cuts for low-and middle-income people. ”

Since the mid-2000, as China's demand for oilseeds has grown, Paul Thomas, a North Dakota State farmer in the United States, has grown more and more soybeans in his field.
The shift peaked this year, when he planted 1,600 acres of soybeans in 5,000 acres, the size he had not seen before.
But Thomas and many farmers like him plan to turn to the staple crops of former American agricultural areas in 2019: Corn and wheat.
American farmers have grown more soybeans this year than corn, for the first time since 35.
The shift to other food crops is planned because American farmers face a dilemma in selling soybeans in the context of US President Trump's trade war against China.
China typically buys about 60% of U.S. exports of soybeans, but because of a trade war, almost 0 of U.S. soybeans have been bought in recent months, causing soybean prices to fall to a decade-low.
Thomas plans to grow more wheat next year, hoping to make more by reducing his dependence on crops that depend on Chinese demand.
Mr Thomas said soybean prices were "a painful blow to us."
Without Chinese buying, he says, the spot price for soybeans near its farm is $7.10 trillion per bushel, and the price required to cover costs is $8.50 trillion.
American farmers have a record high soybean cultivation this year, and the harvest is expected to hit a record high.
At a time when it was vulnerable to shocks, they were hit by a trade war.
In response to Trump's imposition of tariffs on imported Chinese goods, China imposed import duties on imports of U.S. soybeans in July.
The USDA will release its first estimate of the area under cultivation next year, which is expected to include consideration of the impact of tariffs.
The estimate is expected to confirm expectations that private institutions will reduce the sown area of soybeans.
According to a report seen by Reuters, Informa Economics predicted on October 19 that corn cultivation would increase by 4% to 92.7 million acres (37.5 million hectares) in 2019 and that soybean cultivation would be reduced by 7% to 83 million acres.
Informa also expects the area under wheat cultivation in the United States to increase by 4 per cent.
The area of soybeans grown before retaliatory tariffs rose to 89.6 million acres this year, about 15 million acres higher than they were 10 ago.
Corn cultivation has increased by less than 5 million acres to 89.1 million acres since 2008, and this year wheat has grown at 47.8 million acres, nearly the lowest level in 100 years.
Aron Carlson, president of the Illinois State Corn Growing Association, has a total planting area of 3,600 acres, nearly half of which he uses to grow soybeans this year, but plans to cut back in the future.
He claims he may have increased corn cultivation by up to 20 per cent on his farm north of Illinois State; The state is the largest soybean growing state in the United States.
Soybeans yield less than corn per acre, but also require less fertilizer, making soybeans generally less expensive to grow.
If farmers move to final corn, it could raise costs, but it will benefit some businesses, including Andersons Inc. fertilizer sellers.
Andersons CEO Pat Bowe told Reuters he expected a transfer of corn would be good for fertilizer use.
Bayer is also expected to benefit from the conversion of corn to farmers.

Xinhua International: Defending Multilateralism and the unity of Chinese know-how.
At a moment when unilateralism is surging against the current, international rules and multilateral order have been hit.
To some extent, the confrontation between unilateralism and multilateralism has entered a critical period.
As a responsible power, China, with the concept of the great trend and the road, and solid and vigorous action, together with the international community to safeguard multilateralism and promote multilateralism to continue to move forward.
Facing the new situation and new challenges, China has made a loud voice on the development direction and path of multilateralism.
As State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in his speech to the general debate of the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, multilateralism in the new era should adhere to the goal of win-win cooperation, based on the rules and order, with fairness and justice as the Tenet and effective action as the guide.
At the same time, China calls for the construction of a global development cooperation pattern complemented by the United Nations as the core, North-South cooperation as the main channel, and South cooperation
China's thinking and voice reflect the mainstream voice of the international community.
As Espinosa, president of the 73rd session of the General Assembly, said, under the current circumstances, "the United Nations needs, more than ever, to promote multilateralism and uphold a rules-based international system".
Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said the international community should continue to firmly uphold the multilateral trading system, adhere to international trade rules and resolve differences through consultation.
In recent years, with the adjustment of the contrast of global economic and political forces, some emerging markets and groups of developing countries have risen to play a greater role in the major international multilateral mechanisms, providing a new impetus for the development of multilateralism, which is encountering headwinds.
Standing in this dimension, China's initiative to build a large family rather than a patchwork of small circles, adhere to the idea of co-construction rather than winner-take-all and other multilateralism, in line with the trend of the times, is the inevitable choice to deal with global challenges and solve the world's problems, representing the common aspirations of most countries in the world.
There are advanced ideas, more solid action.
The "Belt and Road" initiative put forward by China has become the largest platform for international cooperation.
China has initiated international and regional cooperation initiatives such as the construction of the Belt and Road, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the "16+1 cooperation" to promote international regional cooperation, improve the existing international system and order, bring innovative vitality to the cooperation of multilateralism, and contribute to the development of a more just and rational direction for the international order.
As a defender of the international order and a practitioner of multilateralism, China's actions have become increasingly powerful in the multilateral arena of the United Nations.
Good offices in international hotspots, addressing climate change, participating in peacekeeping operations, contributing significantly to poverty reduction and contributing to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable development in other countries.
As UN Secretary General Guterres has said, China has become an important pillar of multilateralism.
When the "trust deficit" facing the world intensifies, when the trend of populism and polarization rises, it is the most urgent moment for the world to demand multilateral cooperation.
At such a historical juncture, the international community needs to join hands, translate consensus into action, resolutely defend multilateralism and jointly promote the construction of a community of human destiny.

On the evening of September 20 this year, on the K158 train, Joe, who was studying junior in Zhengzhou, went to Hebi in a car.
A master on the train bought a ticket without a seat, but took up her seat: "Shoot it."
A two-hour drive, the conductor advised him that an hour was still invalid.
In the end, a male passenger in the same carriage could not see the master pull up.
From the public opinion, although most of the final results are bullies by the public condemnation, by the Public Security Department administrative punishment, and even included in the integrity blacklist, but the general government still feel not "manages": Why not let the bully on the spot to be punished?
Why can't it be stopped on the spot for its immoral or even illegal behavior, but to punish it afterwards?
And for the "master bully" unreasonable behavior, how is only a male passenger "road see uneven" and pull it up?
The main reason for this is that only long-haul trains are equipped with crew, short-haul trains generally do not; even if there is crew, crew is more concerned about the possible rogue reaction of the bully without taking coercive removal measures.
The repeated bullying events have made people realize that bullies must be forcibly removed or even punished on the spot in order to act as a deterrent.
This requires that our train crew to dare to take strong measures in a timely manner, no crew trains should be configured as soon as possible crew, in order to preserve the timely suppression and fight against illegal acts.

On the other hand, we should step up enforcement efforts, open up supervision of "capillaries", and never allow fake and shoddy breeding and spread in rural areas.
Severe punishment of pit farmers is the protection of farmers, no matter how hidden hidden by counterfeiters, should not be a reason for the breeding of fake goods, the relevant departments should be clear responsibility, the grass-roots supervision of the sinking, which link problems, we must be held accountable, so that counterfeiting, selling dummies have nowhere to hide.
Strict market access, the implementation of strict qualification examination of production operators, the housing market circulation, so that products to the right, the way to clear, from the source, root to find ways to allow legitimate distributors to operate with peace of mind, so that farmers can buy at ease.
Activate rural consumption, to guide the demand for healthy consumption.
With the upgrading of consumption, many farmers not only pursue to eat full, eat well, but also pursue cultural, health and other high-quality life, can not be the rural market and "low quality" "cheap" painting equal sign.
This needs to promote the extension of e-commerce to the vast number of rural areas, smooth urban and rural two-way linkage sales channels, promote the combination of offline industrial development platform and online e-commerce trading platform, support the new mode of consumption of new business to expand into the rural market; promote the qualified township to Trade logistics and leisure agriculture, rural tourism, product processing ; Improve the rural modern circulation network system, optimize the integration of stock facilities resources, and effectively reduce the cost of rural circulation.
