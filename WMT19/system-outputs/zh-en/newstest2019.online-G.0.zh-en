According to the British "Jane's Defense Weekly" website reported on September 24, the United States announced the new defense strategy at the beginning of the China-Russia as a strategic competitor.
Since then, the US Navy has restored the Second Fleet in order to more directly counter Russian activity.
The move, it said, raised questions and concerns among allies and analysts that the US Navy might be moving away from the“Asia-Pacific rebalancing”strategy that marks the Obama administration.
But Admiral Moran said the United States Navy remains focused on the western Pacific.
On January 24, 2018, at a roundtable discussion entitled“meeting the challenges of the high seas”hosted by the National Bureau of Asian Studies in Washington, he said: "for us, no major changes have taken place . ”
“ The focus is still on rebalancing, center of gravity shifting, or whatever you want to describe it, " says Moran. ”
But he acknowledged that the United States has close ties with Europe.
“ We will continue to focus on the growth of the West Coast and balance what we can do, " he said . ”
While Moran points out that the overall policy regarding Russia falls within the purview of the US Defense Secretary, he cautions “ " Russians may face demographic and economic challenges, but history has shown that they will be very tough if we conflict with them. ”
Admiral Moran said that as part of the United States 'comeback against Russia, China, and other contenders, the US Navy is dynamically deploying troops into a " new combat mode " that will help to get the adversary unprepared for where the US Airways mother battle group or other assets will be deployed at any given time and place.
He said: "We Navy and Marines support it-the concept of operational unpredictability, do not appear again and again in the same place, almost like clockwork-this is our approach . ”
The first attempt at such a new approach was the“Harry・Truman”carrier combat group, whose early deployment included a working visit to the port and patrolling in areas that were usually only routed through, according to the report.
Mr. Moran said that the United States Navy was currently working to ensure that allies knew that the ships would still patrol traditional areas, and was also addressing logistical and family liaison issues for the new deployment process.
General Michael・Noonan, commander of the Royal Australian Navy, also spoke at the event, saying that Australian troops could work seamlessly with American aircraft carrier battle groups.
This will continue, he said, as the Australian Royal Navy plans to purchase another 9 frigates equipped with the Aegis combat system.

Interview with Chief Executive Officer, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Australia: significant results of scientific and technological cooperation between Australia and China
"China's science and technology has developed rapidly over the past few decades, and the two countries can achieve fruitful results in the field of science. ”
Australian Federal Science and Industry Research Organization CEO Larry Marshall in Beijing recently in an interview with China News Agency, said, from climate change to the“eye”project cooperation, Australia in the field of Science and technology cooperation to show vitality.
As the largest state-level scientific research institution in the Commonwealth of Australia, CSIRO has achieved many world-renowned innovative research results in marine, energy, biology, materials, astronomy and other fields.
CSIRO and the Chinese Academy of Sciences and other research institutions have maintained a close relationship.
“This is a lasting friendship that embraces a tradition of trust in partners and long-term cooperation . "Said Marshall.
In May, China's 500 ― meter ― caliber Spherical Radio Telescope - “China's Day eye ” installed the International First Station 19-beam L-band receiver.
This is currently the most advanced 19 beam feed receiver, jointly developed by the Chinese and Australian scientists.
Marshall said, the successful development of the receiver is based on the accumulation of CSIRO technology for many years, after the launch, FAST Sky patrol speed will increase 5 to 6 times, at the same time, will also expand more scientific observation target.
“This is a strength that CSIRO has contributed to FAST . ”
In addition to the above-mentioned cooperation, CSIRO also in the construction of Square Kilometer Array radio telescope, research and development of new fuel technology, energy saving and emission reduction and other aspects of China's scientific research institutions have a close cooperation.
"Past scientific research is often focused on the problem after a hundred years, and now need more scientific research to solve the problem in front of." ”
Marshall believes that Australia and China are complementary in the field of scientific development, while the two countries are facing a series of challenges in development.
For example, extreme weather is occurring frequently around the world, drought and floods have led to food cuts and food shortages have seriously affected human development.
At the same time, population explosion, aging, chronic disease and other issues are also facing serious challenges.
"The cooperation between Australia and China in recent years has focused on solving these current problems. ”
Marshall said that CSIRO and Qingdao National Laboratory of Marine Science and technology to build the International Marine Research Center in the Southern Hemisphere, whose work focuses on the observation of the El Niño phenomenon and the La Niña phenomenon, the relationship between the two and the extreme weather, and the establishment of extreme weather warning facilities; CSIRO and the Chinese Academy of Sciences to develop new varieties of grain to overcome extreme weather, can also alleviate the food shortage caused by extreme weather.
"The current environment, scientific and technological innovation is difficult to complete alone, requires a high cost, the problem to be solved is also very much, so cooperation is particularly important in today." ”
Marshall said that the closer the cooperation, the more likely it is to achieve breakthrough progress, which is the Australian and Chinese sides in the“Belt and Road”under the framework of the significance of strengthening cooperation.
"To strengthen bilateral cooperation, for us it is primarily cooperation in science and technology. ”
Marshall, for example, CSIRO developed a new gold purification method does not use cyanide, because the traditional cyanide gold purification method is very harmful to the environment, many countries are hoping to find a small environmental pollution gold purification method.
“We are very willing to introduce this technology to China, which is one of the results we have achieved in the Belt and Road cooperation." ”

North Korea's Foreign Minister, Lee Yong-Ho, told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued imposition of sanctions is deepening North Korea's distrust of the United States, and that North Korea cannot unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons in a situation like this.
In the United Nations General Assembly, Mr. Lee said North Korea has taken a“very friendly approach " over the past year, including stopping missiles and nuclear tests, dismantling nuclear test sites, and committing to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we don't see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"There is no confidence in our national security if there is no confidence in the United States, and it is impossible for us to give up weapons unilaterally in such a situation . ”
While Yong-Ho is repeating North Korea's complaints about America's opposition to“phased”denuclearization, his speech is of great significance because there is no complete rejection of unilateral denuclearization, as North Korea did before.
Lee Yong-Ho mentioned the joint statement of Kim Jong-Un and Trump on June 12, when Kim Jong-Un agreed to work towards“denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, " and Trump pledged to protect North Korea's security.
North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says it must first renounce nuclear weapons.
The United States has also refused to loosen its demand for international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on' de-nucleation first ’ and increases the pressure on sanctions to achieve its objectives in a high-pressure manner, and even refuses to issue a 'declaration of the end of the war', " said Li Yong-Hao.
"The idea that sanctions will bring us to our knees is that people who don't understand us are daydreaming.
But the problem is that such continuing sanctions are deepening our distrust . ”
Lee Yong-Ho did not mention the second Tekin plan that the president of the United States had mentioned earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, he highlighted three meetings over the past five months between Kim Jong-Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in, and said: "if the other side of denuclearization is South Korea, not North Korea, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will not become so deadlocked . ”

The adjusted total tariff level is slightly higher than that of the EU, lower than that of most developing countries, at a moderate low level, which is essentially matched by China's developing country status and stage of development.
The person in charge introduced that the general level of tariffs as one of the important indicators of the degree of openness in the field of trade in Chinese goods, should be compatible with the stage of economic development of China and reflect the characteristics of the Times.
China's trade in goods is the largest in the world, and it already has the economic foundation to further expand the opening up, but the quality and benefits of trade development are still different from those of the advanced economies. therefore, the total level of tariffs should be reduced appropriately.
Tariff is the means of compliance protection, tariff level should be compatible with industrial competitiveness, to encourage healthy competition, excessive protection is not conducive to industrial development and improve the quality.

Serbia has declared a state of maximum readiness the president of Serbia and Russia will meet tomorrow to discuss the situation in Kosovo
The president of Serbia has ordered the Armed Forces of Serbia to enter maximum readiness in view of the occupation by the Kosovo Special Forces of the access road to the water storage lake at the Gazi Voda hydroelectric station, which is controlled by the Belgrade side in northern Kosovo, according to the news agency of the Office of the president of Serbia.
On 29 September, the Serbian Minister of Defence declared that the Serbian Army was in full combat readiness.
Wulin stressed that as long as the order issued by wucic remains valid, Serbia will continue to monitor the current situation in Kosovo, regardless of the direction of development, the army will respond.
According to Russia's TASS, on September 29, Vucic said in an interview that he had informed the parties and the US-Russia and Europe about the current situation, and will go to Moscow on October 2 to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to seek the support of Vladimir Putin on the Kosovo issue.
When asked whether Serbia needs Russian military support like Syria, Vucic gives a negative answer: "I do not want a major military conflict on our territory . ”
Vucic also said that the entry of the army into full combat readiness was only intended to form a deterrent to the occurrence of the conflict, but it was also a clear warning: there would be absolutely no tolerance for any violence in Kosovo.
The increase in the combat readiness of the army was linked to two major initiatives in Kosovo.
According to the Serbian side, in recent days, Albanians have been making extensive arrests in the northern part of Kosovo for generations of Serbs living there, and these arrested Serbs have not violated any laws.
Vucic said that since 26 March, when the head of the Office of the government of Serbia in Kosovo and Metohija, Mr. Mako・Juric, was beaten and detained by the Kosovo Albanian army, there have been escalating incidents in the area of ethnic Albanian and indiscriminate arrests and killings of Serbs.
In addition, over 100 people, including the Ministry of internal affairs of the Republic of Kosovo (MOF) ROSU, armed police and snipers, who have declared their own, have taken positions near the water storage lake at the Gazi Voda hydroelectric power station, entered the ecological and sports centre near the northern embankment of the Kosovo region and blocked all roads in the vicinity, which were controlled by the Serbian side.
Vucic noted that this military adventure in Kosovo was carried out at the instigation of Western countries, that the Kosovo army did not inform the Serbian side in advance, in violation of Chapter IX, paragraph 1, of the Brussels accords, and of the military-technical agreement between the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 and Secco.
Mr. Vucic has called out to the Secretary-General, Mr. Stoltenberg, to criticize the hypocrisy of the West over Kosovo.
The root causes of the current conflict remain centuries-old rivalries between the Seah and Kosovo communities.
The Serbs and the Albanians each have their own version of Kosovo's attribution.
Serbia saw Kosovo as the birthplace and cultural cradle of the nation, as Serbia built its strongest state in the 12th century, and the Albanians moved in large numbers only after the invasion of the Ottoman Empire and the defeat of the Serbs to the North.
The ethnic Albanians insist that the Illyrians of the primitive tribes who inhabited Kosovo in the 4th-5th centuries BC were the ancestors of the Albanians, so that Kosovo was the territory of the Albanians since ancient times.
The subjectivity of political partitioning has led to violent clashes of different nationalities, religions and cultures, and to violent confrontations between Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo.
In 1912, the Kosovo Albanians first declared the independence of Albania.
After the first World War, a large number of ethnic Albanians living in the Balkans moved to Turkey, the proportion of the relative increase in the proportion of Serbs, in the view of the Serbs”just to take back their own land "approach, but the Albanians as”big Serb doctrine" plunder, the two ethnic conflicts intensified.
Kosovo became a “powder keg ” in the Balkans.
In 1999, an armed conflict between the Albanian separatists of the Kosovo Liberation Army and the Serbian Army and police led to the bombing of the Yugoslav Union of Serbia and Montenegro by the NATO army and the outbreak of the war in Kosovo.
On 17 February 2008, Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia.
Since then, despite the news that Serbia will normalize relations with Kosovo and sign a global and legally binding agreement, but due to historical national grievances and geopolitical constraints, subject to the United States and Europe and the Russian Federation and other multilateral agreements can not be signed.
Just a month ago, for the first time, Vucic made it clear that he was advocating the isolation of Kosovo Serbs from the Albanians, and that the two communities were once again open to the public.

China's State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, speaking on Friday at the US Foreign Relations Commission, said that at the current time, the relationship between the United States and China has once again reached a crossroads, and if the two sides can positively and inclusively look at each other, expand and deepen the positive cooperation, properly control the differences and contradictions,
"Sino-US relations are our common asset and need our care. ”
He expressed his hope that the two countries will take practical actions to safeguard the healthy and stable development of Sino-American relations and jointly promote Sino-American relations to move forward in the right direction.
Wang Yi also once again stressed that China will come out of a different path of development from the traditional powers.
This path of Chinese character determines that China will not and will not be able to repeat the same fate as China, and that China will neither become the United States nor challenge the United States, nor will it replace the United States.
In a speech entitled "opportunities or challenges, partners or rivals," Wang Yi said, the deep crux of the problem is that some American friends believe that China will also be the country will be strong, and even challenge and replace the United States leadership in the world.
"This is clearly a major strategic miscalculation. ”
But this suspicion of self-imagination is spreading, he says, and it amplifies existing contradictions, giving rise to new doubts, and making it harder and more resistant to resolving specific issues between China and the United States.
Wang Yi pointed out that China is on a path of peaceful development.
The Chinese have never had the gene to expand.
I believe that countries can live in harmony, exchange and mutual understanding.
In the past, now and in the future, China will neither copy the foreign model nor ask other countries to copy the Chinese practice.
Earlier, when Wang Yi met with former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in New York, he said that cooperation between China and the United States would be a win-win, and confrontation would be a double loser.
China has always been committed to developing long-term healthy and stable relations between China and the United States,so as to achieve win-win results without conflict or confrontation, mutual respect and cooperation.

The two young lions born on August 25, a female and a male, are quite healthy and normal, says ganswelt, director of the Institute of mammals at the University of Pretoria.
His team after 18 months of intensive testing, finally reached the breakthrough.
"We collected sperm from a healthy lion. ”
Next, the researchers and other female hormones in the body to achieve the appropriate level, artificial insemination for it.
Ganswelt said: "Fortunately, the result was successful . ”
The researchers“tried several times, but, surprisingly, they did not spend much effort, ” he said.
He said the breakthroughs were repeatable and scientists wanted to use the technology to save the endangered big cats.
The International Union for conservation of Nature (IUCN) notes that the lion has been extinct in 26 African countries and that the total number of surviving wild lions has dropped by 43% in the last 20 years, leaving only about 20,000.
African lions are classified as vulnerable animals by this group.
“ If we don't do something for this animal, they will face extinction. ”
The new technology, he said, does not require the lion to be bred, but rather by injecting sperm into a fertile lioness, as is the case in North America and Europe for keeping elephants in captivity.
South Korea's biggest export decline in September was more than two years, but analysts attributed the decline to fewer days of work and said global demand for South Korean goods remained strong despite rising trade tensions between China and the United States.
Indeed, South Korea's average daily exports increased last month.
In addition, earlier published initial data showed double-digit growth in exports in the first weeks of September before the long holidays.
South Korea's September export year-on-year decline is the largest since July 2016, the decline is greater than the Reuters survey 11 analysts estimated decline of 5. 7 % .
The initial value announced on Monday showed exports of $ 506 billion in September, down from $ 51 billion in August.
South Korea's export growth in September 7. 8%, the 23rd consecutive month of expansion.
South Korea's exports to the U.S. declined 11. 8%, due to the decline in sales of petroleum products.
Overseas sales of Korean memory chips and petroleum products increased by 28. 3%and 13. 5%, although the market worried about the so-called chip "super cycle" may have peaked.
"However, the impact of the trade conflict will be difficult to avoid, because South Korea's exports to a large extent rely on the United States and China market." ”
Import decline 2. 1% to 408 billion dollars, is not as good as the estimated growth of the Reuters survey 3. 1 % .
The initial trade surplus was $ 9.7 billion in September, up from $ 6.9 billion in August.
Thanks to the United States and the European Union, global manufacturing will remain buoyant, the ministry said, which is a favorable factor for South Korea's exports.
“ The increase in export prices caused by higher oil prices will also be good for exports in the second half of this year, " the statement said. ”
"But the continuation of the trade conflict between the United States and China, plus the United States after the rate increase market volatility, are facing negative pressure on exports." ”
Exports averaged $ 2.6 billion per working day in September, compared to $ 2.1 billion in August.
South Korea this year the Mid-Autumn Festival falls on September 24-26, so September is only 19. 5 working days, four days less than the same period last year.
South Korea 1-September export growth compared with the same period last year 4. 7 % .
According to the Nikkei/Markit PMI, South Korea's manufacturing activity picked up in September, but it was supported by domestic orders as orders from China and Japan slid, which threatens to rein in the outlook for exports.
North Korean media criticized the United States for not relaxing sanctions against the DPRK
Citing a commentary in the September 30 issue of the North Korean Labor News, criticizing the United States for seeking dialogue with the DPRK without loosing sanctions against the DPRK, said it was "contradictory".
The article said that the United States Secretary of State Pompeo on the 14th called "to achieve the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, the key is to fulfill the sanctions against the DPRK", stressed that the United States continue to implement the United Nations sanctions resolution unchanged.
In the Sino-US joint statement, the two sides pledged to establish a new DPRK-US relationship commensurate with the desire of the DPRK and the US to expect peace and prosperity.
It is paradoxical that the United States, with its increased sanctions and its demand for dialogue, should be encouraged.
The article says that if we want to establish a new DPRK-US relationship, build a permanently consolidated peace system on the Korean Peninsula, and realize the complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, we should put the building of trust in the first place, starting from what we can do, one by one.
The article also said that the United States should understand that sanctions to suppress the DPRK will not work.
The article says that even the”Severodvinsk“, before the”Kazan", has impressed the American troops.
“ We will meet strong potential adversaries, " the National Interest magazine quoted the U.S. Navy as saying.Just look at the’Severodvinsk ' submarine is enough. ”
The current US military commander in chief of the European Navy Fogo also praised the”North devinsk " submarine.
“ The submarine is impressive, " he said.Looking at the development of the Russian navy, how to use resources, it will be known that its main efforts in research and development are, first and foremost, to strengthen the submarine fleet. ”
But "National Interest" magazine still believes that the United States in this area to maintain the advantages of Russia.
Fogo said: "I believe that the Western countries still have asymmetric advantages. ”
Earlier it was reported that the Russian Navy will install the“Kazan”submarine in 2019.
”Kazan“,”Novosibirsk“,”Krasnoyarsk“,”Arkhangelsk "multi-purpose submarines are”ash tree-M" modified, displacement of 13800 tons, dive depth of 520 meters, staffing 64 people, underwater speed 31 knots, will carry mines, torpedoes and“caliber”and“onyx”cruise missiles.

Ignore the American threat!
The EU may conclude a crude oil purchase agreement with Iran
The United States government has announced that it will restart a new round of sanctions against Iran in November, and even urged other countries to reduce imports of Iranian oil.
But America's allies do not seem to listen.
Tehran is nearing an agreement with the European Union on the sale of crude oil, despite threats by the United States to sanction any country doing business with Iran, Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif revealed on the 29th, the New York Times reported.
The core purpose of the agreement is to try to create a new payment mechanism, that is, barter or local currency denominated way, to replace the dollar transaction.
The aim of the method is to hopefully bypass the US and prevent the US from hampering financial transfers.
At the same time, while the European Union is committed to making the deal happen, some French and British officials are concerned that, if the deal is implemented, it would be the most open confrontation between the European Union and the United States, which opposes the withdrawal of the US from the Iran nuclear deal.
In an hour's interview, Mr. Zarif sounded more optimistic than in recent months, the media said.
Because the deal has the ability to”strip " America's traditional allies and effectively break down the US Party's attempts to cut Iran's revenues.
” This will ensure that we sell oil and gain, " Zarif said, arguing that countries have the legal right to trade with Iran, according to the agreement reached in 2015.
“ No sovereign state or organization can accept other people to decide who they can trade with, " said the EU's foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini. ”
But she also predicted that, before the next steps in Washington's sanctions were launched in November, American leaders could adopt a range of financial measures aimed at targeting banks, businessmen and countries that have business ties with Tehran.
In May, the US government unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal on the grounds that the deal was flawed, saying it could not permanently ban Iran from producing nuclear fuel.
The US then threatened to ban companies that bought Iranian oil and other commodities from doing business in the United States.
This threat led to the withdrawal of some companies from Tehran and the collapse of the Iranian currency.
Airbus and French oil giant Total and other companies have canceled billions of dollars in investment in Iraq.
British and French officials have said that the US government may“prevail".
Indeed, according to a recent report by Turkish media, US sanctions do not seem to have a significant impact on Iran's oil exports.
Iranian oil minister zankane has revealed that no country other than South Korea has stopped buying Iranian oil.
Both Zarif and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani argue that the American side's actions are aimed at”tempting " Iran to violate the agreement.
Zarif was also dismissive of a string of verbal attacks on the US, and when asked whether the US would overthrow the current Iranian government under ever-increasing fiscal pressure, Zarif even laughed, “ it is a regime change tactic, and that is the real purpose of the US. ”

Reuters in Nagoya November 5 - BOJ President Haruhiko Kuroda said Monday that the central bank was aware that the long-term implementation of ultra-loose monetary policy could squeeze profit margins of financial institutions and could destabilize the country's banking system.
But he said the BOJ needed to maintain its large-scale stimulus plan, while paying close attention to the advantages and disadvantages of its policies, given the low inflation and uncertainty in overseas economies.
"The Bank of Japan fully acknowledges that the strength of financial institutions will be increasingly affected by continued monetary easing, ” Mr. Kuroda said in a speech to business leaders in Nagoya.
He said the banking system could be volatile in the event of a serious negative impact if financial institutions were to take risks more aggressively to compensate for years of narrowing margins caused by low interest rates.
"Although these risks are not large at the moment, the central bank will closely monitor the situation and encourage financial institutions to take the necessary measures," he said.
The BOJ policy committee discussed rising costs of long-term easing, according to the minutes of the BOJ meeting published earlier on Monday.
The minutes showed that one member said that if the economy continued to expand, “ the Bank of Japan will have more flexibility in terms of policy." ”
The minutes showed that another committee said that, given its limitations during the policy period, the committee should discuss how long the Bank of Japan could sustain the stimulus.
Mr. Kuroda said the Bank of Japan would assess the financial risks associated with easing, while taking into account the uncertainty surrounding Japan's economic outlook, which could affect global demand as a result of Sino-American trade frictions and growing protectionism.
"The impact of such issues on the Japanese economy is temporarily limited," Mr. Kuroda said.
"But how the problem continues, the impact on the Japanese economy may become larger , ” he added.
"There is a need for sustained strong monetary easing, while taking into account both positive and negative effects in a balanced manner, ” Mr. Kuroda said.
While the drawbacks of aggressive stimulus programs, such as long-term low interest rates, erode the gains of financial institutions, the downturn in inflation has forced the Bank of Japan to maintain the program.
The Bank of Japan maintained monetary policy last month;Mr. Kuroda ruled out a recent rate hike in the face of the risks posed by the global trade war dispute.
June 1, 2018, the corporate identity of the American Cardiff, Tesla electric car.
Under a settlement agreement,Tesla Motors and its chief executive, Musk, have agreed to each pay a $ 20 million fine to financial regulators, and Musk will resign as chairman of the company, but remain CEO.
The settlement will end Tesla's two-month turmoil.
Investors will be relieved by the Securities and Exchange Commission's alleged settlement on Saturday.
Investors feared that the protracted legal battle would only further cripple the electric car company, which is still losing money.
The SEC sued Musk fraud on Thursday, calling its August 7 tweet misleading investors.
The tweet says he is considering privatizing Tesla for $ 420 per share and has secured financing.
The SEC said the tweets were actually unfounded, and that the market turmoil it triggered was damaging to investors.
Investors and corporate governance experts said the deal could strengthen Tesla, which has been hit hard by recent behavior in Musk.
Steven Heim, head of asset management at Boston Common, said the settlement agreement should have given Musk more oversight, while failing to take“destructive”measures to drive him out of Tesla.
The asset management company holds the stock of Panasonic, a manufacturer of batteries from Tesla.
Under the proposed agreement, Tesla must appoint an independent chairman, two independent directors and a board of directors to develop control over Musk's external communications.
"The matter is resolved quickly on agreed terms in the best interests of our markets and our investors, including Tesla shareholders," SEC Chairman Clayton said in a statement.
The charges on Thursday led to the evaporation of about $ 7 billion in Tesla's market capitalization, which was $ 452 billion on Friday, down from $ 475m.
In the settlement, the SEC retracted the claim that Maske had ousted the head of the company.
Many investors said the penalty would be disastrous.
” I think this is the best possible outcome for all those involved, "said Tigress Financial Partners' Ivan Feinseth, who gave Tesla a“neutral”rating to Feinseth, adding that the SEC's penalties were“lighter punishment ” for Musk.
"He is still important to Tesla as CEO. ”
Neither Musk nor Tesla acknowledged or denied the SEC's allegations in the settlement agreement, and did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Settlement agreements still need to be approved by the court.

South Korean President Moon Jae-in relayed the DPRK's”irreversible " decision to abandon its nuclear weapons program and said that US President Trump and North Korea's top leader, Kim Jong-Un, could meet before the end of the year.
The U.S. State Department then said Secretary of State Pompeo would visit North Korea in October to push ahead with the promise of a meeting between us and North Korean leaders in Singapore.
From the beginning of this year to the present day, the two Koreas have broken the ice to open the way to dialogue. the leaders of the two Koreas and the United States have held meetings.
First of all, "the essence of the peninsula problem is the security problem" has not changed, to achieve peace on the peninsula, the key is to properly and balanced to solve the legitimate security concerns of the parties, rather than blindly to each other pressure, blindly emphasize our own demands.
Secondly, in the realization of the denuclearization of the peninsula in the dialogue, the parties concerned on the realization of the denuclearization of the peninsula steps and ways of disagreement, due to the long-term lack of political trust between the DPRK and the United States,”who first who after " game thinking is still strong.
At the open meeting of the Security Council on the Korean Peninsula held at the United Nations headquarters in New York, different voices from all sides around the issue of sanctions against the DPRK once again highlighted the two points on the peninsula "has not changed".

Russia's Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, emphasized the principle of "to respond to action by action," noting that ” the weakening of sanctions should be in line with North Korea's steps on the road to nuclear disarmament."
There is no doubt that the parties concerned should continue to implement the resolutions of the council in a comprehensive, complete and accurate manner, but pressure is not an end. the implementation of the sanctions and the promotion of a political settlement are the requirements of the council's resolutions.
As China's State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, Given the current positive developments in relations between the two Koreas and the United States, China believes that it is necessary for the Security Council to consider activating the reversible provisions in a timely manner so as to encourage the DPRK and all the parties concerned to take greater steps towards denuclearization.
In retrospect, the denuclearization of the peninsula and every progress in the peace process required sufficient political courage on all sides.
At present, in the face of the growing expectations of the international community to promote the political settlement of the peninsula, all parties concerned should especially show political vigour, make political decisions, implement commitments, resolve difficult problems, continue to take the opposite step forward, and parallel progress in the process of denuclearization of the peninsula and the establishment of peace mechanisms on the peninsula, and jointly create a permanent peace on the peninsula.

Reuters Tokyo, October 1 - according to a quarterly survey released Monday by the Bank of Japan, the confidence of large Japanese manufacturers in the quarter in September hit its lowest level in more than a year, as companies felt pressure from rising raw material costs and a series of natural disasters affecting production.
The survey barely shows that escalating global trade frictions hit the confidence of large manufacturers.
But the risk of a full-scale trade war hit the business prospects of the business and could threaten business capital expenditures.
Active capital spending is a bright spot in the Japanese economy.
The survey raised questions about the Bank of Japan's view that a robust economic expansion would help push the inflation rate to the 2% target, although there are signs that companies are gradually shifting costs to customers.
"Amid fears of a global trade war, confidence among manufacturers has stagnated due to slower exports and weak factory production, ” said Wu Zhi Nan, Chief Research Fellow at the Institute of Agriculture and Forestry Research.
"Confidence is still high.And since corporate profits are improving and prices are rising, I don't think confidence will continue to decline. ”
According to the survey, the large-scale manufacturing industry sentiment index fell from positive 21 to positive 19 three months ago in September, which worsened the third consecutive quarter.
The median market estimate is positive 22.
The large non-manufacturing sentiment index fell to positive 22 from positive 24 in the June survey in September, the first deterioration for the eight quarters.
The Reuters survey is positive 22.
The survey shows that in December large-scale manufacturing and non-manufacturing sentiment index remained stable.
Investors on the short-term business climate index decline does not care, the Nikkei index.The N225 rose to a 27-year high on Monday as the yen continued to depreciate to help improve the export earnings outlook for Japanese companies.
Capital expenditure is sound.
Despite a decline in business confidence, the latest short-term outlook highlights a robust business capex program that benefits from renewing production capacity and increasing investment in robotics and automation to address the labor shortage caused by an aging population.
The central bank survey shows that large enterprises plan to increase capital expenditure in the current fiscal year ending March 2019 13. 4 % .
The previous short-term survey was 13. 6 % .
South Wu Zhi said that the capital expenditure of all enterprises plan to grow 8. 5%, close to the pace of Japan's bubble economy era.
"There is still room for further growth in capital spending, given small-scale business inflated earnings estimates from now on, but this is largely dependent on the impact of the trade war on business confidence," he said . ”
The increase in the ability of companies to pass on their costs and the positive 7-year price index for large-scale enterprises is an encouraging sign, reflecting the progress made in Japan's efforts to combat deflation.
The index, which measures the employment situation of large enterprises, hit negative 23, the most tight level since 1992, highlighting the tightening of the job market.
Japan's economy rebounded in the second quarter from a contraction in January-March, benefiting from strong corporate spending.
But the escalating trade frictions in the summer and the supply-chain disrupted by natural disasters have left Japan's export-dependent economic prospects bleak.

But Mr Chan said that the high capacity of anti-seismic capability does not mean that property owners will not be harmed by the economic downturn, because property valuations will fall, and those who buy property during peak periods will bear the brunt.
While the HKMA has tightened its lending to mortgage lenders, home buyers can also obtain a high percentage of mortgage loans through mortgage insurance or mortgage loans provided by developers.
Mr Chan said that at present, together with the mortgage loans provided to developers, the loan-to-value ratio of borrowers could reach 85-90%. if property prices fell by 10%, there would be negative assets (i.e. the market value of the property fell below the level of the total outstanding mortgage loans).
However, Mr Nguyen guoheng, vice-president of the HKMA, said that the authorities estimated that the total amount of high-yield mortgages provided by developers accounted for only 2-2. 5% of the total amount of bank mortgages, which is still low.
During the peak period of negative assets in 2003, the number of negative assets in Hong Kong exceeded 100,000, accounting for 22% of the supply of property.
As of the third quarter of this year, Hong Kong has recorded zero negative assets for seven consecutive quarters.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic disease that affects many organs throughout the body and has been previously considered an "incurable disease".
Because of its pathogenesis is unknown, difficult diagnosis and treatment, the lack of effective treatment and shall not cure.
Recently, Liu Wanli, a researcher at the school of life science, Tsinghua University, and Li Jian, director of the Center for Rheumatology and immunology, Peking University people's hospital, have found that human immunoglobulin has increased systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) susceptibility to molecular variation, and this variation is involved in the regulation of immune B cells.

A lawyer carrying an ax to court?
The news at first glance really irritating, also blasted the pot in the legal circle.
Fujian Quanzhou City, the Chinese law then involved in the lawyer fine 500 yuan, and written recommendations for Quanzhou Lawyers Association for investigation and settlement.
According to the Beijing News report, a few days ago, Quanzhou City Law Society issued an official notification that the two lawyers ' behavior does not involve violations of the law, according to the law will not be punished.
From the multi-party reports, Quanzhou City Law Society's treatment is not short-circuiting or engage in confrontation, but has been recognized by the Quanzhou Institute.
One of the events that could have sparked tension within the legal community was finally resolved.
The reversal of the matter stems from a more complete restoration of the truth:the ax carried by the lawyer and the murder weapon of the defendant are of the same type and the same model, but they are not edged, and they are only used for supporting evidence in the evidence-based Link, and there is no subjective intention of intimidating or“endangering the security of the court”.
There are four very important details that need attention: firstly, the Local Court held two previous sessions, only showed a photo of the axe, and from the point of view of the defense, it is necessary to show the original axe; secondly, the axe was purchased only one hour before the trial, not because the lawyer did not want to seek the consent of the judge, but he could not contact the judge objectively; thirdly, the whole axe was not overreacted or improperly used; fourthly, the lawyer openly apologized for the first time and made an apology to the court.
The combination of these circumstances, we can see that the lawyer involved "with ax to appear in court" has nothing to do with bad, just to defend.
After clarifying the whole facts, Quanzhou City Law Society did not push forward, but pressed against the pressure to make a decision not to punish.
And this decision, too, can stand the test of facts and laws.
As for without the court's permission, will be used as a tool to control the ax to the court, it is really easy to cause anxiety and misunderstanding.
For the sake of safety and prudent consideration, Quanzhou Zhongyuan's previous fine punishment and judicial suggestions are also understandable.
In order to safeguard the dignity of lawyers and prevent individual courts from making trouble with lawyers, the supreme law issued the "people's court rules for the security inspection of the judicial police" in 2014, establishing the principle that lawyers do not need to conduct physical security checks during court appearances.
Since the release of the rule, lawyers have been leading by example, with few incidents that jeopardize the court's security due to security breaches.
In very few cases like Quanzhou, as long as the spirit of mutual respect, understanding of communication, misunderstanding is not difficult to eliminate.
The Bar Association, as a self-regulatory organization in the bar industry, undertakes the dual mission of punishing lawlessness and safeguarding lawfulness.
In the past, individual organizations have been criticized for their emphasis on discipline and loss of protection.
The decision of the Quanzhou Bar Association, both from the process and the results, are commendable, for more of the correct performance of the bar association set an example.

Since the mid-2000s, as China's demand for oilseeds has grown, North Dakota farmer Paul Thomas has been growing more and more soybeans in his field.
The transformation reached its peak this year,when he planted 1,600 acres of soybeans in 5,000 acres,on a scale never seen before.
But Thomas and many farmers like him planned to change their staple crops in the former American agricultural regions in 2019: corn and wheat.
American farmers planted more soybeans this year than corn, for the first time in 35 years.
The planned conversion of other food crops is due to the plight of American farmers selling soybeans against the backdrop of a trade war launched by US President Donald Trump against China.
China usually buys about 60%of US soybeans, but it has fallen to a ten-year low in recent months as a result of a trade war that has seen almost zero purchases of US soybeans.
Thomas is planning to grow more wheat next year, hoping to earn more by reducing reliance on crops that depend on China's demand.
“The price of soybeans is "a painful blow," Thomas said .
He said the spot price for soybeans near his farm was 7.7 per bushel without a Chinese purchase. $ 10 while the cost of coverage is required for the price is 8. $ 50.
U.S. farmers are setting a record high in soybean acreage this year, and harvest is expected to reach a record high.
At a time when they were vulnerable, they were hit by a trade war.
In July, China imposed import duties on U.S. soybeans in response to Trump's tariffs on imports of Chinese goods.
The USDA will issue its first estimate of acreage next year, which will include consideration of the impact of tariffs.
It is expected that this estimate will confirm the expected reduction in sown area of soybeans by private institutions.
According to a report seen by Reuters, Informa Economics on October 19 predicted that in 2019 maize acreage will increase by 4%to 9,270 million acres(37.5 million hectares) and soybean acreage by 7% to 83 million acres.
Informa also expects a 4% increase in the area under wheat cultivation in the United States .
Soybeans grown before retaliatory tariffs rose to 8.96 million acres this year,about 15 million acres higher than 10 years ago.
Corn has grown on less than 5 million acres since 2008, to 891,100 acres, and this year it has grown to 47.8 million acres, the lowest level in 100 years.
Aron Carlson,president of the Illinois corn Association, has a total of 3,600 acres planted, and this year nearly half of him is growing soybeans, but he plans to cut them in the future.
He said he could grow corn by up to 20% on his farm in Northern Illinois , the largest soybean-growing state in the United States.
Soybeans yield per acre lower than corn, but the need for less fertilizer, which makes the overall cost of planting soybeans lower.
If farmers turn to the final value of corn, it may increase the cost, but will benefit some businesses, including Andersons Inc fertilizer sellers.
Andersons CEO Pat Bowe told Reuter that he expected the corn conversion to be beneficial for fertilizer use.
Bayer is also expected to benefit from farmers ' transfers of maize.

Xinhua International time assessment:to defend multilateralism, China is one.
International rules and the multilateral order are in the throes of a counter-current of unilateralism.
In a way, the clash between unilateralism and multilateralism has entered a crucial period.
As a large and responsible country, China is working with the international community to uphold multilateralism and push it forward with a strong and solid approach.
In the face of the new challenges of the new situation, China speaks loudly about the direction and path of multilateralism.
As state councilor and Minister for Foreign Affairs Wang Yi said in his speech at the 73rd UN General Assembly general debate, multilateralism in the new era should be oriented towards effective action, with the goal of win-win cooperation, with the rule of order as the foundation, with equity and justice as the tenor.
At the same time, China calls for a global development cooperation pattern that is complemented by the United Nations as the core, north-south cooperation as the main channel and South-South cooperation, and calls for all parties to work together to build a community of human destiny.
China's reflections and calls reflect the mainstream voice of the international community.
As president of the 73rd Session of the General Assembly, Espinoza said, in the current situation, "the United Nations needs more than ever to promote multilateralism and preserve the rules-based international system".
International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde said that the international community should continue to firmly uphold the multilateral trading system, adhere to international trade rules, through consultation to resolve differences.
In recent years, along with the adjustment of global economic and political forces, the rise of some emerging market and developing country groups has played a greater role in major international multilateral mechanisms and provided new development impetus to multilateralism.
Standing in this dimension considerations, China advocates the construction of large families rather than piecing together small circles, adhere to the concept of uniting constructs rather than win-take-all and other multilateral, conform to the trend of the Times, is the inevitable choice to meet global challenges, solve the world's problems, represents the common aspirations of most countries in the world.
There are advanced ideas, more solid action.
China's Belt and Road Initiative has become the largest international cooperation platform.
China initiated international and regional cooperation initiatives such as the“One Belt, One Road ” Initiative, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and “ 16 + 1 cooperation”to promote international regional cooperation, improve and supplement the existing international system and order, bring innovation and vitality to multilateral cooperation, and contribute to promoting the development of the international order towards a more just and reasonable direction.
As the maintainer of the international order and the practitioner of multilateralism, China has become increasingly vigorous in the multilateral arena of the United Nations.
Good offices to tackle international hotspots, address climate change, participate in peacekeeping operations, work to reduce poverty, and help other countries to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
As UN Secretary-General Guterres has said, China has become an important pillar of multilateralism.
When the world's“trust deficit”intensifies, when populism and polarization are on the rise, it is the world's most pressing need for multilateral cooperation.
At this historical juncture, the international community needs to work together to translate consensus into action, to firmly defend multilateralism and jointly promote the building of a community of human destiny.

On the evening of September 20th of this year,on the k158 train, in Zhengzhou, the three-year-old Joe went to Hebi by car.
A big uncle on the train bought a seatless ticket, but took her seat: ” shoot it."

From the public opinion, although the final results are mostly dominated by public condemnation, by the Public Security administrative punishment, and even into the integrity of the blacklist, but the public still do not feel "hate": why can not let the bazaoteer be punished on the spot?
Why can't they stop their unethical or even illegal actions on the spot, but punish them afterwards?
And for the unreasonable behavior of "bazhuo uncle", how is a male passenger "road to see the injustice" and drag it up?

This requires that our train Marshals dare to take strong measures in a timely manner, and trains without Marshals should be equipped with marshals as soon as possible, so as to prevent and combat violations in a timely manner.
