According to the British media, the US Navy Deputy Secretary of Operations General William Moran said that even though the US Navy is reinvigorating its forces to deal with increasingly worrying Russia on both sides of the Atlantic, the US still continues to extend the Asia-Pacific region - the Pentagon expands the scope of the region to include the Indian Ocean - Asia - the Pacific - as the naval focus.
According to a report on September 24 on the website of the British “Jane's Defense Weekly”, the United States listed China and Russia as strategic competitors in its new defense strategy announced at the beginning of the year.
Since then, the US Navy resumed its second fleet in order to counter Russian activities more directly.
According to the report, these moves caused some questions and concerns among allies and analysts, they fear that the US Navy may be far away from the “Asia-Pacific rebalancing” strategy that marks the Obama administration.
But Admiral Moran said that the focus of the US Navy is still on the Western Pacific Ocean.
“There has been no major change for us,” he said at a round-table discussion entitled “Meeting the High Seas Challenge,” hosted by the National Asian Research Agency in Washington, D.C., on January 24, 2018. ”
“The focus is still on rebalancing, shifting the center of gravity or whatever you want to describe it. ”
However, he admitted that the United States has close ties with Europe.
“We will continue to focus on the growth of the West Coast and balance what we can do,” he said. ”
Although Moran pointed out that the overall policy on Russia falls within the purview of the US Secretary of Defense, he warned: “Russians may face demographic and economic challenges, but history proves that if we conflict with them, they will be very tough. ”
Admiral Moran said that as part of the resurrection of the United States against Russia, China and other competitors, the US Navy is dynamically deploying troops into a “new mode of combat”, which will help make the opponent unprepared about where the US aircraft carrier battle group or other assets will be deployed at any given time and place.
He said: “We Navy and Marine Corps support it - the concept of unpredictability of combat, don't appear in the same place again and again, almost like clockwork - this is our approach. ”
The report said that the first attempt to try this new approach was the “Harry Truman” aircraft carrier combat group, the early deployment of the group included working visits to the port and patrolling the area normally only through.
Moran said that the US Navy is currently working to ensure that allies know that these warships will still patrol the traditional area, and is also resolving logistics and family liaison issues for the new deployment procedures.
Admiral Michael Nunan, commander of the Royal Australian Navy, also made a speech at this event, saying that the Australian army could cooperate seamlessly with the American aircraft carrier battle group.
He said that this situation will continue as the Royal Australian Navy plans to purchase nine additional frigates equipped with “Aegis” combat systems.

The CPPCC National Committee held a symposium on important ideological and theoretical thinking on strengthening and improving the work of the CPPCC.
The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) held a symposium on important ideological and theoretical aspects of strengthening and improving the work of the CPPCC.
Wang Yang, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, attended the meeting.
He stressed that Xi Jinping's important thinking on strengthening and improving the work of the CPPCC has clearly clarified the status role, objectives, tasks, duties, mission and practical requirements of the CPPCC. Scientifically answers a series of major issues of direction, overall and strategic nature, and is a powerful ideological weapon to guide the work of the CPPCC in the new era.
We should carefully study and implement this important idea, grasp its significance, enrich its content and spiritual substance, and actually work hard on learning and understanding, and do practical work, with theoretical learning and ideological arming to promote the quality of the work of the CPPCC, and effectively assume the new mission of the CPPCC in the new era.
From September 29 to 30, the CPPCC National Committee held a symposium on important ideological and theoretical aspects of strengthening and improving the work of the CPPCC in Beijing.
Wang Yang pointed out that since the 18th National Congress of the Party, Xi Jinping has put forward a series of new ideas and new ideas on strengthening and improving the work of the CPPCC. For the first time, the CPPCC is an important channel and a special consultative body for socialist consultation and democracy, an important part of the country's governance system, an institutional arrangement with Chinese characteristics.The relationship of diversity profoundly reveals that the true essence of people's democracy is that things are well negotiated and people are consulted by all. It reveals the logical link between the “rule of China” and the Chinese political system. It is the latest achievement of the Party's CPPCC theory.
Wang Yang stressed that the CPPCC at all levels should take theoretical learning and discussion as an opportunity to further identify weak links and shortcomings in the CPPCC work, and work hard to improve and achieve breakthroughs.
We must comprehensively strengthen the Party's construction in the CPPCC system and ensure that the decision making and deployment of the Party Central Committee will be carried out in the CPPCC work.
It is necessary to strengthen ideological and political leadership, improve the system, procedures and mechanisms for “two-way force” for the development of opinions and management, and consolidate consensus, so that ideological and political leadership can be implemented into all aspects and the whole process of the performance of duties.
We should focus on the central task and fulfill our duties and responsibilities, better obey the overall situation of the Party and the state, improve the quality of the leadership and management, and enhance the effectiveness of the performance of duties.
The CPPCC should strengthen its own building, take good care of the education and training of members and cadres, play the fundamental role of the special committee, and strengthen the basis for the performance of the CPPCC's functions.
We need to strengthen guidance on the work of the local CPPCC, orienting, demonstrating, solving difficult problems, and improving the overall level of CPPCC work.

People's Beijing, November 5 (Wang Xiaoyan) in the current “mass entrepreneurship, innovation” wave, more and more technology companies began to pay attention to patent research and development and related protection work, deepen the potential value of patents, occupy market dominance.
In the same vein, many technology enterprises have experienced a lot of infringement in patented technology licensing and use of patented technology.
At the end of 2017, Tan Wei, He Zhanghong and Lai Bin from Guangdong Province filed a patent infringement application developer Beijing Xiaoban Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Xiaoban Technology), operator Didi Travel Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Didi Travel Travel) and vendor Guangdong Pacific Internet Information Service Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Guangdong Pacific) to Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.).
The three plaintiffs requested the court to order that the three defendants immediately stop manufacturing, selling, promising sale, and using the plaintiff's patents.
On October 30, 2018, the Chinese referee's website published “Tan Wei, He Zhanghong and Beijing Xiaoqiao Technology Co., Ltd.” It disclosed the details of some cases of patent infringement.
The three plaintiffs argued that the patent owner and inventor of the “mobile device based carpooling service system and method” and that the entire operation of the “windmill” application in the “drip” app corresponded to the technical scheme of patent protection, and constituted patent infringement.
However, during the court decision, Orange Technology held that Guangdong Pacific was not a qualified defendant. It only provided free download of the APP “drip” on the Internet, did not implement the patent method involved, and there was no direct or indirect infringement, and should not be listed as the defendant in the case.
Secondly, the place of violation in this case is not in Guangdong.
According to the law, the place of infringement of the patent should be the place where the patent method in question was fully implemented. Therefore, the jurisdiction of the court was challenged and the case was transferred to the court of residence of the defendant, the Beijing Intellectual Property Court.
The Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court held that the defendant Guangdong Pacific provided an APP product for alleged infringement on its online platform and that the plaintiff listed the defendant Guangdong Pacific as a defendant.
The defendant, Guangdong Pacific, whose domicile is in Guangzhou, is within the jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
Defendant Xiaoban Technology argued that the case should be transferred to the Beijing Intellectual Property Court for trial. On the basis of shortcomings, the defendant Xiaoban Technology Co., Ltd. rejected the objection to the jurisdiction of the case.
At present, the other trial status of the case has not yet been released. The reporter will also closely monitor the details of the Didi travel patent infringement case.
Interview with Chief Executive Officer of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization of Australia: remarkable achievements in Australia-China science and technology cooperation
“China's science and technology have developed rapidly over the past few decades, and Australia and China can achieve fruitful results in the field of science. ”
Larry Marshall, chief executive officer of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization of Australia, said in an exclusive interview with China News Agency reporter in Beijing a few days ago, Australia and China's cooperation in the field of science and technology has shown a vitality.
CSIRO, the largest national research institute in the Commonwealth of Australia, has achieved many innovative research achievements in the fields of oceans, energy, biology, materials and astronomy.
CSIRO has maintained close cooperation with scientific institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
“It is a lasting friendship that embraces a tradition of trust in partners and long-term cooperation. “Marshall said.
In May this year, China's 500-metre spherical radio telescope, “China Sky Eye”, installed the international first 19-beam L-band receiver.
This is the world's most advanced 19-beam-feed receiver, jointly developed by Chinese and Australian scientists.
Marshall said the receiver's successful development is based on CSIRO's many years of technology accumulation, and the FAST survey speed will be increased by five to six times, while expanding more scientific observation targets.
“This is CSIRO's contribution to FAST. ”
In addition to the above cooperation, CSIRO has cooperated closely with Chinese scientific institutions in the construction of square-kilometer array radio telescopes, development of new fuel technologies, energy saving and emission reduction.
“Scientific research in the past tended to focus on problems hundreds of years later, and now more research is needed to solve the problems that lie ahead. ”
Marshall believes that Australia and China are complementary in the field of scientific development. At the same time, both countries face a series of challenges in development.
For example, extreme weather conditions are frequent globally, droughts and floods have led to reduced food production, which has seriously affected human development.
At the same time, the problems of population explosion, ageing and chronic diseases are also serious challenges.
“The cooperation between Australia and China in recent years has focused on solving these current challenges,” he said. ”
Marshall said CSIRO and Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology will focus on observing the El Niño and La Niña phenomena, studying the relationship between them and extreme weather, and establishing an early warning facility for extreme weather. CSIRO and CAS jointly developed new grains to overcome extreme weather conditions.The problem of food shortages.
“In the current environment, technology and innovation are difficult to accomplish on its own, costs are very high, and there are many issues to be solved, so cooperation is particularly important today. ”
Marshall said that the closer the cooperation will be, the more likely breakthrough progress, which is also the significance of enhancing cooperation between Australia and China under the Belt and Road framework.
“Strengthening bilateral cooperation is mainly for us in the area of science and technology. ”
Marshall, for example, CSIRO recently developed a gold purification method that does not use cyanide, because the traditional cyanide gold purification method is very harmful to the environment, many countries want to find a low environmental pollution gold purification method.
“We are very willing to introduce this technology into China, which is one of the results of our participation in the Belt and Road Initiative. ”

North Korea's Foreign Minister Lee Yong-ho said to the United Nations on Saturday that the continued imposition of sanctions would deepen North Korea's distrust of the United States, and North Korea could not unilaterally give up nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
At the UN General Assembly, Lee Yong Hao said that the DPRK had adopted “very friendly practices” in the past year, including stopping missiles and nuclear tests, dismantling nuclear test sites, and committing itself to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“But we did not see any corresponding response from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security. Under such circumstances, we cannot first give up weapons unilaterally. ”
Although Lee Yong Hao repeats North Korea's complaint about the United States's opposition to “phased” denuclearization, his speech is of great significance because he did not completely refuse unilateral denuclearization as North Korea did before.
Lee Yong-ho referred to the joint statement of Kim Jong-un and Trump on June 12, when Kim Jong-un agreed to work towards the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula” and Trump promised to protect North Korea's security.
North Korea has always sought to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States claimed that North Korea must give up nuclear weapons first.
The United States also refused to loosen international sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
“The United States insists on “denuclearization first”, and has increased pressure on sanctions to achieve its objectives in a high-pressure manner, and even refuses to issue a declaration on the end of the war,” said Li Yonghao.
“The idea that sanctions can make us kneel for forgiveness is that those who do not know us are dreaming.
But the problem is that such continued sanctions are deepening our mistrust. ”
Li Yonghao did not mention the plan for the second special gold conference mentioned earlier this week by the US President at the United Nations.
Instead, he highlighted the three meetings between Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Wen Jae-in over the past five months and said: “If the other party to denuclearization is South Korea, not North Korea, then the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will not become so deadlocked. ”
China announced that, effective November 1, 2018, it will reduce import tariffs for 1,585 duty items.
Since this year, China has successively taken the initiative to reduce import tariffs.
On May 1 of this year, all general drugs, including anti-cancer drugs, alkaloids that have anti-cancer effects, and proprietary Chinese medicines with actual imports, were adjusted to zero.
At the same time, it also significantly reduced the VAT burden on the production and import of anti-cancer drugs.
On July 1, 218 tax items were reduced on automobiles and spare parts.
After the tax cut, the tax rate for Chinese automobile vehicles has been lower than the average for developing countries, which is in line with the actual reality of China's automobile industry.
The tax cut will drive the industry restructuring and resource optimization, accelerate the success and quality of products and services. It is expected that the price adjustment of cars will be pushed to a certain extent, so that consumers will receive more benefits.
On July 1, the tax was reduced on 1,449 items of daily consumption.
Tax reductions on consumer goods are closely linked to the needs of people for a better life.
This tax reduction is not only large but also strong, with an average tax reduction of 56%.
Tax cuts on consumer goods directly benefit consumers and promote the competitiveness of domestic industries.
On November 1, a tax reduction will be imposed on 1,585 industrial products such as mechanical and electrical equipment, spare parts and raw materials.
Appropriately lowering import tariffs on some of the most needed domestic industrial products can attract more foreign investment, help increase domestic supply and boost industrial upgrading. At the same time, enterprises can allocate resources globally, reduce production costs and reduce the pressure on the domestic environment.
Relevant officials from the Customs Tax Committee Office of the State Council of China introduced that the above four independent tax reductions, as well as the third step tax reduction implemented on July 1 this year in accordance with the results of negotiations on expanding the scope of information technology agreement, will bring China's total tariff level down from 9.8% last year to 7.5 percent.
The overall level of adjusted tariffs is slightly higher than that of the European Union, lower than most developing countries, and is at a moderate low level, which is basically commensurate with China's developing country status and stage of development.
The person in charge introduced, the total tariff level as one of the important indicators of the openness of China's goods trade field, should be adapted to the stage of China's economic development, reflecting the characteristics of the times.
China's trade in goods, which is the largest in the world, has an economic basis for further expansion of openness, but there is still a gap in the quality and efficiency of trade development compared with the developed economies, and therefore the overall level of tariffs should be appropriately reduced.
Tariff is a means of protecting compliance. Tariff levels should be commensurate with the competitiveness of industries. Proper competition should be encouraged and excessive protection is detrimental to industrial development and quality improvement.
Tariff adjustment should take into account production and consumption needs.
Emphasis has been placed on reducing the tariff rates for commodities with large domestic demand and contributing to the transformation and upgrading of industries. Efforts have been made to increase the import of niche products with strong demand among the people, and to continuously enhance the sense of acquisition by enterprises and the public, and meet the upgrading needs of industrial and consumer structures.
The tax reduction should take into account fiscal income and the affordability of industrial development.
In the selection of specific items and ranges of tax reduction, we should coordinate the relationship between domestic and foreign markets, upstream and downstream aspects, production and consumption, and maintain China's economic growth momentum.
The person in charge stressed that this year marks the 40th anniversary of the reform and opening up. China's initiative to reduce the total level of import tariffs is based on China's own need to achieve high-quality development. It is conducive to the integrated use of both international and foreign resources, to promote the quality of the domestic supply system and to meet the consumer upgrading needs of the people.

Serbian-Russian President will meet tomorrow to discuss the situation in Kosovo
The Tanjug news agency quoted the Serbian President's Office as saying that Serbian President Vucic ordered the country's armed forces to enter the state of maximum readiness in view of the occupation by Kosovo special forces of the passage of the Ghazivodda hydroelectric station in northern Kosovo controlled by Belgrade.
On 29 September, Serbian Minister of Defence, Vulin, declared that the Serbian army was on full operational readiness.
Vulin stressed that as long as the orders issued by Vučić remain in force, Serbia will continue to monitor the current situation in Kosovo, regardless of the direction of the situation, the Serb army will respond.
According to a report from the Russian Tas News Agency, on September 29, Vucci said in an interview that he had informed the United States, Russia and Europe of the current situation, and would go to Moscow on October 2 to meet with Russian President Putin to seek Putin's support on the Kosovo issue.
When asked whether Serbia needed Russian military support like Syria, Vučić responded in the negative: “I do not want a major military conflict on our territory. ”
Vučić also stated that the SLA had entered full operational readiness only to form a deterrent to the conflict, but it was also a clear warning that no violence would ever be tolerated in Kosovo.
The increase in the operational readiness of the Serb army is related to two major moves by the Kosovo side.
According to the Serbian side, in recent days Albanians have been making extensive arrests in northern Kosovo of ethnic Serbs who have lived there for generations, and those arrested Serbs have not violated any law.
Vucic said that since March 26 of this year, Marko Jurić, head of the Serbian government office in Kosovo and Metohija, was beaten and detained by the Kosovo Albanian army, ethnic Albanians have escalated regional events and carried out inhumane arrests and deportations of Serbs.
In addition, more than 100 people, including the recently self-proclaimed ROSU special forces of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Kosovo, armed police and snipers, occupied positions near the water storage lake of the Ghazvoda hydroelectric station, entered the ecological and sports centre near the dam in the northern part of Kosovo and blocked all nearby roads, which were otherwise controlled by the Serbian side.
Vučić pointed out that this military adventure in Kosovo was carried out with the encouragement of Western countries. The actions of the Kosovo army did not inform the Serbian side in advance, in violation of Chapter IX, paragraph 1, of the Brussels Agreement, as well as the UN Security Council Resolution 1244 and the military technical agreement between Secko.
Vučić has already shouted to NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg, criticizing Western countries for hypocrisy rhetoric on Kosovo.
The root cause of this conflict is still the centuries-old rancour between the Serb and Albanian communities in Kosovo.
There are separate accounts of Kosovo's belonging to Serbs and Albanians.
Serbia sees Kosovo as the birthplace of ethnicity and the cradle of culture, where Serbia established its strongest State in the 12th century, and where Albanians migrated in large numbers only after the Ottoman invasion and the retreat of the Serb forces in the north.
Albanians insist that the primitive tribe of the Illyrians inhabited in Kosovo in the 4-5 centuries BC were ethnic Albanians and that, as a result, Kosovo has been Albanian territory since ancient times.
Subjective political divisions have led to intense clashes between different ethnic groups, religions and cultures, resulting in a fierce confrontation between Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo.
In 1912, Kosovo Albanians first proclaimed the independence of Albania.
After the First World War, a large number of Albanians living in the Balkans moved to Turkey, and the proportion of Serbs rose relatively. In the view of the Serbs, the practice of “just taking back their own land” was seen by the Albanians as plundered by the “Greater Serbianism” and the conflict between the two communities intensified.
Kosovo became the “powder keg” in the Balkans.
In 1999, an armed clash between Albanian separatists from the Kosovo Liberation Army and the Serbian army and police led to the bombing of the Federal Republic of Serbia and Montenegro by NATO forces and the outbreak of war in Kosovo.
On 17 February 2008, Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia.
Since then, although news came out that Serbia would normalize relations with Kosovo and sign a global and legally binding agreement, it was not possible to sign the agreement of various forces, such as the United States, Europe and Russia, due to historical ethnic grievances and geopolitical constraints.
And just a month ago, Vucic, for the first time, made it clear that it advocated the separation of Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo and once again openly the contradictions between the two communities.
Power Communication Still Disrupts Indonesia Strong Earthquake and Tsunami Rescue Difficulties
According to figures released by the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency in the early morning of the 30th, a strong earthquake and tsunami triggered in Donggara County, Central Sulawesi Province, on the 28th, killed 420 people.

Many of the city's hotels, shopping malls, warehouses and other heavily staffed buildings damaged by the earthquake collapse have not been searched and rescued because of the lack of large search and rescue machinery.
Local time on September 29, 2018, Ba, Indonesia, a bridge destroyed by an earthquake and tsunami collapsed into several festivals.
Due to the severe damage to electricity and communications facilities, the district of Donggara in the epicenter and the neighboring Xigi area are still unconnected “islands” and cannot count the number of victims.
This media report, Indonesian Vice President Kara said the death toll may reach thousands.
Power interruptions, communications interruptions, road interruptions, airport damage... Rescue efforts in the aftermath of severe earthquakes and tsunamis are difficult.
Due to power disruptions, some hospitals and rescue settlements in Palu city need to be powered by fuel.
The roads in and out of the city were blocked by landslides and large transport vehicles, including tankers, were unable to enter the city, making fuel supply strained.
Indonesian Social Minister Agus said that because of road damage, the ministry transferred tents, mattress, blankets, clothes, food, household goods kits and other emergency relief supplies from the neighboring provinces of South Sulawesi and Colomtalo have not yet arrived in the disaster area.
Relief materials transferred from the capital, Jakarta, are being transported to the disaster area via air transport aircraft.
In view of the damage to the command tower and runway at Palu Airport during the earthquake, all commercial flights were grounded for the take-off and landing of military aircraft transporting relief supplies and personnel only.
The Indonesian political, legal and security affairs co-ordinator minister in charge of rescue in the earthquake zone Wiranto demanded that electricity supply and airport commercial flights be resumed as soon as possible, to ensure the operation of the hospital and other rescue agencies, so that more relief workers and volunteers, aid supplies can reach the disaster area.

Beijing, Beijing, October 1 (reporter Yin Li) sky such as wash, clear sky, Cai Xia full day... Recently, Beijing continued to open the most beautiful blue sky mode, attracted thousands of people on social platforms fancy show, in continuous swipe screen sun happiness, said “blue sky, drunk” skyline, this is the best business card in Beijing ".
Since August, Beijing ushered in the “blue sky”.
Within the capital city, you can see people at any time and anywhere, holding a smartphone or holding a SLR camera to take pictures.
Weibo, WeChat circle of friends and other social platforms, everywhere can be seen in the Imperial Palace, Tiananmen, bird's nest, hutong... all kinds of buildings in the blue sky to show different beauty.
Some netizens said, such “scenery big” is the best city propaganda film in Beijing; and netizens ridicule said, if such a blue sky for a long time, cervical spondylosis can be cured; more netizens hope “this smear blue can meet the spring and summer, let the sky of the capital four seasons blue”.
Why the capital people love to sun the blue sky?
Only because the people who lived in this city in the past suffered from the haze, this is particularly eager for the blue sky, and in Beijing launched a “battle of blue sky” to continuously improve air quality, the haze becomes less, the blue sky increases, the people look happy in their eyes, get a sense of happiness is also particularly weighty.
On the day of the National Day, Beijing weather is fine.
At 8:00 a.m., the vast majority of the 35 air quality monitoring stations in the city are shown as “Grade 1” green.
The “Blue Sky” theme photo contest on social platforms is still ongoing.
Why is the sky in Beijing so blue?
According to the relevant officials of the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau, in August this year, the average concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in Beijing was 35 μg/m3, setting the best record in the past five years.
The real time concentration of PM2.5 in September is more frequent single digits.
A major factor in the emergence of the “bluest skies” is the overall favorable weather conditions in recent times. More importantly, Beijing has consistently carried out air pollution control, vigorously promoted the clean air action plan over the past five years, and the continuous release of environmental benefits, resulting in a reduction in total amount of pollutant emissions in the region, all laying the foundation for a sustained improvement in air quality.
In 2013, Beijing officially launched and implemented the Beijing Clean Air Action Plan 2013-2017.
According to the plan, the official continued to guide non-capital functional solutions, promote energy cleaner substitution and pollution reduction, eliminating a total of 4923 coal-fired boilers.
Beijing has thus become the first big city in mainland China to realize the whole network of natural gas.
Data show that between 2013 and 2017, the average annual concentration of PM2.5 in Beijing decreased by 35.6%; the number of days reached the standard of air quality increased by 50 days; the number of days increased by 25 days; the number of days of heavy pollution decreased by 35 days; the incidence of heavy pollution decreased significantly.
At the same time as the air quality continues to improve, Beijing officially released a three-year action plan to win the Blue Sky Defense War in September this year, focusing on key prevention areas such as diesel trucks, dust and volatile organic matter management, optimizing the transportation structure, industrial structure, energy structure and land use structure, and strengthening the regional coalition defense alliances.Control, focus on strengthening the meticulous management of the city, promote green development in all its aspects, strive to make the “blue sky” resident in the capital, no longer “things are precious”, let it return to the background of people's album and not the protagonist.
During this year's National Day Golden Week, relevant departments such as the City Tourism Commission, Industry and Commerce, Urban Administration, and Public Security will strengthen enforcement checks on the “one-day tour” market, focusing on the “six black” chaos in tourism. Once the violators have been identified, they will be given strict and superimposed penalties in accordance with the law.
Yesterday morning, the city government held a special meeting on combating illegal “day trip” to further severely fight illegal “day trip” special action to make deployment.
At the meeting, focusing on the intertwined “six black” chaos of black ticket, black guide, black club, black car, black shop and black net interests chain, the city launched a special action to combat illegal “day trip” since July 28.
Since the launch of special action, the city has received 39 complaints of “day trip”, down 63%. Since this year, the city has received 270 complaints of “day trip”, down 62%.
In the past two months, the city seized 248 “black cars”, investigated and punished 158 tourist passenger business violations, closed shopping “black shops” and performing arts venues 29, investigated and punished “black clubs” 13, “black guide” 27 people, confiscated 26,000 illegal advertising, dismantled the law “one-day trip” billboards 31, bus fake station signs, investigated and dealt with all kinds of travel-related illegal acts 1789 cases established by various functional departments181 cases, ranging from a heavy fine of 4.48 million yuan, and 111 people were detained in violation of the law.
After the rectification, the illegal “day trip” chaos were basically contained, and the “day trip” market order showed a steady trend towards good.
According to the introduction, in recent years the city has continuously stepped up the illegal “day trip”.
In 2016 and 2017, the city tourism commission accepted “one-day trip” complaints 1612 and 897 complaints, down 79% and 44% respectively, but illegal “one-day trip” still repeatedly hit, often rebound, and formed black ticket, black guide, black club, black car, black shop, black net and other interests chain intertwined “six black” mess.
Specifically, illegal street visitors are “black tickets”, illegal websites that publish false travel information, “black networks”, travel agencies or individuals that do not have the qualifications of travel agencies or travel agencies that do not have the qualifications to operate, or “black clubs”, and guides employed by “black clubs” who do not have a guide card or practice illegal, use vehicles that are not qualified for tourist passengers or are illegal “day trips”.Passenger transport vehicles qualified as “black cars” and eventually they bring visitors to the designated tourist shopping mall, “black shops”.
In this special action, the city has continuously stepped up its regular inspection and mobile inspection of illegal “day trips”. In response to illegal “day trips” high-frequency and high-impact tourist route locations, relevant departments dispatched daily unannounced teams on the bus to visit the group, and found evidence of illegal violations, and strictly investigated and punished in accordance with the law.
Among them, “black car” and “black shop” became two of the focus of special action.
According to introduction, without a black car, illegal “day trip” can not be carried out. The black car is easily discovered, remembered and investigated, and is also a fixed asset with a high value.
Relevant departments use road traffic monitoring probes to increase the supervision of the tourist bus on the key “day trip” line, using technology and defense, physical defense and other intelligent means can detect and investigate the “black car” in a timely manner.
Tourism shopping “black shop” has become a serious focus because of its small number and sitting in business.
In order to strengthen the deterrence and crackdown on illegal “day trips”, whenever the violation of the law is found in special actions, all functional departments will always impose heavy and strict superimposed penalties in accordance with the law.
In August this year, the city also held a seminar on legal issues related to the strict fight against illegal “day trip”, which discussed measures to combine administrative penalties and convictions.
The City Tourism Commission said that in the future, more regular travel agencies will be encouraged to carry out “one-day trips” in Beijing, increasing the supply of official “one-day trips” to further squeeze out the living space of illegal “one-day trips”. At present, specific plans are still under study.
In addition, the City Tourism Commission has continuously improved the information system for tours to ensure that each team is included in the electronic itinerary platform.

At the same time, Tongxiang City, where Wuzhen is located, is the first county city in the country to build a dedicated Internet data channel, also becomes a hot ground for Internet industry development.
Since the first World Internet Congress, Tongxiang has introduced a total of 565 digital economy projects, with a total investment of 37.725 billion yuan. In the first three quarters of this year, the value added increased by 13%.

Tsunami caused by the earthquake in Indonesia has killed at least 410 people
According to the director of the public information bureau of the Jakarta police in Indonesia on the evening of the 29th, the earthquake in Central Sulawesi province has killed 410 people, of which 97 have been identified.
Another 29 people were missing and 540 were injured.
Palu airport remains closed.
Active treatment, the survival rate of premature infants 29 weeks or more in China reached 98 per cent, which has reached the level of developed countries.
Chinanehai, September 30 (Chen Jing, Luo Yanqian) National Children's Medical Center and Pediatric Hospital of Fudan University disclosed on the 30th that they introduced Canada's advanced methods in the lead “China NICU Hospital Premature Infants Quality Improvement Project”.
According to the results of the project, the survival rate of 29 weeks and older premature infants in China reached 98 per cent, which has reached the level of developed countries, but there is still room for improvement in the survival rate of premature infants and premature infants without complications.
For nearly 20 years, the Chinese Government has been paying attention to the treatment of newborns.
At present, the infant mortality rate in Shanghai has fallen to 3.71 per thousand, which is significantly below the national average, reaching the advanced level of developed countries.
The Prognostic Quality Improvement Project of NICU Hospitalized Premature Infants in China has significantly improved the quality of life of premature infants through four years of unremitting efforts.
Professor Cao Yun, director of the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of the Pediatric Hospital of Fudan University, told reporters that while improving the survival rate of premature infants, reducing the incidence of complications, improving the prognosis of neurological development and improving the overall outcome of premature infants, it is important to improve the overall survival quality of premature infants and population.It is also a key issue for the project.
Through four years of unremitting efforts, the China NICU Premature Infants' Prognosis Quality Improvement Project included tens of thousands of premature infants aged 33 weeks and below. This led to a decrease of 1/3 in the number of premature infants in the country and a significant decrease in the incidence of severe complications in premature infants, which significantly improved the quality of life of premature infants.
Through the establishment of a nationwide network for quality improvement of newborns and the introduction of collaborative quality improvement concepts, the project radiates 25 cooperative hospitals across China, and establishes a comprehensive, systematic and effective collaborative quality improvement method for improving the prognosis of premature infants and improving the level of care for newborns.
The Affiliated Paediatric Hospital of Fudan University is working with the national neonatology team to develop guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections in China.
It is learned that in the “Quality Improvement Project for Premature Infants in China”, paediatric hospitals introduced the EPIQ method to 25 large NICU in 19 provinces in China to solve the premature infants infection problem that plagued China's newborn care unit.
After more than 10 years of improvement, Canada's national premature survival rate has increased by about 1/3, and Canada is now among the best preterm prognosis in the world.
The EPIQ methodology has now been applied to all NICU in Canada and has been adopted in six countries.
Pediatric hospitals revealed that two years after EPIQ intervention, infection in premature infants decreased by 35 percent, while antibiotic use decreased by 20 percent.
In the future, the Paediatric Hospital of Fudan University will continue to promote and implement this method nationwide, with a view to reducing the incidence of all complications in premature infants and improving the quality of care for newborns throughout the country.
At present, it is a fact that there are differences and uneven levels of treatment in different regions of China.
According to Professor Cao Yun, as an important building unit of the National Children's Medical Center, paediatric hospitals will play a leading role in radiation. This study covers several western provinces such as Xinjiang, Guizhou, Gansu and Shaanxi, with a view to gradually promoting homogenization and standardization of neonatal care throughout the country.
According to information, the Paediatric Hospital of Fudan University is working with the national neonatology team to develop guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections, which will provide reference and guidance for the standardized diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections in China.
In 2019, the coordination center is located at the Pediatric Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University, and will work with 63 hospitals across the country to carry out the next stage of national quality improvement, with a view to promoting the development of homogeneous treatment levels in China.
Wu Jinglei, director of Shanghai Health and Planning Commission, said that Shanghai can become a central city in Asia, not only in research, but also in the construction of the entire service system, service quality and service results should have a place in Asia, thus truly reflecting China's medical standard.
Xin Zhiping: Build the heart of the “hero monument” — written on the fifth martyr anniversary day.
On September 30, on the eve of the birth of the 69-year-old Chinese Republic, we ushered in the fifth martyr anniversary day. Xi Jin's Parity Party and State leaders came to Tiananmen Square to attend the flower basket ceremony to pay tribute to the people's heroes.
Here and now, wherever you may be, pay tribute to your honor.
Anniversary, is relive, and even more awakens.
Turning over the thick history, behind the name of every martyr, is a living life.
They, too, have fiery youth, have sincere love, have concerned family.
However, because they believed that “the doctrine of our faith is the truth of the universe”, they were willing to sacrifice everything for themselves in order to “free the suffering of the next generation.”
“If I survive a day, I shout a day for China.”
Through time and space, the Youngmen set up a spiritual sign to guide the way forward.
“Where to come from, where to go” “What kind of person” to read and understand enerously, it is not difficult to get an answer.
The most important thing is the erection of a “monument to heroes” in the heart.
According to incomplete statistics, about 20 million martyrs have died valiantly for national independence, the liberation of the people, and the prosperity and strength of the country since the revolutionary war years.
For various reasons, many martyrs did not even leave their names.
Countless heroic watered ideals with blood, practicing faith with life, remembering their English name, passing on their spirit, is to protect the roots and soul of the nation.
This “Heroes Monument” is not allowed for any defilement or destruction.
For some time now, historical nihilism, pan-entertainment and other undercurrents have swung.
Various practices that distort history and degrade heroism, challenge the conscience of justice and misjudge value, cause public indignation and alarm throughout society.
Heroes cannot be blasphemy, heroes can not forget.
Behaviour that touches the bottom line must not be allowed, and must dare to light the sword and defend the dignity of dignity with justice under the rule of law.
On May 1 this year, the Law on the Protection of Heroic Martyrs was officially implemented.
Judging from judicial practice, the judgments in some cases are very fast and popular. Both effectively protect the brilliant image in accordance with the law, and release the positive energy of adoring heroes and adoring the martyrs.
A people seeking cannot live without heroes, and an ideal country cannot live without vanguard.
The memory of the martyrs and the call for heroes has become a common social consensus.
At present, there are a total of millions of commemorative facilities throughout the country, and more than 100 million people visit the Martyrs' Cemetery every year.
The human heart is the most solid cornerstone.
Let heroes, defending heroes, learning heroes, caring heroes, let the heroic spirit into the blood of the nation, a “heroes monument” will stand firmly between heaven and earth, deep in the hearts of people.
Reuters Brussels, September 28 - After Italy defies EU requirements, with a massive budget deficit plan to make the market surprised, the EU on Friday took a non-confrontational stance against Italy, but if Italy adheres to too bold goals, the EU may take a more radical stance.
The Italian Government's goal is to have a budget deficit equivalent to 2.4 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) over the next three years, indicating that debt cuts have not been made even in the face of the deficit reduction requirements.
“We are not interested in the crisis between the Executive Committee and Italy,” said the EU's proposal and sanctions may have little effect on Italy, he took a cautious response.
EU officials and diplomats still hope that market forces will be able to convince Italy to adjust its budget plan before it is officially submitted to the EU Executive Committee in mid-October.
After the government announced its plan, the euro fell to its lowest level in nearly two weeks on Friday, while Italian bond yields hit the highest in three weeks.
If the deficit target remains unchanged before the October deadline, the EU Executive Committee may reject Italy's draft budget, something that the Executive Committee has never done to any country.
EU Executive Committee Vice Chairman Donbulovsky said later on Friday at a meeting in the Latvian capital Riga that Italy's current fiscal plan “seems to be inconsistent with the Stability and Growth Pact”, referring to the EU's fiscal regulations.
But he did not say how this would trigger the reaction of the EU.
Tenders may submit their applications for participation in the public tender before 26 October this year.

National film free cotton field observation and seminar exchange experts walked into the test field to hear a presentation by the representative of the team of academician Yu Shuxun of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.
Beijing, xinjiang sayya September 30 (Geng Dan Wang Xiaojun) is located in xinjiang shaya county non-membrane cotton planting test base, no film cotton growth, and next to the film cotton “no less”, a cluster of snow-white cotton race “open”, hanging with branches.
From September 27 to 28, the national film cotton field observation and seminar exchange activities were held in Shaya County, Xinjiang.
At the observation meeting, the reporter learned that the non-membrane cotton technology system, based on “Chinese cotton 619" and its accompanying cultivation measures, has initially achieved the goal of film-free cultivation in cotton fields, reduced the pollution of ecological environment and raw cotton by residue film in Xinjiang, and significant progress has been made in the research and demonstration of the comprehensive technology of non-membrane cotton.
Academician Yu Shuxun, a well-known cotton genetic breeder and chief scientist of the State Modern Agricultural Industry Technology System, introduced the growth of nonmembrane cotton to Zhou Guomo, Secretary of the Party Committee of Zhejiang Agriculture and Forestry University.
“Our comprehensive technology of non-membrane cotton can completely achieve cotton without ground film cultivation, and can completely solve the problem of residual film contamination and achieve green cotton planting. ”
Introduction by Yu Shuxun, Academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.
Xinjiang is the most important cotton producing region in China. According to statistics from the National Bureau of Statistics, Xinjiang cotton cultivation in 2017 was 35 million mu, accounting for 61% of the country's cotton area.
Since the introduction of film in China in 1982, Xinjiang has covered more than 50 million acres of crops, and the annual use of the film is about 300,000 tons.
Among them, cotton film coverage reached 100%, and cotton field film accounted for about 60% of the film use in Xinjiang.
Film-free cotton production, cotton production can be achieved from 320 kilograms to 350 kilograms.
With the increasing amount of film input in Xinjiang, the recovery rate of residual film is low, the amount of residual film in the soil is gradually increasing, and the damage of soil structure caused by the residual film is seriously affecting the sustainable development of agriculture.
Residual membranes not only cause significant contamination of the soil, but also have a significant impact on the quality of cotton fiber.
Currently, more than 1/3 of the cotton fields in Xinjiang have been mechanized.
In 2017, Xinjiang machine cotton mining area is about 14 million acres.
The film doped in raw cotton is difficult to remove during raw cotton processing and cannot be completely removed during subsequent textile processing, which seriously affects the quality of textile products.
On September 28, the national membrane cotton scene observation and discussion exchange activities were held in Shaya County, Xinjiang.
To focus on solving the contamination of cotton fields, simplify cotton cultivation technology and improve the efficiency of cotton fields, Yu Shuxun led his team through eight years to implement “China Cotton 619" non-membrane cotton technology planting, adding a wing to the green development of Xinjiang agriculture.
Yu Shuxun introduced, through innovative breeding new ideas, to cultivate a new lineage of cotton “Cotton 619".
Under the conditions of non-film-free cultivation in southern Xinjiang, “Cotton 619" achieves a series of supporting measures such as the mechanical matching of non-membrane sowing, improved seeding depth, shallow burial of dropper under film-free conditions, suitable seeding density screening and reasonable chemical regulation. ”
Currently, demonstration bases for non-film-free cotton have been established in Aksu, Kurle and Arar, producing 4,800 kilograms per hectare.
Cotton planted without film, to achieve abundant production, cost saving, environmental protection, comprehensive benefits to improve.
Zhang Donghai, an agronomist at the Agricultural Institute of the Third Division of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, said that through nearly six years of research and demonstration on the technology of non-membrane cotton, the production of non-membrane cotton can be achieved from 320 to 350 kilograms, possibly even higher.
“There is a great prospect for the promotion of non-membrane cotton cultivation technology. ”
Zhang Donghai believes that at present, non-membrane cotton cultivation technology can completely solve the problem of soil film pollution, but the economic benefits are still somewhat different than film cultivation.
“Cotton purchase price support will facilitate future promotion. ”
As a next step, he and his team will continue to carry out in-depth research on non-membrane cotton and expand its application on a large scale, and strengthen the industry, and solve the soil pollution problem caused by film.

According to IUCN, lions have been extinct in 26 African countries, and the total number of surviving wild lions has fallen by 43 percent over the past 20 years, leaving only about 20,000.
African lions are classified by this organization as a vulnerable animal.
Ganswintert said: “If we do not do something for this animal, they will face extinction. ”
He said that the new technology did not require lions to be reared, but only to inject sperm into a conceivable lioness, just as North America and Europe did for elephants in captivity.
South Korea's export decline in September was the largest in more than two years, but analysts attributed the decline to fewer working days, and said that despite rising trade tensions between China and the United States, global demand for South Korea goods is still strong.
Indeed, South Korea's average daily exports increased last month.
In addition, earlier preliminary data showed double-digit growth in exports in the first weeks of September before the long holiday.
South Korea's September export decline was the largest since July 2016, the decline was greater than the Reuters survey 11 analysts estimated a decline of 5.7 percent.
The initial value released on Monday showed that exports in September amounted to $50.6 billion, down from August 51.2 billion.
South Korea's exports to China increased 7.8 percent in September, for the 23rd consecutive month, despite concerns that the escalating trade dispute between the United States and China may cause other export-dependent Chinese neighbors to suffer as well.
South Korea's exports to the United States fell 11.8 percent, as sales of petroleum products fell.
Overseas sales of Korean memory chips and petroleum products increased by 28.3% and 13.5%, respectively, despite concerns that the so-called “supercycle” of chips may have seen the top.
“However, the impact of trade conflicts will be unavoidable, as South Korea's exports rely heavily on the US and China markets. ”
Imports fell 2.1% to $40.8 billion, less than the estimated growth of 3.1 percent in the Reuters survey.
The initial trade surplus in September was US $9.7 billion, up from US $6.9 billion in August.
The Ministry of Industry said that global manufacturing will continue to thrive thanks to the United States and EU countries, which is a good factor for Korean exports.
The statement pointed out, “the increase in oil prices caused by the increase in export prices, will also be beneficial to exports in the second half of this year. ”
“However, the continuation of the trade conflict between the United States and China, coupled with increased market volatility after the US rate hike, are negative pressures on exports. ”
Exports on average increased to $2.6 billion per working day in September, compared to $2.1 billion in August.
South Korea's Mid-Autumn Festival falls on September 24-26, so September only 19.5 working days, four days less than the same period last year.
South Korea exports in January-September grew 4.7% over the same period last year.
According to the Nikkei/Markit PMI, manufacturing activity in Korea rebounded in September, but backed by domestic orders as orders from China and Japan fell, threatening to overshadow export prospects.
North Korean media criticize the United States for not easing sanctions against North Korea
North Korea's “Labor Shimbun” published an op-ed article on September 30, criticizing the United States while seeking dialogue with North Korea while not relaxing sanctions against North Korea, calling it “contradictory”.
The article said that the US Secretary of State Pompeo said on the 14th that “the key to realizing the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is to implement sanctions against North Korea”, stressing that the US continues to implement the United Nations sanctions resolution position unchanged.
In the Singapore joint statement, both sides pledged to establish a new relationship between North Korea and the United States commensurate with the aspirations of the two peoples to peace and prosperity.
The United States, while increasing its sanctions to fight pressure, calls for dialogue, is undoubtedly contradictory.
The article says that if we want to establish new relations between North Korea and the United States, build a permanent consolidation of peace system in the Korean peninsula, and realize complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, we should put the building of trust in the first place, starting with what can be done, and solving it in stages one by one.
The article also said that the United States should understand that sanctions against North Korea will not work.
The article says, even before the “Kazan” number “North Devinsk” also let the US military admire.
“National Interest” magazine quoted the US Navy as saying: “We will meet strong potential opponents. Just look at the “North Devinsk” submarine. ”
Fogo, the current commander-in-chief of the US navy in Europe, also praised the “North Devinsk” submarine.
“The submarine is impressive,” he said. Looking at the development and use of the resources of the Russian Navy, the main efforts it has made in research and development are, first and foremost, strengthening the submarine fleet. ”
However, “National Interest” magazine still believes that the United States maintains an advantage over Russia in this area.
Fogo said: “I believe that Western countries still have asymmetric advantages. ”
Earlier it was reported that the Russian Navy will install the “Kazan” submarine in 2019.
The “Kazan”, “Novosibirsk”, “Krasnoyarsk” and “Arkhangelsk” multi-purpose submarines are “white wax tree-M” modified, with a displacement of 13800 tons, a depth of 520 meters, a staffing of 64 people, an underwater speed of 31 knots, torpedo and “caliber” and “onyx” cruise missiles.

This year, the State Administration of Radio and Television issued a notice to publicly stop advertisements such as “0 bubble milk”, “Sharapova cocktail” and “Bonrett plant loss hair dew” and other serious violations such as directional deviations and exaggerated propaganda and misleading audience.
The State Administration of Radio and Television has enacted a number of regulations and circulars to regulate the conduct of advertisements broadcast on radio and television.

Ignore the US threat!
EU may reach agreement with Iran on crude oil procurement
The US government announced a few days ago that it would restart a new round of sanctions against Iran in November and even urged other countries to reduce imports of Iranian oil.
However, the allies of the United States seem to have not heard.
According to the United States' New York Times report, on the 29th, Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif disclosed in an interview that despite the US threat to sanction any country doing business with Iran, Tehran is approaching an agreement with the EU on the sale of crude oil.
The core purpose of the agreement is to attempt to establish a new payment mechanism, i.e. barter or local currency, to replace dollar transactions.
The purpose of the method is to bypasse the United States and to prevent the United States from obstructing financial transfers.
At the same time, although the EU is working on the promotion of the agreement, some French and British officials are also worried. If the agreement is realized, it will be the most open confrontation between the EU and the US that opposes the US withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear agreement.
US media said that in an hour interview, Zarif's words sound more optimistic than in recent months.
Because the agreement is capable of “stripping” the traditional allies of the United States and effectively breaking down the US side's attempts to cut Iran's income.
“This will ensure that we sell oil and benefit,” Zarif believes that countries have the legitimate right to trade with Iran under the agreement reached in 2015.
The head of EU foreign policy, Fedelica Mogerini, also said before that, “No sovereign country or organization can accept other people to decide who they can trade with. ”
However, she also predicted that, before the United States Government embarked on the next sanctions in November, the United States leadership might adopt a series of financial instruments aimed at targeting banks, businessmen and countries that had business with Tehran.
In May this year, the United States Government unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear agreement on the grounds that the agreement was flawed and stated that it would not permanently ban Iran's production of nuclear fuel.
The United States then threatened to prohibit companies buying Iranian oil and other commodities from operating in the United States.
This threat led to the withdrawal of some companies from Tehran and the Iranian currency plunged.
Airbus and French oil giant Total have canceled billions of dollars of investment in Iraq.
British and French officials once said that the US government might “prevail”.
Otherwise, according to a recent Turkish media report, the US sanctions do not seem to have had a great impact on Iran's oil exports.
Iran's oil minister Zangane revealed a few days ago that no other country except South Korea stopped buying Iranian oil.
Zarif and Iranian President Rouhani both believe that the purpose of the US side's series of actions is to “tempt” Iran to violate the agreement.
Zarif also disdained about the series of verbal attacks by the United States. When asked whether the United States would overthrow the current Iranian government with increasing financial pressure, Zarif even laughed, “It is a tactic of regime change, which is the real purpose of the US side. ”

The reporter learned from the National Health and Health Commission that compared with decades ago, the incidence of malnutrition among children and adolescents in China has decreased, and the incidence of overweight obesity has increased significantly.
Experts pointed out in this regard that maintaining healthy weight, the most important concept is “cure the disease”, vigorously promote scientific fitness and reasonable diet.
According to the “Core Information and Interpretation of Health Education for Adolescents in China (2018 Edition)” released recently by the National Health and Health Commission, reasonable diet and scientific exercise are key to maintaining healthy weight.
Overweight, obesity and blind weight loss are detrimental to health.
The health risks behind the “chubby pier” should not be ignored.
Ding Gangqiang, director of the Nutrition and Health Institute of China Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said that overweight obesity endangers the normal growth and development of young people and has adverse effects on their psychology, behaviors, cognitive and intellectual abilities.
At the same time, overweight obesity tends to continue into adulthood, which increases the risk of chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes in adulthood.
Ding Gangqiang said that in 2010-2012, the nutritional and health status tests of Chinese residents showed that the rate of overweight among children aged 6-17 was 9.6 percent, and the obesity rate was 6.4 percent, and the two combined was 16 percent.
At the same time, overweight obesity among children and adolescents is characterized by a higher rate of overweight obesity among boys than girls and higher in urban areas than in rural areas. The rate of overweight obesity has risen markedly in recent decades.
How do teenagers cope with overweight obesity?
Zhang Li, deputy director of the Scientific Fitness and Health Promotion Research Center of the State Administration of Sports, pointed out that the main causes of obesity among adolescents are excessive calorie intake and insufficient physical activity.
For this simple obesity, emphasis should be placed on scientific exercise coupled with reasonable diet control.
Zhang Li pointed out that the most important concept of maintaining healthy weight is “no disease”. One of the most important aspects is to educate schools, parents and students on all aspects of universal science, to spread the dangers of overweight and obesity, and to raise awareness among young people about prevention.
Adolescents should be regularly examined to monitor growth and development indicators such as height and weight, and early detection and scientific assessment of overweight and obesity problems for timely intervention.
For youths who are already overweight and obese, Ding Gangqiang recommends that, in addition to actively organising meals and sports, young people are in a special physiological stage, avoid using hunger or semi-starvation therapy to control and reduce weight, and do not take weight loss medications blindly.

China News Agency, Yichang, October 1 (Guo Xiaoying and Liu Min) the newly revised “Three Gorges - Gezhouba water conservancy hub navigation dispatch protocol” (hereinafter referred to as “dispatching protocol”) began to be implemented on October 1, three Gorges ship lift in two years after the trial navigation, officially and the ship gate unified dispatch.
On the first day of implementation of the new regulations, the waters of the Three Gorges - Gezhouba are in good navigation order.
The Yangtze Three Gorges Navigation Authority issued its first security screening plan at 21.00 on September 30 and conducted security checks for 160 vessels. A total of 124 vessels were eligible.
At 1400 hours on 1 October, the Navigation Department arranged the first gates plan after the implementation of the new regulations.
After the implementation of the new regulations, the security screening plan will be released once a day at 9pm and 21pm, and the dam crossing plan will be released once a day at 14pm and 20pm each day, making it easy for ships to arrange the dam crossing plan flexibly.
The Dispatch Procedure adds the “classification control” principle of ship crossing the dam. The priority order of ships crossing the dam is defined according to the function positioning of the lock and lift, and the short-line passenger ship is adjusted to the same priority as the demonstration ship and the honesty ship.
This is also the second anniversary of the commissioning of the lift.
For the first time, the Chuanjiang River and Three Gorges reservoir models and new energy powered ships were also ranked as priority.
At the same time, the Dispatch Regulation adjusts the “navigational dispatch and management waters” from the previous 180 km near dam waters to 541.8 km of Yunyang Yangtze River Bridge to Shijuanjiang Bridge, and separates “core waters, near dam waters, control waters, and dispatching waters”.
This will help the ship to choose suitable water for the gate and reduce the backlog of vessels in the dam area.
According to the current characteristics of ships crossing the dam and waiting for gates, the “Dispatch Regulations” also put forward honesty measures such as the cancellation declaration of ships that violate violations, and the delay of 24 hours in crossing the dam.
After retaining water in the Three Gorges, navigation conditions in the reservoir area have been improved, facilitating the rapid development of Yangtze River shipping.
Data show that the annual cargo passage of the Three Gorges Ship and Gezhouba Ship Gate increased from 34.3 million tons in 2004 to 138 million tons and 140 million tons in 2017 respectively.
In the past two years, the Three Gorges ship lifts have passed 57,67 ships, 162,200 passengers and 1,712,800 tons of cargo.
Chen Dongyuan, deputy director of the Three Gorges Navigation Administration, said that the Dispatch Regulations have a positive effect on promoting honest gates management, maintaining the traffic order of the two dams hubs, defusing pressure on vessels waiting for gates in dam area, and enhancing navigational capacity.

With the approval of Premier Li Keqiang, the State Council recently issued the Decision on Further Reduction of the Inventory of Licensing Administration for Industrial Products and Simplifying the Approval Procedure.
The Decision proposes to further reduce the list of industrial product production license management, abolish the management of 14 types of industrial product production license, and delegate the authority to control the production license of four types of industrial products to the provincial people's government quality and technical supervision department.
After this reform, products that implement licensing management for industrial products will be reduced from 38 categories last year to 24 categories.
The Decision clearly introduces simplified approval procedures for products in the catalogue.
First, before the issuance of the certification authority organization of the product inspection is changed by the enterprise in the application to submit a qualified inspection inspection and inspection body issued the product inspection compliance report.
Second, in addition to hazardous chemicals, the quality and technical supervision department of the provincial people's government (market supervision and management department) implements a post on-site examination of the products, enterprises submit applications and product inspection compliance reports and make a commitment to ensure the quality and safety of the products, after the formal examination of the qualification can obtain the production license, and then accept the on-site inspection within the specified time.
Third, enterprises produce and operate in the catalog of different categories of products, in accordance with the principle of “one enterprise, one certificate”, when applying for a new license or applying for a license, together with the examination and issuance of a license.
The Decision requires all regions and relevant departments to work firmly on reducing the catalogue and simplifying the approval process.
Increase enterprise commitment publicity and post-site review efforts, strengthen credit supervision and restraint methods, implement enterprise quality principal responsibility, and revoke production licenses for false promises or non-compliant requirements.

Among them, China's manufacturing PMI was 50.8 percent, down 0.5 percent sequoM.
Zhao Qinghe said that the manufacturing PMI this month has five main features:
First, the fundamentals of manufacturing are generally stable.
Of the 21 industries surveyed, 14 industries PMI is located in the expansion zone, including pharmaceutical, special equipment, electrical machinery and other manufacturing PMI is at a high operating level of 53.5% and is growing faster.
The second is a slight fluctuation in supply and demand.
The Production Index and New Order Index were 53.0% and 52.0 percent, down 0.3 and 0.2 percent respectively from last month, while supply and demand continued to boom, but expansion slowed slightly.

Reuters Nagoya, November 5 - Bank of Japan President Higashihiko Kuroda said Monday that the central bank realized that long-term implementation of ultra-liberal monetary policy could squeeze the margin of financial institutions and could destabilize the country's banking system.
He said, however, that in view of sluggish inflation and uncertainty in overseas economies, the Bank of Japan needs to maintain its massive stimulus plan while paying close attention to the pros and cons of its policies.
“The Bank of Japan fully acknowledges that the strength of financial institutions will be increasingly affected under the continued monetary easing,” said Higashiko Kuroda in a speech to corporate leaders in Nagoya.
He said that if the financial institutions are more active in taking risks to compensate for the effects of low interest rates for many years, the banking system may be volatile once there is a serious negative impact.
“Although at present these risks are not big, the central bank will closely monitor the situation and encourage financial institutions to take the necessary measures,” he said.
The Bank of Japan meeting minutes released earlier Monday showed that at the September interest meeting, the Bank of Japan Policy Committee discussed the rising cost of long-term easing policy.
A member said that if the economy continues to expand, “the Bank of Japan has more flexibility in terms of policy in the future. ”
According to the minutes of the meeting, another member said that the Committee should discuss how long the Bank of Japan could maintain the stimulus policy, given its limitations over the duration of the policy.
Higashiko Kuroda said that the Bank of Japan will assess the financial risks associated with the easing policy, while also considering the uncertainty surrounding Japan's economic outlook, as Sino-US trade friction and rising protectionism may affect global demand.
“The impact of such problems on the Japanese economy is limited for the time being,” said Higashiko Kuroda.
“But how the problem persists, the impact on the Japanese economy may become bigger,” he added.
“There is a need for strong monetary easing on a sustained basis, while considering both positive and negative impacts in a balanced manner,” said Higashiko Kuroda.
Despite the increased downside of the radical stimulus plan, such as long-term low interest rates eroding financial institutions' profitability, sluggish inflation forced the Bank of Japan to maintain the plan.
The Bank of Japan maintained its monetary policy last month; in the face of the risks posed by the end of the global trade war, Higashiko Kuroda ruled out the possibility of a recent rate hike.
June 1, 2018, Cardiff, USA, corporate logo on Tesla electric vehicle.
Under a settlement agreement, Tesla Motors and its CEO Musk have agreed to pay $20 million in fines to financial regulators, and Musk will resign as chairman of the company but remain CEO.
The settlement agreement will put an end to two months of turmoil for Tesla.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) disclosed on Saturday the settlement agreement on securities fraud charges will make investors feel comfortable.
Investors had feared that the protracted legal dispute would only further blow the still losing EV company.
SEC sued Musk fraud on Thursday, calling its August 7 tweets misleading investors.
Tweets said he was considering privatization of Tesla at $420 per share and had received financing.
SEC said the tweets were actually unfounded and the market turmoil it caused hurt investors.
Investors and corporate governance experts said the agreement could reinforce Tesla, hard-hit by Musk's recent actions.
Steven Heim, head of Boston Common Asset Management, said the settlement agreement should result in more scrutiny of Musk, without taking “devastating” measures to drive him out of Tesla.
The asset management company holds Tesla's battery manufacturer Panasonic shares.
Under the proposed agreement, Tesla was required to appoint an independent chairman, two independent directors and a board committee to develop controls on external communications in Musk.
“It is in the best interests of our market and our investors, including Tesla shareholders, that this matter be resolved quickly on agreed terms,” said SEC Chairman Clayton in a statement.
Thursday's charges led to Tesla's market capitalization evaporation of about $7 billion, the company's market capitalization on Friday was 45.2 billion, down from General Motors 47.5 billion.
In the settlement agreement, SEC withdrew its demand to remove Musk from the head of the company.
Many investors claim that this penalty will be disastrous.
“I think this is the best possible outcome for all concerned,” said Ivan Feinseth of Tiger Financial Partners. Feinseth gave Tesla a “neutral” rating and said that SEC's punishment was “light punishment” for Musk.
“It is important for Tesla that he remains CEO. ”
Neither Musk nor Tesla conceded or denied the allegations of SEC in the settlement agreement, nor did they immediately respond to requests for comment.
Settlement agreements are still subject to court approval.

General Secretary Xi Jinping delivered a very important speech at the private enterprise symposium, instilling firm confidence in the private economy towards a wider stage.
General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed that “let entrepreneurs take off the burden of thinking and move forward lightly” triggered strong resonance among entrepreneurs and innovative entrepreneurs.
Market dynamism comes from people, especially from entrepreneurs, from entrepreneurship.
In the 40 years of reform and opening-up, there are tens of millions of entrepreneurs and innovation stories. Entrepreneurs grow and grow, constantly pushing China's economy forward.
For some time now, some people in society have made statements that negate and doubt the private economy.
Mistaken statements such as the so-called “private economic exit theory” and “new public-private partnership theory” have raised doubts and concerns among some entrepreneurs.
Recently, some private enterprises have encountered many difficulties and problems in operating development.
For example, changes in the international economic environment have had an impact on some exporting firms; rapid restructuring of demand has led to transformational upgrading pressures; some policies are inconsistent, policy effects are overlapping, or simple ways of working, leading to the opposite effect of policies designed to be good.
Various factors are intertwined, the private economy is experiencing difficulties, some private enterprises face difficulties in operating, and entrepreneurs show a lot of anxiety.
In this context, correcting misconceptions in perception, removing the burden of ideas on entrepreneurs, allowing enterprises to pursue development with one heart and the government to promote development with one heart. It is of particular relevance to market confidence and development expectations.
This symposium again emphasized the important argument of “three have not changed”: “The status and role of non-public economy in China's economic and social development have not changed!”
From deepening the decentralization and decentralization of power, establishing a power list system to creating a legal environment that protects the legitimate rights and interests of entrepreneurs, creating a fair playing market environment, and shaping an atmosphere of respect for entrepreneurs in society. In recent years, the Party Central Committee has placed unprecedented emphasis on entrepreneurs and the degree of institutional protection.
The symposium also clearly proposed policy initiatives to strongly support private enterprises in six areas, and launched a series of practical actions dedicated to “light wear forward” for private enterprises.
These are a great encouragement to the entrepreneurial community and more expectations from all walks of life.
The fog is set aside and the policy is set. The key is to implement it.
We should constantly create a better development environment for the private economy, help private enterprises solve difficulties in development, help them realize China's economic transformation and upgrade; let entrepreneurs feel fair in market competition, feel safe in legitimate business, feel respect in social life, and stimulate innovation vitality and creative potential.
China's economy is moving towards high-quality development, which requires more entrepreneurs to realize their ambitions, and also provides a greater space and stage for entrepreneurs to develop their creativity.
We have reason to believe that, with further deepening reforms and removing obstacles, the private economy will usher in a better development prospect and opportunities and move on to a wider arena.

National Flag Raising Ceremony to Celebrate National Day at the Estuary Crossing Point of the Sino-Vietnamese Border
“I never thought there was such a majestic and spectacular flag raising ceremony in the border, which was even more impressive than watching the flag raising in the Mainland. ”
On the morning of the 1st, Mr. Zhang, who traveled from Sichuan to the Yunnan River Port of the Sino-Vietnamese border, and more than 500 army officers and soldiers, residents, and Chinese and foreign tourists jointly watched the national flag raising ceremony, celebrating the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
The Estuary is the largest port of the Yunnan section of the Sino-Vietnamese border. It is located in Hesou County, Honghezhou, Yunnan Province.
With the deepening of the development of the “Belt and Road”, as one of China's most convenient links to Southeast Asia, the flow of incoming and outgoing traffic at the Estuary ports has steadily increased.
At 7:30 a.m., the sun just revealed a corner. The limited area of the river port gathered early in the morning, local people and Chinese and foreign tourists who came to watch the flag raising ceremony.
At 7:45, the flag-raising ceremony began on time. The National Gate Guard of Honour at the Kawaguchi Border Control Station shook his mind and took a step of health to escort the national flag to the raising platform.
After the commander issued the flag raising order, the flagman struggled to draw an arc. The bright five-star red flag, like the “eagle wings”, slowly raised with the thrilling and majestic melody of the national anthem.
“The National Day Flag Raising Ceremony, such as New Year's Day, Spring Festival, and National Day, not only shows the image of China, but also inspires patriotic feelings among the people of all ethnic groups in the border. ”
The officers and soldiers of the honor guard who attended the flag-raising ceremony said.
It is reported that the National Gate Honour Guard in charge of the Estuary port flag raising ceremony consists of more than 40 officers and soldiers from each post at the Estuary border checkpoint, from 3 people to a scale of honor guard, this team has experienced more than 60 years of history, since its establishment has carried out more than 70 national foreign affairs mission missions.
The newly revised Personal Income Tax Law adjusts the standard for PRC resident taxpayers from a full year to 183 days.
Relevant officials from China's Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation said on the 30th that in order to maintain policy stability, the next step in implementing the new Personal Income Tax Law will consider continuing to make concessionary arrangements for overseas people, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
The person in charge said that the current regulations on the implementation of the Personal Income Tax Law have special preferential provisions on the taxation of persons outside China. Individuals who have no residence in China but have resided for more than one year or five years, whose income originates outside China can only pay personal income tax on the part paid by units or individuals in China.
Payments made abroad are not subject to personal income tax in China.
China's Ministry of Finance, the State Administration of Taxation, the State Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Commerce also issued a circular to expand the scope of application of the policy of withholding income tax for direct investment by distributing profits.
The scope of application of the policy of withholding income tax on domestic direct investment is extended from foreign investment incentives to all non-prohibited foreign investment projects and areas.
During the 73rd United Nations General Assembly, some positive messages were released around the Korean peninsula.
South Korean President Won Jae-in conveyed North Korea's “irreversible” rejection of nuclear, and said that US President Trump and North Korea's top leader Kim Jong-un may meet before the end of this year.
The US State Department later said that Secretary of State Pompeo would visit North Korea in October to promote the implementation of the Singapore meeting commitment of US North Korea leaders.
From the beginning of this year to the present day, North and South Korea broke the ice and opened the path of dialogue. North Korea and South Korea, North Korea and the United States met. The general trend of easing the situation on the peninsula continued, and the principle of dialogue to resolve the peninsula issue was upheld.
First, the point that “the essence of the issue of the peninsula is a security issue” has not changed. The key to achieving peace on the peninsula is a proper and balanced solution of the legitimate security concerns of all parties, rather than exerting pressure on each other and emphasizing their own demands.
Secondly, in the dialogue on the realization of the denuclearization of the peninsula, the parties concerned continue to disagree on the steps and means of realizing the denuclearization of the peninsula. Due to the long-term lack of political trust between North Korea and the United States, the game thinking of “who comes first and after” is still strong.
At the Security Council's open meeting on the Korean Peninsula issue held at the United Nations Headquarters in New York a few days ago, the different voices raised around the issue of sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea again highlighted the fact that these two points “have not changed” on the issue of the peninsula.
US Secretary of State Pompeo insists that sanctions against North Korea will not be lifted until the complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
On the other hand, Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov stressed the principle of “responding to action by action”, pointing out: “The weakening trend of sanctions should be at the same pace as North Korea has taken on the path of gradual abandonment of nuclear.”
There is no doubt that the parties concerned should continue to fully, completely and accurately implement Security Council resolutions related to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, but pressure is not an end. The implementation of sanctions and the promotion of a political settlement are all requirements of Security Council resolutions.
As China's State Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, in view of the current positive developments in relations between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the United States, China believes that it is necessary for the Security Council to consider initiating reversible clauses in due course, thereby encouraging the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the parties concerned to take even greater steps towards denuclearization.
Looking back, the denuclearization of the peninsula and every progress in the peace process required sufficient political courage on the part of the parties.
At present, in the face of the growing expectations of the international community to promote a political solution to the issue of the peninsula, all parties concerned should demonstrate political vigor, make political decisions, implement their commitments, resolve difficult problems, and continue to make parallel strides, advance the process of denuclearization of the peninsula and establish a peace mechanism on the peninsula in order to jointly create a permanent peace on the peninsula.

Reuters TOKYO, October 1 - The Bank of Japan released a short survey quarterly report on Monday showed that the confidence of major Japanese manufacturers in September hit the lowest level in more than a year, due to rising raw material costs and a series of natural disasters affecting production, making companies feel the pressure.
The survey hardly shows that the escalating global trade friction has hit the confidence of large manufacturers.
But the risk of a full-fledged trade war hits business prospects and may threaten capital expenditure.
Active capital spending is a highlight of the Japanese economy.
The survey calls into question the Bank of Japan's view that a robust economic expansion will help accelerate inflation to the 2% target, although there are indications that companies are gradually shifting costs to customers.
“In the context of the global trade war, manufacturers' confidence is stagnant due to the slowdown in exports and weak factory production,” said Nan Wuzhi, chief researcher at the Institute of Agriculture and Forestry.
“Confidence is still high. And as corporate profitability is improving and prices rise, I don't think confidence will continue to decline. ”
Short survey shows that in September large manufacturing boom judgment index fell from positive 21 three months ago to positive 19, for the third consecutive quarter deterioration.
The median estimated market value is positive 22.
In September, large non-manufacturing industry boom judgment index dropped from positive 24 in June to positive 22, for the first time in eight quarters.
Reuters survey is positive 22.
Survey shows that in December large manufacturing and non-manufacturing sector outlook index is expected to remain unchanged.
The Nikkei index rose to 27-year high on Monday, as the Japanese yen continued devaluation helped improve the export profitability prospects of Japanese companies.
Capital expenditure is robust.
Despite a decline in corporate confidence, the latest shortcut highlights a robust capital spending plan, thanks to renewed capacity and increased investment in robotics and automation to cope with labour shortages caused by an ageing population.
The central bank short survey shows that large companies plan to increase their capital spending by 13.4% for the fiscal year ending March 2019.
It was 13.6 per cent at the time of the previous short-sighted survey.
Nashiki said that all corporate capital spending plans to grow 8.5 percent this fiscal year, close to the pace of the bubble economy in Japan.
“There is room for further growth in capital spending as small businesses raise their profitability forecasts from now on, but this depends largely on the impact of trade wars on business confidence,” he said. ”
Short-sighted surveys show that firms have increased their ability to transfer costs, with large firms output price indices of positive 7, a 10-year high, which is encouraging signs that Japan has made progress in its efforts to combat deflation.
The index measuring the employment status of large enterprises hit a negative 23, the most critical level since 1992, highlighting the tightening of the job market.
The Japanese economy rebounded in the second quarter from the contraction in January-March of this year, benefiting from strong corporate spending.
However, during the summer, trade friction escalated and the supply chain was disrupted by natural disasters, overshadowing the outlook for Japan's export-dependent economy.

The president of the International Astronautical Federation, Jean-Yves Le Gall, delivered a speech at the opening ceremony, said that the global space industry is no longer only a few countries and institutions involved. The number of participants this year has increased significantly over the previous session, indicating that more and more institutions and people are joining it.
He called on all countries to strengthen cooperation and innovation and jointly promote the development of space industry.
Zhang Kejian, vice-minister of China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and director of the State Space Administration, introduced China's space program while attending the exchange activities, and said that China will expand international cooperation in the field of space and contribute to the human space cause.
Representatives of China Aerospace Science and Technology Group Corporation, China Aerospace Science and Technology Group Corporation and some private enterprises attended the meeting, showcasing the latest achievements of China's aerospace, including launch vehicles, satellites and aerospace science and technology applications products.

Reuters Beijing, November 5 - China Foreign Trade Center on Sunday said the Canton Fair showed that China's foreign trade situation is still complex and serious, with 80.6% of enterprises expected to export better in 2018 than last year or flat.
However, given the continuous rise in the cost of domestic raw materials and labor, and the increasing impact of Sino-US trade friction, the exhibitors also believe that the export situation next year is not optimistic.
At the closing press conference of the 124th Canton Fair, Xu Bing, deputy secretary general of the Canton Fair, a press spokesman and deputy director of the China Foreign Trade Center, said that the number of foreign buyers attending the current Canton Fair and the number of export transactions fell slightly compared to the same period.
This session of buyers attended 189,812 people from 215 countries and regions, down 1.11% year-on-year.
Export turnover RMB 26,494 million (US $29.86 billion), down 1 percent year-on-year.
From the market perspective, deals for Japan, ASEAN 10, BRICS and South Korea rose 74.4 percent, 11.4 percent, 7.2 percent, 2.5 percent, and traditional markets such as the United States, Australia, Canada and the European Union declined by 30.3 percent, 8.9 percent, 7.3 percent, 0.8 percent.
In terms of the industry, transportation, machinery and equipment, building and decoration materials, consumer electronics and information products, and sanitary equipment increased by 24.8%, 21.1%, 20.0%, 15.1%, and 7.6 percent respectively, textile clothing and household appliances decreased by 13. 0 and 6.7% respectively.
Xu Bing said that as a barometer and wind vane for China's foreign trade, the situation of buyers at this Canton Fair and export transaction data show that China's foreign trade development will still face many uncertain and unstable factors next year.
However, with the deepening of supply-side structural reforms and the recent introduction of “six stable” policy measures at the national and local levels, China's new dynamic of foreign trade development is accelerating accumulation, and the diversification of the enterprise market continues to make new progress. These are the important foundation and strong conditions for foreign trade development.
“Combined with all factors, it is expected that China's foreign trade imports and exports will continue to grow steadily throughout the year, with further improvement in quality and efficiency. Xu Bing said.
China Customs Administration announced that exports in dollar terms rose 14.5% yoy in September, imports rose 14.3% yoy, September trade surplus was 31.69 billion dollars, September export growth and trade surplus are the highest since February this year.
Despite the escalating trade friction between China and the United States, China's export performance in September was still significantly higher than expected, with strong external demand, companies grabbing export overlay before US tariffs, or major supporting factors, also showing the resilience of China's foreign trade to some extent, but the blow to confidence and the impact on the industrial chain cannot be underestimated. Analysts believe that China's foreign trade challenges may appear in the fourth quarter or next year.
Reuters survey showed that the US fund manager proposed to increase cash holdings in September, continue to maintain a cautious position, as the US and China began the latest round of mutual import tariffs, and the dispute showed no signs of easing.
However, according to 12 fund managers who participated in the survey, North America's asset allocation increased to the highest since June 2017, while positions in the UK, the eurozone, and especially emerging markets declined.
Global equity allocation averaged 56.6 per cent and bonds 35.5 per cent, largely consistent with last month's survey.
The most notable change was that the cash-matching ratio rose to 5.1 per cent, the highest since December 2014.
A fund manager of a large fund company said, “Some economic data bring confidence to the market, but the trade war is still the biggest concern, so it's better to be ready to enter when the market falls. ”
But fund managers in September still prefer stocks, especially US stocks, even though US stocks are considered high prices.
Today, in China's open landmark Shanghai, the world's first large-scale national exhibition with the theme of import, China International Import Expo, officially kicked off in anticipation.
An exhibition is like a window that gives the world a better understanding of a city and a country.
Through the “window” of the Expo, people see moving towards a higher level of “open China”. With the help of the “window” of the Expo, the world is welcome to win-win and win-win between China and the “reform and opening-up”.
“For a country, opening is like a cocoon into a butterfly, which will experience a moment of pain, but in exchange for a new life. ”
General Secretary Xi Jinping's summary of the open road points out an important reason why China can.
Looking back over the 40 years of reform and opening-up, China, which dares to enter the world market, has encountered whirlpool and waves, but has always faced all risks and challenges with an open attitude, unleashing endogenous momentum and continuously improving competitiveness.
It can be said that with its own real achievements, China has strongly interpreted the value and significance of openness.
Stating on a new historical starting point, holding an exposition with the theme of imports is a major decision made by the Party Central Committee with the focus of Comrade Xi Jinping at the core to promote a new high level of opening-up. It is a major step for China to open its markets to the world. It is China's practical action to support economic globalization and trade liberalization..
And the high number of exhibitors from various countries and the “one hard to find” booth is the biggest affirmation and best response to China's development of an open economy in a wider, wider and deeper field.
More importantly, the current global economic and trade order has reached a crossroads.
Some countries have erected high walls of trade protectionism and reversed to unilateralism, raising the concerns of the international community about the prospects for free trade and adding many uncertainties to the warmed world economy.
Against such an era, the event on the banks of the Huangpu River embodies China's defence of free trade, allowing the world to see open markets and share the future of China's confidence and responsibility.
Go alone fast, go far.
China's open mind and embrace the world has not only greatly promoted its own development, but also brought a surging “China opportunity” to all countries and regions.
In recent years, China has advocated and promoted the establishment of the Belt and Road Initiative, initiated the establishment of the Asian Investment Bank, set up the Silk Road Fund... China has provided a range of international public goods, provided a real export market, development opportunities and employment opportunities, allowing enterprises from various countries to take advantage of China's development “Express” and “Hitchhike”.
The Expo is also such a public goods and a large platform for global economic and trade cooperation.
On this platform, more than 3,000 companies from 130 countries and regions have taken a new step in the Chinese market with their distinctive quality products and services.
In addition to national enterprises, domestic consumers are also benefiting.
By building this platform, we provide multi-channel high-quality supply for consumer upgrade, meet the personalized, diversified and differentiated consumption needs of the people.
With the opening doors of China getting bigger and bigger, the flow of goods and their use, the steps towards a better life will be more solid.
From a more macro point of view, the significance of the Expo has gone beyond the realm of economy and trade, but rather to the future, conveying the concepts of openness, inclusiveness, inclusive, balanced and win-win, and forming a common understanding to tackle today's challenges.
The world is better, China can be better; China is better, the world is better.
We look forward to the exciting and successful world at the Expo. We look forward to moving towards a higher level of “Open China” and the world to build a bright future for the common destiny of mankind.
Foreign media: The United States and Canada reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
[Abstract] The agreement includes the opening of Canada's dairy market to the United States and the temporary suspension of tariffs on cars produced in Canada.
According to foreign media reports, a Canadian source local time on the evening of September 30 revealed that the United States and Canada have reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
According to the agreement, Canada opened its dairy market to the United States and the United States temporarily suspended tariffs on cars produced in Canada.
Last month, the United States and Mexico announced a preliminary agreement in principle on updating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), but the United States and Canada failed to reach an agreement on the 31 August deadline set by the United States to extend the negotiations until 30 September.
Earlier, Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland's spokesman said that Canada would only sign favorable agreements, “focus on substance, not timetable. We will continue our consultations in the hope of reaching an agreement that is in the national interest of Canada. ”
Over 90% of Brazilian women voters say presidential candidates do not take women's needs into account.
According to the South American newspaper, data released recently by the Brazilian National Geographic Institute (IBGE) show that more than 90% of Brazilian women do not think presidential candidates take women's needs into account.
According to the report, the number of women in Brazil has reached 107 million, and if women from all Brazil are brought together to form a country, the country's population will be ranked 13th in the world, twice as many as Spain's population.
In Brazil, women account for 52 per cent of the total voter population and men for 48 per cent, and although the proportion of women in the electorate is very high, only 10 per cent of the Brazilian Congress is women.
In 193 countries around the world, Brazilian women's participation in politics ranked only 154th, higher than Arab countries.
After more than 20 years of struggle for rights, Brazilian women are still not successful in acquiring their rights.
Brazilian sociologist Natalia Mori points out that this phenomenon exists because of the combined effects of ancient patriarchal society, racism and capitalist values.
“Politics should have been made up of national democracy, citizenship, identity, access to public goods and the formation of one society by multiple social groups. But politics in Brazil is a monopoly of one group and the majority of the population is not represented. ”
A previous study by the Brazilian Locomotiva also noted that 94 per cent of Brazilian women did not feel that elected politicians were able to represent their rights, 90 per cent did not agree with the decisions made by politicians, and 93 per cent did not agree with the current government policy.
“We need to reverse the under-representation of women in Parliament, and Brazil's political system is still affected by inequality. To date, there are still serious gender, class and racial discrimination in the political arena in Brazil. Natalia Mori said.
Despite the lack of women's rights, most Brazilian women still believe in the power of democracy.
The survey showed that 76 per cent of women thought they could make a difference in democratic elections and 72 per cent were interested in politics.
In addition, 55 per cent of women believe that democratic politics is the best way to expose women to less prejudice.

Guangxi Guilin Liangjiang International Airport Terminal T2 was officially opened on the 30th.
Zhao Leqin, secretary of the CPC Guilin Municipal Committee, said that the new terminal will meet the demand for 12 million passengers a year, building a new advantage for air traffic in Guilin, which will be of great significance to further improve the modern three-dimensional traffic pattern of Guangxi River and Sea Link, Sea Railway Transport, Land and Sea Transport, and Airports.
Guilin is expected to receive more than 90 million visitors this year.
The expansion of the T2 terminal and the supporting facilities at Guilin Liangjiang International Airport is a major public welfare project for the 60th anniversary of the founding of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. It is also a landmark project for the construction of Guilin International Tourist Attraction.
The project started in December 2015, with a gross floor area of 100,000 square meters, with a total investment of 3,258 million yuan, will meet the annual demand for passenger throughput of 12 million passengers, 10.12 million movements and 95,000 tons of cargo mail throughput.
On that day, more than 200 flights took off and landed at Terminal T2 at Guilin Liangjiang International Airport.
The design of the new terminal building is inspired by the landscape of Guilin, looking like a “landscape crown”, approximating the scenery of “dragon ridge terraces” and the roofs of Guibei residential residence.
According to the introduction, the new terminal of Guilin Airport can meet the peak traffic of nearly 4,000 people per hour. It has applied intelligent luggage sorting system, security integration platform, face recognition and other technology means of “smart airport”, planning business districts covering various industries such as catering, department stores, duty-free and entertainment.
As growth in Europe, Asia and emerging markets has been largely unencouraging, the United States is increasingly the main engine of global economic growth.
September 23, 2018, New Jersey, USA, a container ship docked in the port.
But the current growth in the United States has benefited from the time of fiscal stimulus for tax cuts, so the country's economy has also been closely watched by the outside world.
“As the United States is returning to full employment, the economic downturn is inevitable. ”
He said that the only question is when will happen, in his opinion, may only be ahead and not later.
Although Barclays is optimistic about the US economic outlook before the end of this year, the bank admitted that it is more difficult to forecast further.
“In the absence of more sustainable investment growth to boost economic growth, current fiscal policy-driven growth will be unsustainable,” Barclays economist said in a study.
“At a time of lack of investment growth, the risk of a hard landing for the economy in 2020 will rise,” they said.
A series of business surveys will generally indicate that the major economies are in the cycle stage at the end of the third quarter.
The Eurozone and US manufacturing survey, scheduled to be released next Monday, will be followed by a service survey on Wednesday.
But the focus of next week's data will inevitably be the US non-farm payrolls data to be released next Friday, the data will provide a clue whether the tight job market is driving significant salary growth.
Not only is it important for business profitability and consumer purchasing power, but also because salary jumps or triggers an overall inflation rise, which may cause the Federal Reserve Commission (Fed) officials to be uncomfortable.
“Pay will be a lot of attention, as it may rise sharply again from the previous month.
September over the same period of the previous year may not rise above 3%, but we can fully expect a breakthrough next month,” the Dutch International Group (ING) economist wrote in a research report.
As holidays in China and other parts of Asia lead to light data in the region next week, the European political situation may be a source of market volatility.
The Italian government ignores its previous financial commitments to the EU, and the other EU member States will have to quickly determine whether to firmly oppose this decision. Tria did not support the decision and he hoped to comply with the EU rules.
As Britain retreat negotiations enter a critical stage, the British Conservative Party's annual meeting in Birmingham may also be sparkling.
At the same time, fears around emerging markets are unlikely to weaken as Brazil will hold the much-anticipated presidential elections next weekend.
[Abstract] When completed, the ship will be delivered to the East China Sea Branch of the State Oceanic Administration of China. Chen Zhi, Director of the Observation Office of the Marine Early Warning and Monitoring Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China, said that the ship will be of great significance for the development of China offshore ocean observation system and the promotion of global ocean observation.
On September 29, China's first 3000 ton large buoy ship, “Xiangyang Hong2", was launched into the water of the Chinese Martial Ship Group.
When the ship is completed, it will break the bottleneck of China's equipment in the maintenance work of large buoys, submarines, recycling, and emergency repair.
The “Xiangyang Red 22” wheel is mainly used for regular patrol maintenance, regular distribution and recovery of buoyan/submarine buoyan/submarine buyan/submarine emergency distribution, recovery and emergency repair, and has the ability to carry out comprehensive marine investigation tasks such as sectional investigation.
The new ship is 89 meters long, 18 meters wide, 7.2 meters deep and 10,000 nautical miles endurance.
Wang Weiling, Deputy General Manager of Washa Group, said: “The Xiang Yanghong 22 is the first large buoy operation ship in China and the only one in China with the ability to lift 10 meters of large buoy, which will further enhance China's large buoy guarantee capability. ”
It is understood that when the ship is completed, it will be delivered to the East China Sea Branch of the State Oceanic Administration of China. Chen Zhi, director of the Observation Office of the Marine Early Warning and Monitoring Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China, said that the ship will be of great significance for the development of China's offshore ocean observation system and the promotion of global ocean observation.
“This ship has both large buoy placement and maintenance operations and integrated marine investigation capability. It is the first comprehensive ship dedicated to COSCO sea buoy operations and marine integrated survey.
With such buoy ships, we have a powerful tool for ocean observation and ocean survey in the future. ”
Beijing, Qingdao, October 1 (Reuters) affected by typhoon “tan beauty”, scheduled to start on September 30 2018 international extreme sailing series Qingdao station “mazerun cup” will be the first race day postponed to October 1, and in Qingdao Olympic Sailing Center before the race meeting, 12 winged catamaran captain appeared all the appearance.
Influenced by the typhoon “Tan Mei” ring, the harbor pond strong winds, the maximum wind speed is even as high as 24 knots, the sail signal from the 30th 1 pm postponed nearly 90 minutes, the wind speed is still not reduced, the event president ordered Anne Mderlant announced the cancellation of the first day of the game, postponed to October 1 afternoon.
“Strong winds blowing from the shore continue, and the sea conditions are too intense. ”
Mderlant explained: “In such a situation, no one knows when and when the gust of wind scraped towards the boat.
Close to the city's arena, cancellation is the most sensible option in terms of the current climate. ”
The crew of all ready is still somewhat disappointed.
“The boat is ready to stop, and we are in good shape. ”
Qingdao team's helm Max Richardson admitted: “But I know the match rescheduling is the right choice, and I hope today wind energy is smaller, we can go. ”
Known as the “Star of Hope” of New Zealand at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, Omeka Wilkinson said: “Loss of one day makes the game more interesting.
Because today's match will increase, and there are only two days left.
Everyone will be particularly desperate. ”
Despite the fierce sea breeze, Pierre Yves Durrant, the helm of the French ABM team, in a meeting before the race, appealed his warmth with Qingdao, where the competition took place: five years ago, the International Extreme Sailing Series was injured, muscle rupture, and thanks to the treatment of the local medical team, he was able to stand on the venue five years later today.
It is reported that the International Extreme Sailing Series was founded in 2007 and is the same as the Volvo, America's Cup, the World Sailing Tournament and other events.
The Qingdao race will use “flying ghost” hydrofoil catamaran (FlyingPhantom).
2018 is the eighth year of the event landing in Qingdao, the capital of sailing, and Qingdao Station is also the end of the series.
Despite the continued volatility in global financial markets, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said on Monday that the investment income of the Exchange Fund in the third quarter of this year fell 97% year-on-year but was better than the previous quarter, as overseas stocks rose high and foreign exchange losses narrowed significantly after the Sino-US trade war.
According to the latest data from the HKMA, the Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK $1.6 billion in July-September 2018, significantly lower than HK $61.8 billion in the same period last year, but better than the revised HK $100 million in the second quarter of this year.
At the beginning of the Sino-US trade war, Hong Kong and emerging markets indexes ran counter to US stock indexes. Until the end of September and early October, the US stock market sentiment began to reverse, as investors became aware that the trade war was detrimental to the US itself.
“Changing market sentiment is good, and if a trade war has only unilateral effects, it will not help to solve things. ”
But at the same time, he pointed out, “If the Sino-US trade war is not resolved, the financial market volatility will continue to rise. ”
In the third quarter of this year, the Exchange Fund's equity investment losses in Hong Kong narrowed by 8% to HK $4.7 billion, while overseas equity investment income increased by 172% to HK $12.8 billion. Foreign exchange losses of HK $16.2 billion and bond yields of HK $9.7 billion decreased by 24% and 31 percent respectively, reflecting the general increase in the dollar against major currencies during the quarter and the US yield of 3% in mid-September.
The Exchange Fund is mainly used to support Hong Kong dollars.
Hong Kong has a linked exchange rate system pegged to the United States dollar since 1983.
Regarding Hong Kong's current financial situation, Chen Tellin said that economic and asset market uncertainty had increased and downside risks had increased. However, Hong Kong's financial system was robust, well defended, and its seismic capacity was abundant.
“Hong Kong has an abundant international investment position, with an external net asset value of $1.4 trillion equivalent to four times GDP, 2.5 times higher than Singapore and 0.6 times higher than Japan, and more than enough to cope with downside cycles or reversals. ”
The HKD rate continued to decline and spread on the US dollar. Mr Chan pointed out that the HKD rate had risen more than 400 basis points on 21 September. The market is generally believed to be mainly related to the HKD rate rise. Since then, the HKD hovers around 7.80-7.84, the HKD rate has continued to decline and the spread of the US dollar may attract the market to sell HKD and buy USD.The chances of triggering a weaker party guarantee again are greater than in the previous period.
But he thinks, as Hong Kong banks raise interest rate cycle begins, Hong Kong dollar interest rate normalization underway, future Hong Kong dollar interest rate is lower than US dollar interest rate situation will change.
“The Hong Kong dollar rate and the dollar rate trend will be more consistent. We must be more careful to manage risks and prepare for market fluctuations. ”
Due to the abundance of funds in Hong Kong dollars, HKD rates fell further, with the three-month rates falling 0.9% to 2.08179 percent on Monday, widening the margin with the US dollar from 46 basis points to 51 basis points, while the one-month rate reached a five-month low with the US dollar spreads expanded from 120 basis points to 127 basis points.
From May to mid-September, the spot exchange rate of Hong Kong dollar approached 7.85 to US $1 for most of the time.
During the period, the weaker party bond was triggered several times in May and August following the first triggering in April due to the outflow of some of the funds from the IPO after the completion of the colloquia event and the large prospectus.
HKMA buys Hong Kong dollars and sits US dollars at 7.85 levels in accordance with the linked exchange rate system to maintain a stable exchange rate of Hong Kong dollars.
The HKMA bought about HK $52.1 billion in May and August under the Weak-side Exchange Guarantee.
Does the new tax code offer benefits to overseas people?
Relevant officials from the Ministry of Finance and the General Administration of Taxation said on the 30th that in order to maintain policy stability, in implementing the new personal income tax law, they will consider continuing to make concessionary arrangements for overseas people, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
Some reporters asked that the newly revised personal income tax law will adjust the criteria for determining the resident taxpayers of our country's personal income tax from a full year to a full 183 days.
Will there be any preferential arrangements for overseas persons, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, in the next step of the implementation of the Act?
In response, the person in charge said that the current regulations on the implementation of the Personal Income Tax Law have special preferential provisions on the taxation of persons outside China. Individuals who have no residence in China but have resided for more than one year or five years can only pay personal income tax on the part paid by units or individuals in China.
The person in charge said that in order to maintain policy stability, the next step in implementing the new Personal Income Tax Law will consider continuing to make concessionary arrangements for overseas people, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
No “threshold” of the month center: quality certification promotes quality improvement.
With the “two-child economy” pulled by the prosperity of the mother and child market, from the north to the third and fourth tier cities, there have been various grades of confiner clubs in various places.
The current very hot month club has met the consumer needs of the people. The fees range from tens of thousands of yuan to hundreds of thousands of yuan, but at the same time it is in an awkward position. The institution has so far no threshold, and there is still a blank space for supervision.
The State Administration of Market Supervision recently launched the 2018 national “Quality Month” series of activities, reporters visited a five-star confiner center in Tianjin to visit mother-child care service certification experience.
The general confinement center provides services such as neonatal care, nutritional meals and postpartum prostheses.
In this confinement center, the reporter saw that nurses daily check newborns breastfeeding, professional nurses provide fine care services for newborns such as bathing, stroking and other.
At the same time, to meet the needs of new mothers, we offer Chinese medicine treatments and beauty treatments, from early wound care to mid- and late months beauty care to help moms recover their slim posture.
A new mother in residence told reporters that she made an appointment to this month club eight months in advance.
The services of the monthly club directly affect the comfort of the mother during the month and physical recovery, some small monthly club can only provide some simple monthly services, there are disinfection and hygiene irregularities, easy to cross infection, diet unscientific and other problems hidden.
The director of this connauge center said they are the only one of the five star connauzi centers in Tianjin that has been certified as B service.
“Although some customers did not understand the meaning of Class B certification at first, it is important to the long-term development of the company by compelling the company to standardize the process management. He said.
Pan Lifen, deputy director of the Certification and Supervision Division of the State Administration of Market Supervision, said that service certification is based on customer perception, concern about organizational quality management and satisfaction of service characteristics.
Since 2004, after more than 10 years of development, the service certification project has undergone a process of gradual development, such as financial service certification, mother-and-child care service certification, commodity after-sales service certification, e-commerce service certification, health service certification, etc.
According to statistics from the State Administration of Market Supervision, at present there are more than 130 service certification bodies in China, more than 2,000 service certification personnel, nearly 8,000 valid certification certificates.
Pan Li-fen said that we should further guide and promote the development of service certification, gradually expand service certification coverage in health, education, sports, finance and e-commerce fields, and promote supply-side reform and quality improvement in service industry.
Reuters, Hong Kong, November 5 - Hong Kong property prices fell for two consecutive months after the peak. Mr Chan, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, said Monday that the fashion needs time to observe whether the property market has entered the downward cycle. If confirmed, the tightening of counter-cyclical measures can be considered at the appropriate time.
Mr Chan added that if property prices were to recur, the first to be affected would be those who bought their property at the peak of the property market, but it was expected that there would be a sharp fall in property prices during the Asian financial turmoil in 1997 and a much lower chance for the public to sell their properties at sharp price cuts.
Speaking at the Legislative Council Briefing, Chan Tak Lam, a number of senior officials of the HKMA, said that if it is confirmed that the property market is entering a downward cycle, the measures could be relaxed in due course.
“However, we only see the data for a few weeks. It is still too early to talk about relaxation. It will still take more time to see if the property market enters the downward cycle. ”
Since October 2009, the HKMA has introduced eight rounds of counter-cyclical measures to significantly tighten mortgage mortgages for all types of properties, including reducing mortgage matrium and requiring mortgage applicants to pass rigorous stress tests to enhance bank risk management and seismic resistance.
With Hong Kong officially entering the rate hike cycle, the Hong Kong private residential property price index peaked for two consecutive months, the monthly decline in September increased to 1.44%.
However, the cumulative increase in the first three quarters of this year remained 10.2 per cent.
According to the HKMA, the financial position of households measuring the resilience of Hong Kong to financial risks is still healthy. In the second quarter of this year, the ratio of households without mortgage was 66 per cent, higher than the average of 60 per cent in 2009-11. The average number of newly granted mortgages and the contribution to income ratio of newly granted mortgages was 47 per cent and 34 per cent respectively, compared with 2009 - 1164% and 41% have improved significantly.
However, Chan Tak Lam said that the high earthquake resistance does not mean that residents who have already purchased property will not suffer from economic downturn, as property valuation will fall and those who buy property at peak times will bear the brunt.
Although the HKMA tightens bank lending to mortgage lenders, home buyers can also obtain high-yield mortgage loans through mortgage insurance or mortgage loans provided by developers.
Mr Chan said that at present, together with mortgage loans provided to developers, borrowers can have a mortgage of 85- 90%. If property prices fall by 10%, there will be negative assets (i.e. the market value of the property falls below the total amount of outstanding mortgage loans).
However, HKMA Vice President Nguyen Kwok-hang pointed out that the authorities estimate that the total amount of mortgages provided by developers is only 2-2.5 per cent of the bank's mortgage, which is still low.
At the peak of Hong Kong's negative assets in 2003, the number of negative assets exceeded 100,000, accounting for 22 per cent of the housing population.
As of the third quarter of this year, Hong Kong recorded zero negative assets for the seventh consecutive quarter.
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 1 (Liu Hongxia, Ma Rui) E-commerce retail export enterprises on October 1 ushered in another wave of tax negative positive, involving VAT, excise tax exemption and other aspects.
The Ministry of Finance, the State Administration of Taxation, the Ministry of Commerce and the General Administration of Customs have jointly developed a civilized process recently that the export of goods that do not obtain valid proof of purchase, and at the same time meet the following conditions, the tax exemption policy for value-added tax and consumption tax shall be applied on a trial basis.
First, e-commerce exporting enterprises registered in the comprehensive test area and registered export date, cargo name, unit of measure, quantity, unit price and amount in the cross-border e-commerce online comprehensive service platform at the place of registration.

Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic problem involving multiple organs of the whole body and was previously considered an incurable disease.
Because of the unknown pathogenesis, the difficulty of diagnosis and treatment, and the lack of effective treatment.
Recently, Liu Wanli, researcher at the School of Life Sciences of Tsinghua University and Li Zhanguo, director of the Rheumatology Immunology Center of Peking University People's Hospital, discovered that human immunoglobulin increased susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus, and this variation was involved in regulating immune B cells.
In short, the teams confirmed that an abnormal immune molecule in the human body is an important cause of SLE.
According to Sun Xiaolin, Peking University People's Hospital, Li Zhanguo team collected nearly 2,000 large samples of systemic lupus erythematosus patients with immunoglobulin mutations, and found that the incidence and severity of inflammation such as nephritis, arthritis, seritis and vasculitis increased significantly.
Liu Wanli team discovered the pathogenic mechanism of immune signal activated by this immune molecular mutation and promoted the secretion of various autoantibodies in B cells through immune cell tracking, animal testing and sequencing.
The reporter learned that the two teams are strong and united, making full use of their respective strengths, and realizing a close combination of basic research and clinical applications.

“This study is one of the results of many years of collaboration between the two teams and the first academic community to recognize that immunoglobulin gene abnormalities will induce systemic lupus erythematosus, which provides a solid foundation for further academic research and clinical targeted treatment. ”
This is not a short guard, but a matter of law.
Lawyer carries an axe to the court for a hearing?
The news was really stimulating at first glance, and also blew the pot in the legal circle.
Quanzhou City, Fujian, China and France then fined the lawyer involved 500 yuan, and advised Quanzhou City Bar Association to investigate and deal with it.
According to the Beijing News report, Quanzhou City Lawyers Association issued an official notice a few days ago that the actions of the two lawyers do not involve illegal and illegal acts, and they are not punished according to the law.
Judging from reports from various sources, the Quanzhou Lawyers Association's handling is not short-care or confrontation, but has been approved by the Quanzhou Intermediate Court.
An incident that could have triggered tensions within the legal community was finally resolved properly.
The reverse stems from a more complete restoration of truth: the axe carried by the lawyer in question is of the same type and model as the defendant's murder weapon, but unblinded, only as supporting evidence during the evidentiary stage, without intimidation or subjective intent to “endanger the security of the court”.
There are four very important details to determine whether the lawyer's actions are illegal: first, the local court held two previous sessions, showing only an ax photograph, which is necessary from a defence point of view; second, the axe was purchased one hour before the hearing, not the lawyer was reluctant to seek the judge's consent, but objectively failed to reach the judge; third, the whole axe was not excessively or unduly., and fourth, the lawyer in question admitted publicly and apologized to the court for the first time.
Combined with these circumstances, it can be seen that the lawyer involved “brought an axe to court” has nothing to do with it, but for the sake of defence.
After clarifying the entire facts, the Quanzhou Bar Association did not push the boat, but instead withstood pressure and made a decision not to punish.
This decision also stood the test of fact and law.
As for the axe to be brought to court as a control tool without the permission of the court, it is indeed prone to anxiety and misunderstanding.
For reasons of security and caution, Quanzhou Intermediate Court's previous fines and judicial recommendations are also unjustifiable.
In order to safeguard the dignity of lawyers and prevent the abuse of lawyers by individual courts, in 2014 the Supreme Law issued the Rules for Security Inspection of the Judicial Police of the People's Court, establishing the principle that lawyers do not need to carry out personal security checks when they appear in court.
Since the issuance of the Rules, lawyers have led by example, and few incidents have occurred because of security loopholes that jeopardize the security of the court.
In rare cases such as Quanzhou, as long as communication is carried out in a spirit of mutual respect and understanding, misunderstanding is not difficult to eliminate.
As a self-regulatory organization in the legal profession, the Bar Association has the dual mission of punishing and safeguarding lawfulness.
In the past, individual associations have been criticized for their emphasis on retribution and lack of protection.
And the decision of the Quanzhou Bar Association, both in terms of process and results, is commendable, setting an example for more lawyers to perform their duties properly.
From October 1, which tax benefits will affect our money bags?
Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 1 (Reporter Sang Tong) The new personal income tax law will come into effect on January 1, 2019, in order to allow the general public to enjoy tax reduction dividends as early as possible, from October 1, will be the first to the taxpayer actually earned salary income at the starting point of 5000 yuan per month, and apply the new tax rate schedule.
With the New Deal landing, what are the benefits that will affect the people's money bags?
Good 1: The tax reduction on salary income is noticeable
Taxpayers who receive wages after October 1 may deduct the basic deduction fee of RMB5,000 per month and apply the new tax scale. Most taxpayers have different degrees of tax reduction, especially for low- and middle-income people.
According to the tax deductions table of different income groups, the monthly income of 8,000 yuan, 10,000 yuan, 20,000 yuan and 50,000 yuan after deduction of “three insurance and one gold”, the taxable amount after the tax reform is 90 yuan, 290 yuan, 1590 yuan and 9090 yuan respectively. Compared with the monthly threshold of 3,500 yuan, the corresponding tax reduction ratio is 73.9 percent, 61.1 percent, respectively.49.0%, 18.8%.
It is worth noting that due to holidays, units at the end of September should have been issued in October according to the law, the new basic deduction fee and tax schedule can be applied.
To this end, the withholding client software, which is widely used by the tax department, has already provided the corresponding tax calculation function, but the corresponding tax is still required to be reported within the statutory filing period.
Good two: low tax rate gear distance significantly widen
In addition to raising the threshold, a new tax scale will be applied from 1 October.
The salary and salary income seven-tier tax rate is consistent with the previous, but the tax grade distance has changed markedly, with 3, 10, 20 and 20 grades of low tax rate significantly expanded, 25% of the tax grade distance has narrowed, while 30, 35, and 45 percent of the three grades of higher tax rates remain unchanged.
It is worth noting that the tax law also adjusts the income of production and operation, among which the lower limit of the highest 35% tax rate is raised from 100,000 yuan to 500,000 yuan.
This means that both individual businesses and individual wholly owned partnerships will benefit from the tax reform.
“Judging from the previous measurement of tax reduction for Shanghai taxpayers, the vast majority of taxpayers will fully feel the dividends of individual tax reform, especially for low- and middle-income people. ”
Lan Min, head of the Personal Income Tax Department of Shanghai Taxation Bureau of the State Administration of Taxation, said.

On the other hand, the tax policy of “all-round, multi-dimensional and three-dimensional” will be promoted to the general public of taxpayers.
Use Shanghai tax official website, WeChat public number, Weibo and other channels to promptly push policy hotspots to ensure that policy publicity is in place.
Meanwhile, since September 28, Shanghai Tax WeChat public number was launched on 12366 intelligent consulting platform, through “artificial + smart” tax service consulting, to carry out “targeted” intelligent integrated individual tax reform promotion service.

According to foreign media reports, Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland and U.S. Trade Representative Leithezer said the United States, Canada and Mexico reached a tripartite trade agreement, the agreement will be called “USMCA” (USMCA) (USMCA).

The election of the governor of Okinawa, which was held early due to the death of former governor Oung Chang Yoshii, was announced early on the 1st local time. Danny Tamachi, who opposed the relocation plan of the US military base in Japan, was successfully elected.
The election was counted on September 30, and the final results showed that Tamaki won a total of 3966.32 million votes, making the most votes in the history of Okinawa prefectural governor election, more than 80,000 votes than its main competitor.
A total of four candidates participated in the election, with a turnout of 63.24 per cent, a decrease of 0.89 percentage points from the 2014 Okinawa Prefectural Governor election.
Yu Cheng said to the media on the 1st that the election results showed that the people of the prefectures did not want Governor Weng's efforts to be wasted. He will inherit Governor Weng's legacy and continue to make efforts to the Japanese government and the US government on opposing the relocation plan of the US military base and the closure of the Putenjian base.
Utenma US military base is located in Ginowan, Okinawa Prefecture, and has been criticized. The Japanese and US government agreed to move it to the Oeno area of Nago City. However, the people of Okinawa strongly opposed it and hoped that the base would be completely relocated out of Okinawa.
And with regard to the relocation plan strongly opposed by the county residents and the request to withdraw land reclamation permits along the ancient coast of Binno, Yusheng said that he had not stood in opposition and secession positions with the central government at the beginning. He hoped that the two sides would fully exchange views and show their intention to resolve them through consultation.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also expressed to the media on the morning of the 1st that earnestly accept this result and will make efforts to revitalize Okinawa and reduce the burden on the base.
Japanese Chief Secretary General Kan Yiwei said at a press conference on the 1st that the government's policy on moving US military bases as soon as possible has not changed.
At the same time, he also expressed his intention to hold talks with Yusheng.
Tamagi will take office as Governor of Okinawa Prefecture on the 4th of this month.
Since the mid-2000s, Paul Thomas, a farmer in North Dakota, has grown more and more soybeans in his land as demand for oilseeds in China has grown.
This shift peaked this year, when he planted 1,600 acres of soybeans in 5,000 acres of land, reaching an unprecedented scale.
But Thomas and many farmers like him plan to plant the former staple food crop in the U.S. agricultural areas in 2019: corn and wheat.
American farmers this year have grown soybean more than corn, for the first time in 35 years.
The plan to switch to other food crops is because US farmers face difficulties selling soybeans against the backdrop of US President Trump's trade war against China.
China usually buys about 60 per cent of U.S. exports of soybeans, but in recent months, because of trade wars, soybean prices have fallen to a 10-year low.
Thomas intends to grow more wheat next year, hoping to earn more by reducing dependence on crops that depend on Chinese demand.
Thomas said that soybean prices “brought us a hard blow.”
He stated that the spot price of soybeans near his farm was $7.10 per busel without the need for Chinese purchase, while the price necessary to cover the cost was $8.50.
Farmers in the United States set a record high in soybean cultivation this year, and the harvest is expected to hit a record high.
It was at such a very vulnerable moment that they were hit by a trade war.
For Trump to impose tariffs on imported Chinese goods, China imposed import tariffs on imports of US soybeans in July.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture will issue its first estimate of the area under cultivation next year, which is expected to include consideration of the impact of tariffs.
It is expected that this estimate will confirm the expectation of a reduction in soybean sowing area by civil institutions.
According to a Reuters report, Informa Economics predicted on October 19 that maize cultivation will increase by 4% to 92.7 million acres (37.5 million hectares) in 2019 and soybean cultivation will decrease by 7% to 83 million acres.
Informa also expects a 4 per cent increase in wheat cultivation in the United States.
The area of soybean planted before retaliatory tariffs rose to 89.6 million acres this year, about 15 million acres higher than 10 years ago.
Maize cultivation has increased by less than 5 million acres since 2008 to 89.1 million acres, and this year wheat cultivation stands at 47.8 million acres, close to the lowest level in 100 years.
Aron Carlson, president of the Illinois Corn Growing Association, has a total area of 3,600 acres, and he will spend nearly half this year on soybeans, but plans to reduce it in the future.
He claims that his farm in northern Illinois may increase maize cultivation by up to 20 per cent; the state is the largest soybean growing state in the United States.
The yield per acre of soybean is lower than that of corn, but requires less fertilizer, which makes soybean cultivation costs generally lower.
If farmers move to final maize, it may increase costs, but it will benefit a number of businesses, including Andersons Inc fertilizer distributors.
Andersons CEO Pat Bowe told Reuters that he expected a change to corn would benefit fertilizer use.
Bayer is also expected to benefit from the conversion of farmers to maize.
Sutirawa, director of Bangkok Don Mueang Airport Authority, called for a development conference on the 29th, apologized for a Chinese citizen being beaten at that airport, and said Thailand welcomed Chinese tourists.

Xinhua International Review: Defending multilateralism, China's knowledge and practice unity.
At a time when unilateralism is rushing, international rules and the multilateral order are under shock.
To some extent, the confrontation between unilateralism and multilateralism has entered a critical period.
As a responsible Power, China has joined the international community in safeguarding multilateralism and pushing it forward with its philosophy of good momentum and a solid and forceful action.
Faced with the new situation and new challenges, China has made a loud voice on the direction and path of multilateralism.
As State Councillor and Minister for Foreign Affairs Wang Yi said in his speech at the general debate of the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly, multilateralism in the new era should be based on cooperation and win-win, based on a rule-based order, with fairness and justice as a focus on effective action.
At the same time, China calls for the establishment of a global development cooperation pattern with the United Nations at its core, North-South cooperation as the main channel and South-South cooperation, and calls on all parties to work together to build a community of human destiny.
China's reflections and voices reflect the mainstream voice of the international community.
As Espinosa, President of the 73rd session of the General Assembly, said, in the current situation, “the United Nations needs more than ever to promote multilateralism and uphold a rules-based international system”.
International Monetary Fund Managing Director Lagarde said that the international community should continue to firmly uphold the multilateral trading system, adhere to international trade rules, and resolve differences through consultation.
In recent years, the adjustment of global economic and political forces has led to the emergence of some emerging markets and groups of developing countries to play a greater role in the main international multilateral mechanisms, providing a new impetus to the development of a confronted multilateralism.
Standing on this dimension, the concept of multilateralism, such as building a large family rather than patchwork small circles and insisting on building together instead of making winners, is in keeping with the trend of the times and is an inevitable choice for addressing global challenges and solving world problems, representing the common aspirations of most countries in the world.
There are advanced ideas, more solid actions.
China's “One Belt and One Road” initiative has become the largest platform for international cooperation.
China has launched international and regional cooperation initiatives such as the “Belt and Road”, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the “16 + 1 Cooperation” to promote international and regional cooperation, improve and supplement the existing international system and order, bring innovative vitality to multilateral cooperation and contribute to the development of the international order in a more just and reasonable direction.
As the guardians of the international order and the practicer of multilateralism, China's actions are increasingly strong in the multilateral arena of the United Nations.
Good offices in international hotspots, climate change, participation in peacekeeping operations, poverty reduction and poverty reduction, and support other countries in implementing the 2030 sustainable development agenda.
As United Nations Secretary-General Guterres said, China has become an important pillar of multilateralism.
When the “trust deficit” faced by the world worsened and the trend of populism and polarization rose, it was time for the world to demand multilateral cooperation most urgently.
At such a historic juncture, the international community needs to join hands in turning consensus into action, resolutely defending multilateralism and jointly promoting the building of a community of human destiny.

How to educate children and young people with disabilities was an important topic in this seminar.

For disabled children and adolescents, social attention is also given to “sexual protection”.
The seminar aims to promote comprehensive sexuality education for children and adolescents with disabilities in China from family support, school education, and institutional services, and to provide them with the right to enjoy love at the source.
Experts believe that all along, the public's awareness of disabled groups in Chinese society has remained at a level not deep enough.
Affected by traditional attitudes and other factors, comprehensive sexuality education for persons with disabilities, especially children and adolescents, has not been sufficiently advanced in China.

On the evening of September 20 this year, Qiao, a student studying in Zhengzhou's third year, took a car to Hebi.
An uncle on the train bought no seats, but took up her seat: “Shoot it.”
Two hours by car, the commander advised him an hour still invalid.
In the end, a male passenger in the same car could not look down and pulled the uncle up.
According to public opinion, although most of the final results were that hegemonists were condemned by the public, were administratively punished by the public security department, and even included in the honesty blacklist, the public still felt that they were not “dissolved”: why should they not be punished on the spot?
Why is it not possible to stop their immoral or even illegal actions on the spot, but to punish them afterwards?
And with regard to the irrational behavior of “uncle domineering”, how could it be only a male passenger who was “uneven in his way” and pulled him up?
The main reason is that only long-distance trains are equipped with police, but short trains generally do not. Even if there are police, the police take care of the possible rogue reaction of the hegemonists and do not take forced removal measures.
The repeated incidents of hegemony have made people realize that the hegemony must be forcibly removed or even punished on the spot in order to be deterred.
This requires that the police on trains be dare to take strong measures in a timely manner, and that trains without police should be equipped as soon as possible to prevent and suppress illegal acts in a timely manner.

To activate rural consumption, we need to rely on the normalization mechanism to purify the market, guide healthy consumption demand, and enhance farmers' sense of gain in consumption.
Data show that the consumption potential of rural residents continues to be released, the retail sales of rural consumer goods rose 10.5 percent in the first half of this year, and the growth rate is 1.3 percent higher than in towns.
In a western county a poor village visited, the village only one convenience store, went into the store, some goods deja vu, “golden dragon fish” labeled “golden dragon oil”, “wangsai” became “wang milk”, “cottage” goods a lot.
Over the years, similar phenomena have been frequently exposed. Some rural fake and poor commodities are close to famous brand names, similar names, similar packaging, and real fake, which makes it possible to guard against.
A western city released a consumer survey report showed that rural merchants super-fake problem is serious, 66% of users bought fake goods in township supermarkets, of which food accounted for more than half.
Relevant departments clean up the rural market and shout every year. Why is “Li Ghost” still fighting again and again?
Unlike urban markets, farmers' awareness of rights protection is relatively weak. In addition, many rural areas are remote and are in blind areas where supervisory power is not enough, so that fake and inferior goods have breeding ground.
A commodity bull tube, some departments control the price, some tube production, some tube market, function crossover, annual counterfeiting, centralized control of a gust of wind, fake goods escaped the wind, and slowly came out, just after the old fake, new fake came out.
The lack of a long-term regulatory mechanism, the rural market is difficult to purify, the illegal costs are low, and the benefits are large. This has led some illegal traders to “go up and down to the countryside” and some rural areas become “waste markets.”
From subsistence to well-being, the vast majority of farmers are moving towards development consumption.
Recently, the Party Central Committee and the State Council issued “Some Opinions on Improving the Institutional Mechanism for Promoting Consumption to Further Stimulate the Consumption Potential of Residents”, which proposes to promote the upgrading of the consumption ladder of rural residents, with the aim of enabling the vast majority of farmers to “consume” and “dare to consume” and to make rural consumption truly flourish.
On the one hand, we need to deepen reforms, eliminate multiple and multi-head management weaknesses in market supervision and administration, improve the food safety and product quality supervision network, constantly compress the rural space for counterfeiting and selling fake.
On the other hand, law enforcement efforts must be stepped up and supervision of “capillaries”, and will never allow counterfeiting and inferiority to breed and spread in rural areas.
Strongly punishing farmers is the protection of farmers. No matter how much concealment they hide, they should not become a reason for the breeding of counterfeit goods. Relevant departments should clearly define their responsibilities, and grass-roots supervisory power sink. Whichever link goes wrong, they should be held accountable and let those who make counterfeit or sell counterfeit have no place to hide.
Strict market access, strict qualification checks are applied to producers and operators, and market circulation is maintained, so that products come and go straight and clear, and find a way from the source and root, so that legitimate distributors can operate at ease, so that farmers can buy at ease.
Activate rural consumption, to guide healthy consumption demand.
Along with the escalation of consumption, many farmers not only seek to eat well and eat well, but also pursue a quality life such as culture and health. They cannot equate rural markets with “low quality” and “cheap”.
This needs to promote the extension of e-commerce to rural areas, open up two-way distribution channels between urban and rural areas, promote the integration of offline industrial development platforms and online e-commerce trading platforms, support the expansion of new models of consumption to rural markets; promote the organic integration of commercial logistics with leisure agriculture, rural tourism, product processing, etc.; improve the modern rural distribution network system, optimize the integration of stock facilities, and effectivelyReduce rural circulation costs.
To create a clear and secure market environment for rural areas, so that farmers do not worry about consumption, rural consumption can be more and more prosperous, so that farmers can increase their sense of acquisition and happiness.
