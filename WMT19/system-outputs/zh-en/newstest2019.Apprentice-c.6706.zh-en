&quot; Even if the United States Navy is reviving its power to deal with increasingly worrying Russia on both sides of the Atlantic , the United States continues to expand the region to include the Indian Ocean - Asia-Pacific - as the Navy , &quot; says William McCorner , deputy US naval commander .
On September 24 , the United States listed China as a strategic competitor in the new defense strategy published by the United States , according to the British Defense Week .
Since then , the United States Navy resumed its second fleet to deal more directly with Russia &apos;s activities .
These actions have raised questions and concerns among allies and analysts , who fear that the US Navy may be far away from the Obama ’ s &quot; Asia-Pacific rebalancing &quot; strategy .
&apos;The US Navy remains focused on the West Pacific , &apos; he said .
&quot; For us , there is no significant change for us , &quot; he said at a round-table discussion entitled &quot; Meeting the high seas &quot; on 24 January 2018 .
&quot; The focus remains rebalancing , the shift in focus , or whatever you want to describe . &quot;
But he acknowledges that the United States is close to Europe .
&quot; We will continue to focus on growth in the West Coast and balance what we can do , &quot; he said .
While he pointed out that the general policy on Russia was the terms of reference of the US Secretary of Defense , he warned : &quot; Russians may face demographic and economic challenges , but history proves that if we conflict with them , they will be very tough . &quot;
&apos;As part of the US ’ s resilience to Russia , China and other competitors , the US Navy is moving its troops into a “ new mode of warfare ” , which will help to allow rivals to find out where or not they will be deployed at any given time and location .
&quot; Our navy and the Marine Corps support it -- the concept of an unpredictability , &quot; he said .
It was reported that the first attempt to try this new approach was &quot; Harry Truman &quot; , an aircraft carrier , whose early deployment includes work visits to the port and patrols in the areas normally adopted .
The United States Navy is now working to ensure that its allies are still patrolling in traditional areas , and that logistics and family liaison are being addressed for new deployment procedures .
As part of the event , the Australian Royal Navy Commander Michael McCorner said that the Australian army could cooperate seamless with United States aircraft carriers .
He said that as Australia &apos;s Royal Navy plans to repurchase nine frigates with the &quot; Zeus Shield &quot; combat system , this will continue .

As of May 5 , the United States midterm election vote had been closed .
On 4 November , President Donald Putin worked with the Democratic Party to the core of their core voters .
It has been pointed out that voter turnout will be the key to that .
It is reported that in the 48 hours before the American popular vote , he was busy at the party of Republican candidates , and former President Barack Obama went to Indiana , the Democratic Union of the Democratic Senate of the Democratic Union of the Democratic Party , and his final claim to the crowd .
&quot; You must vote on Tuesday , &quot; he said . &quot; You must vote on Tuesday , &quot; he said on 4 November .
&quot; The comparison of the election is unlikely to be clearer . &quot;
The political enthusiasm of voters has risen to a rare peak , and some states are in advance .
The President of the United States faces the first midterm election , which is often reduced .
According to a new poll published by the Washington Post and ABC News ( ABC News ) 4 , the Republicans can benefit from economic assessments and the strict focus on border security , despite the fact that the Democratic Party of the Democratic Party remains competitive .
Opinion polls show that voters like the Democratic House of Representatives more than Republicans , a 50 per cent ratio to 43 per cent , but the 14 percentage points ahead of August .
Another poll by the US National Broadcasting Corporation ( NBC ) and the Wall Street Journal shows that Democrats still lead seven percentage points for Republicans .
Obama is known to say , &quot; When people don &apos;t tell the truth , when a speech does not represent anything , &quot; Obama said .
When people can only lie and lie , democracy cannot work . &quot;
&quot; The only way to stop these Republicans now is you and your vote . &quot;
The Democrats are at the top of the Senate for decades , and the Republicans now hold over 51 seats .
But the House of Representatives is more favourable , and the Democrats will need more than 23 seats to control the House of Representatives with 435 seats .
Analysts are expected to expect the Democrats to win up to 85 % of the House of Representatives .

In the current wave of &quot; popular entrepreneurship , innovative innovation &quot; in Beijing on November 5 , a growing number of science and technology companies began to focus on patent development and related protection , the potential value of patents and market ownership .
Similarly , a number of scientific and technological enterprises have experienced significant violations in terms of patent licensing and patent use .
At the end of 2017 , on the basis of patent violations from Guangdong , Guangdong , China , China and China ( hereinafter referred to as China Pacific ) .
The three plaintiffs requested the Court to stop the manufacture , sale , promised sale and use of the plaintiff &apos;s patent .

Visit to the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Association of Science and Industrial Research :
&quot; China &apos;s science and technology have developed rapidly over the past few decades , and the two countries work together in the field of science . &quot;
Mr. Larry Marshall , the chief executive of the Australian Federal Institute for Science and Industrial Research , said in Beijing that cooperation in the field of science and technology could be demonstrated by cooperation in the field of science and technology , in cooperation with the SEA .
As the largest national scientific institution in Australia , it has made many innovative research achievements in the oceans , energy , biology , materials , astronomy and so on .
It has maintained close cooperation with scientific institutions such as the University of China .
&quot; This is a lasting friendship that contains a tradition of trust and long-term cooperation with partners , &quot; Marshall said .
In May this year , China ’ s 500 metres of high-calibre spherical radio telescopes -- the &quot; China Pavilion &quot; , installed an international 19 band L band receiver .
At present , the world &apos;s most advanced 19 MV receivers are developed jointly by scientists in the field .
Marshall indicated that the successful development of the receiver was based on the accumulation of technology over the years , and that it would increase by 5 to 6 times , and that more scientific observations would be expanded .
&quot; This is one of the power to make a contribution . &quot;
In addition to the above cooperation , the Department has worked closely with Chinese scientific institutions in building a square kilometre array radio telescope , R &amp; D and energy-saving reduction .
&quot; Previous scientific research is often focused on the question of the future , and there is now a need for more scientific research to solve the problems of the problem . &quot;
Marshall believes that the two countries are complementary in the field of scientific development , while both countries face a series of challenges in development .
For example , extreme weather occurs globally , and drought and floods have led to food reductions and food shortages have severely affected human development .
At the same time , problems such as ageing , ageing , chronic diseases are also serious challenges .
&quot; The cooperation between the two countries in recent years is mainly aimed at addressing these challenges . &quot;
According to Marshall , the International Southern Hemisphere Research Centre for the Southern Hemisphere , which is co-founded by the National Laboratory for the Marine Science and Technology of Qingdao , is focused on the relationship between the El Niño and La Niana phenomena and the establishment of early warning facilities for extreme weather , which can also alleviate food shortages caused by extreme weather .
&quot; In the current environment , science and technology innovation is difficult to complete alone , it needs very high costs , and the problems to be solved are very much , so cooperation is important today . &quot;
Marshall said the closer cooperation would be possible to make breakthrough progress , which was also the meaning of increased cooperation between the two sides in the framework of the Area .
&quot; Strengthening bilateral cooperation , which is primarily our cooperation in science and technology . &quot;
Marshall , for example , has recently developed a gold purification method that does not use cyanide , which is highly environmental because of conventional cyanide extraction , and many countries want to find a gold purification method for small environmental pollution .
&quot; We are very willing to bring this to China , and this is one of the results of our engagement in the Area . &quot;

North Korea , on Saturday , said to the United Nations that the continued imposition of sanctions in deepening the North &apos;s distrust of the US would not be possible to abandon nuclear weapons unilaterally .
Throughout the United Nations General Assembly , North Korea has adopted &quot; very friendly practices &quot; over the past year , including the cessation of missiles and nuclear tests , the dismantling of nuclear testing sites and the commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology .
&quot; But we did not see any response from the United States , &quot; he said .
&quot; Without trust in the United States , there is no confidence in our national security , in which case we can &apos;t give up the weapons unilaterally . &quot;
While it repeated North Korea &apos;s complaints against the United States against a &quot; phased &quot; approach to denuclearization , his speech was of great significance , as it did not completely reject unilateral denuclearization like North Korea .
Mr Kim , referring to Kim Jong-un and Mr Putin &apos;s joint statement on June 12 , agreed to work towards the “ denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula ” , which he promised to protect North Korea .
North Korea has sought to officially end the 1950 - 53 Korean War , but the United States says it must abandon nuclear weapons first .
The United States has also refused to relax its demand for sanctions against North Korea .
&quot; The United States insists on &quot; denuclearization &quot; , and increases the pressure on sanctions to reach the end of a high pressure , and even refuse to publish the declaration of war .
&quot; The idea that sanctions can make us think of it is that we do not know our people as daydreaming .
But the problem is that this continued sanctions are deepening our mistrust .
The United States president did not mention the second plan of the United Nations , mentioned earlier this week .
Instead , he stressed the three meetings between Kim Jong-un and South Korea over the past five months , and said : &quot; If the other party to denuclearization is Korea rather than North Korea , denuclearization will not become so stalemate . &quot;
China has announced a reduction in the import tariffs for the purpose of the sale of goods from 1 November 2018 .
This year , China has actively reduced import tariffs .
On 1 May this year , a total of 28 new drugs , including anti-cancer drugs , and anti-inflammatory alkaloid drugs , a total of 28 per cent of imports , were adjusted to zero .
At the same time , the tax on the production and import of anti-cancer drugs is significantly reduced .
On 1 July , the car and parts of the car for the purpose of 218 .
After lower taxes , China &apos;s car vehicle tax rate has been lower than the average of developing countries .
This will drive industry structural adjustment and resource optimization , accelerate the quality of the products and help improve the quality of products and services , and it is expected to drive the price of cars to a certain extent and make consumers more affordable .
On 1 July , the daily consumption of consumer goods for the purposes of the Pablo .
Domestic consumption of consumer goods is closely related to people &apos;s living life needs .
This is not only the number and intensity , but the average rate is 56 % .
Domestic consumption of consumer goods can benefit consumers directly and promote the competitiveness of domestic industries .
On 1 November , industrial products such as the commercial products , spare parts and raw materials for the purpose of the PLA were introduced .
The proper reduction of import tariffs on industrial goods urgently needed in parts of the country can attract more foreign investment , help increase domestic effective supply , boost industrial upgrading , and contribute to the global allocation of resources , production costs and lower pressure on domestic environment .
According to the relevant head of the Office of the National Council of China Customs Tax Committee , the following four autonomous subtitles , as well as the third step in the implementation of the negotiations on 1 July this year under the information technology agreement , will reduce China &apos;s total tariff level from 9.8 % in the previous year .
The adjusted total tariff was slightly higher than that of the European Union , lower than that of most developing countries , at a moderate low level , matching the status and development phases of China &apos;s developing countries .
The Director introduced the total tariff level as an important indicator of the degree of openness in China &apos;s trade in goods .
China , the first of the world &apos;s trade in goods , has a further economic base , but the quality and benefits of trade development have gaps compared to the developed economies and therefore should be appropriately reduced .
Tariffs are the protective means of compliance , which should be adapted to industrial competitiveness , to encourage good competition and excessive protection against industrial development and quality .
Tariff tariff adjusted to balance production needs and consumption needs .
Emphasis has been placed on reducing domestic demand , contributing to the upgrading of the industrial transformation , and striving to increase the quality of the market and the public to meet the upgrading needs of industrial structure and industry .
It must balance the capacity of fiscal revenue and industrial development .
In the selection of concrete goods and the range of goods , there is an integrated coordination between two markets , two aspects , production and consumption , and the development of the Chinese economy .
The head stressed that this year is the fortieth anniversary of reform and opening , and China &apos;s initiative to reduce the total import tariffs is based on China &apos;s own major initiatives to achieve high quality development , conducive to the integrated use of both international and foreign resources to improve the quality of domestic supply systems .
The actions and initiatives show that China will firmly pursue a mutually beneficial open strategy , firmly support economic globalization , firmly uphold the principles of free trade and the WTO &apos;s core multilateral trading system , and continue to draw the momentum of development from the world to the world , as well as the development of the world .
Serbia announced that it would meet tomorrow to discuss the situation in Kosovo
According to the Office of the President of Serbia , the President of Serbia has ordered the country &apos;s armed forces to enter the highest operational state , in view of the fact that the Kosovo Special Forces occupation of the water channel in the northern part of Kosovo .
On 29 September , the Minister of Defence of Serbian Ministry of Defence stated that the Serbian army had entered a comprehensive operational state .
It is stressed that , as long as the orders issued by the MSC are still valid , Serbia will continue to maintain monitoring of the current situation in Kosovo , regardless of the direction of the situation , which will respond .
On 29 September , in an interview , the Russian Federation reported that he had informed the parties of the current situation and would travel to Moscow on 2 October to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to seek support from Putin on Kosovo .
When asked whether Serbia would need Russian military support like Syria , it replied , &quot; I do not want a major military conflict on our territory . &quot;
It also said that it had entered the full operational state only to form a deterrent to prevent the occurrence of conflict , but it was also a clear warning that no violence in Kosovo would be tolerated .
It is related to the two initiatives in Kosovo that have raised the operational readiness .
According to the Serbian side , the ethnic Albanians were in the northern part of Kosovo for the arrest of hundreds of thousands of people living in the area , which had not violated any law .
It claims that , since the police head of Kosovo and Metohija , the head of the Serbian Government in Kosovo and Metohija , on 26 March this year , the Albanian community has escalated its regional situation and has carried out unhumane arrests and evictions against Serbs .
In addition , more than 100 persons from the Ministry of Interior of the Republic of Kosovo , including the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Kosovo , have been announced to have taken over the positions near the water pool in the Ravallak hydroelectric station , entering the ecological and sports centres near the dam in the northern part of Kosovo and blocking all roads nearby .
It was pointed out that this military adventure in Kosovo was carried out with the instigation of Western countries and that the actions of the Kosovo military had not been informed of the Serbian side in advance , in violation of chapter IX , paragraph 1 , of the Brussels Agreement , as well as the military technical agreement between the United Nations Security Council and the Security Council .
He has been criticized by the NATO Secretary-General , Stoltenberg , for criticizing Western countries &apos; hypocrisy on Kosovo .
The root causes of this conflict continue to be the hundreds of years of historical grievances between the regions of Kosovo .
With regard to Kosovo &apos;s attribution , the Serbian and Albanian sides have each other .
Serbia regards Kosovo as a national and cultural cradle for the nation , since Serbia has established its strongest country in the 12th century , and the Albanians have moved only after the Ottoman invasion and the north .
The Albanians insist that , as the ancestor of the Albanians , living in Kosovo from the 4th to 5th century BC , Kosovo is the territory of the Albanian community .
The subjective political division resulted in a violent conflict of different peoples , religions and cultures , resulting in fierce antagonism between Serbs and ethnic Albanians in Kosovo .
In 1912 , Kosovo Albanians first declared Albanian independence .
After World War I , a large number of Albanians living in the Balkans moved to Turkey , a relative rise in the proportion of Serbs , as the Serbs saw &quot; just taking back their own land &quot; , but by Albanians as the plunder of &quot; Great Serbia &quot; .
Kosovo has become a &quot; party &quot; in the Balkans .
In 1999 , armed clashes between Albanian separatists and Serbian forces and police in the Kosovo Liberation Army resulted in the bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in Serbia and Montenegro and the outbreak of war in Kosovo .
On 17 February 2008 , Kosovo unilaterally declared independence from Serbia .
Since then , there is a message that Serbia will normalize relations with Kosovo and sign a global and legally binding agreement , but it has not been possible because of historical ethnic and geopolitical constraints .
Just a month ago , he had made the first clear claim to separate the Serbs in Kosovo from ethnic Albanians , once again .

At present , there are millions of commemorative facilities throughout the country , each of which has been visited every year .
The heart is the strongest foundation .
Let the hero , defend hero , learn hero , love the hero , bring the spirit of the spirit into the national blood , and the &quot; hero monument &quot; will fall between the world and the deep heart .

From 27 to 28 September , the national workshop on the field of cotton and cotton was held on the occasion of the seminar .
In the course of the paper , the author learned that the aim of the study on the ecological environment and the ecological environment of Xinjiang was achieved , with the aim of improving the pollution of the ecological environment and the ecological environment in Xinjiang .
The research on the growth of cotton cotton was presented to the University of Agricultural agroforestry in Zhejiang , China University of Agricultural and Agricultural Sciences in China .
&quot; We have developed comprehensive cotton cotton comprehensive technology that can completely achieve cotton planting , can solve the problem of pollution and realize the green water . &quot;
The Chinese Academy of Sciences is a professor .
Xinjiang is the most important of China , according to national statistical offices , in 2017 the area of cotton cultivation in Xinjiang was 35 million , accounting for 61 % of the country &apos;s cotton area .
Since the introduction of China in 1982 , it has reached more than 5000 million years , and about 300,000 tonnes of its annual use .
Of these , the cotton rate reached 100 % , and it accounted for about 60 % of the total utilization in Xinjiang .
For cotton , cotton production can reach a total of 320 kg to 350 kg .
With the increase in the number of soil and water in Xinjiang , the low recovery rate in the soil , the gradual increase in the soil in soil , the damage caused by soil erosion , seriously affect agricultural sustainable development .
Not only did it cause serious contamination of soil , but also the quality of cotton fibre .
Currently , more than 1 / 3 of Xinjiang has achieved mechanization .
In 2017 , there were some 1400 million tons of cotton in Xinjiang .
It is difficult to remove in the processing process during the processing process , and the quality of textile products can be greatly affected in subsequent textile processes , and the quality of textile products is seriously affected .
On 28 September , the national workshop on the field of cotton and cotton was held in Beijing , Xinjiang .
In order to make efforts to solve the pollution , simplify the technology and improve the efficiency , the team led his team to take over eight years , implement the &quot; 619 619 &quot; cotton technology cultivation and the green development in Xinjiang .
Through innovative breeding , it was introduced to develop the new strains of the new strains of the new species , which were prematurely , colloidal , saline , and so on .
In the southern part of Xinjiang , a series of measures , such as a series of measures , have been adopted for the preparation of mechanical installations , deep planting depth and shallow buried , suitable planting density screening and reasonable chemical control .
At present , a model base of cotton cotton cotton is established , and the production of each hectare has been reached .
Cotton cultivation of cotton , achieved the green , green , environmental and comprehensive benefit .
After nearly six years of study and demonstration , the production and demonstration of cotton cotton can reach a total of 320 kg to 350 kg and possibly even higher .
&quot; There is a great prospect of extension of cotton cotton . &quot;
At present , the paper believes that it is now possible to solve the problem of soil pollution , but there are still some gaps in the economic benefits .
&quot; The support of the cotton industry will benefit the future . &quot;
The next step , he said , and his team will continue to carry out in-depth research and extensive application of cotton , making the industry of cotton cotton a great deal to solve the soil pollution problem .

On the morning of 1 October , in order to celebrate the 69 th anniversary of the founding of the People &apos;s Republic of China , Liu Jiang held a ceremony in the city .
According to the immigration control station statistics , as at 30 September , the number of passengers entering Hong Kong by high-speed rail station had exceeded 300,000 .
On the occasion of the 69th anniversary of our home country , the city of China is expected to meet on 1 and 2 October .
The press was seen by a journalist in the middle of the town , and a large number of Mainland visitors took up the National Day .
Mrs. Song , who has taken a quick step , told reporters that the National Day holiday was a rare holiday in the year , and that it was particularly happy and exciting to find this desire in the city of Hong Kong .
However , the current flight of Ningxia to Hong Kong is inconvenient , with the opening of the high-speed rail in Hong Kong , which finds that it can arrive at 7 : 3 a.m. at 7 : 3 a.m. in order to connect the city with the city .
He told reporters that &quot; the high-speed rail is so convenient and when it comes ! &quot;
On a daily basis , in Guangzhou , Shenzhen , Shenzhen , in the course of 70 hours of a train , there was a great deal of local residents .
A Hong Kong friend , who lives on the top of Shenzhen , is preparing to join Hong Kong &apos;s friends .
&quot; The interior of the National Day and Hong Kong are on holiday , and we intend to challenge ourselves , and we are not able to go to the 50 km . &quot;
He explained that if the high-speed rail was to be opened and convenient , the time was sufficient , and they were not afraid to try so long .
Mrs. Yang , from Dongguan , came to Hong Kong with a 10-year-old son to join Hong Kong in the piano game , and she proudly told reporters that her son had three years to pass the National Day .
She had been on the bus until she was on the bus , but she was worried that she had an impact on her son , and that this time , after a high-speed rail trip in Shenzhen , she was impressed by the arrival of the trip , and the trip to Hong Kong .
On 23 September , at 6 : 44 , the &quot; harmonious &quot; high-speed rail train ran from Shenzhen to the south , and a few minutes later , the train entered Hong Kong in the wide range of high-speed rail trains , which was a formal rail train in Hong Kong .
The integration of the city &apos;s 2.5 per cent high-speed rail network , direct rail to 38 long-distance sites throughout the country , also brings to the mainland passengers in different provinces .
In the light of a small vacation from Changsha from Changsha , he said to reporters that the high-speed rail could only sit in the city of Shenzhen , and train Hong Kong in the city of Hong Kong to train in the city .
&quot; It &apos;s more than imaginary , &quot; he said . &quot; There are no more than two minutes , &quot; he said .

According to the Trade Agreement subsidiary arrangement announced Monday , the new US - Mexico - Canada Trade Agreement will retain the ability of US President Donald Bush to implement a 25 % tariff threat to imported cars , while making it largely exempt from imports from Canada and Mexico .
If it imposes so-called “ 232 chapters ” on cars for national security reasons , Mexico and Canada would have a monthly quota of 2.6 million exemptions to the United States .
In accordance with the subsidiary arrangements , a pick-up truck produced in both countries will be fully exempted .
If he had a car tariffs , Mexico would receive a $ 10.8 billion tax exemption per year , and Canada would gain $ 33.1 billion .

Despite the lack of detail , the clear progress described above was sufficient to enable Mexico and the United States Government to halt their plans to publish the text of the two trade agreements and to give Canada more time to join the agreement .
In Mexico , the Mexican President-designate , the President of the Republic of Mexico , told reporters in Mexico that the Government of the United States has proposed new countermeasures to the Government of Canada , saying he will continue to push three countries into NAFTA .
The time has been delayed to submit the text of the two trade agreements to Mexico and the United States , as the Canadian and US government “ very seriously ” try to reach agreement , according to the Mexican and US government .

In a nursing heart in the capital of Pretoria , the capital of the South African capital , it is hard to see any abnormalities , but they are none of them .
The University of Pretoria declared : &quot; This is the first thing in the world that has traditionally been born in the form of a new style . &quot;
School scientists are working to study the reproductive reproductive system .
The director of the Institute of mammalian Research , Pretoria , said the two children born on 25 August were quite healthy and normal .
His team finally reached the breakthrough after 18 months of intensive experiments .
&quot; We collect sperm from a healthy body , &quot; he said in a media visit .
Next , the hormone content of the researchers , such as the researchers , is treated with the hormone content .
&quot; Fortunately , the results are successful , &quot; he said .
He said the researchers &quot; took several attempts , but surprise that they did not spend too much effort &quot; .
He said that the previous research breakthrough could be repeated , and scientists wanted to use this technology to save the large cats of the world .
The International Alliance for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) noted that the lion had been in the country in 26 countries and that the total number of surviving wild lions fell 43 % over the past 20 years .

&quot; We don &apos;t want this animal to do something , and they &apos;re going to face it . &quot;
He said that the new technology did not need to allow lion to be raised , but as long as it injected sperm into an impregnable body , as in North America and Europe .
South Korea &apos;s export decline in September was the largest for more than two years , but analysts attributed the downturn to fewer days and said the global demand for South Korean goods remained strong despite China ’ s tight trade tensions .
Indeed , South Korea exports increased daily last month .
In addition , the data released earlier showed a double-digit increase in exports in the first few weeks of September before a long vacation .
South Korea &apos;s exports fell in September as the largest since July 2016 , with a drop of 5.7 % from the estimated decline of 11 analysts .
The figures released on Monday showed exports of $ 506 billion in September , below $ 512 billion in August .
Despite fears that the rising trade dispute in China could lead to other export-dependent Chinese neighbours , South Korea grew 7.8 % of its exports to China in September and expanded its fourth consecutive month .
South Korea &apos;s exports fell by 11.8 % , as oil sales fell .
South Korean memory chips and the overseas sales of oil products grew by 25.5 per cent and 13.5 per cent , despite the fact that the market worries the so-called chip &quot; super cycle &quot; .
&quot; However , the impact of trade conflicts will be unavoidable , as South Korea &apos;s exports depend heavily on the US and the Chinese market . &quot;
Imports fell 2.1 per cent to $ 148 billion , or 3.1 per cent less than the Reuters survey forecast .
The trade surplus was $ 97 billion in September , up from $ 69 billion in August .
It is a positive factor for South Korea &apos;s exports that the US and the European Union , the United States , said the global manufacturing industry would remain free .
The statement states that “ the price of export prices resulting from rising oil prices will benefit exports in the second half of the year . ”
&quot; But the trade conflict between the US and China continues , and the market volatility following the US interest rate has intensified , and is the negative pressure on exports . &quot;
In September , exports rose to $ 2.6 billion per day , at $ 2.1 billion in August .
South Korea &apos;s Mid-Autumn Festival , which fell from 24 to 26 September this year , resulted in only a quarter working days in September .
South Korea &apos;s exports grew 4.7 % from the previous year .
South Korea ’ s manufacturing activity rebounded in September , according to the NBC / OTC , but it was backed by domestic orders , as orders from China and Japan fell , and the new export outlook was cloudy .
Korean media criticized the United States for not relaxing sanctions
The North Korean Daily , dated March 30 , 2001 , criticized the United States for seeking to engage in dialogue while not relaxing sanctions , calling it &quot; contradictory &quot; .
According to the article , Secretary of State , Secretary of State , &quot; The key to the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is to carry out sanctions &quot; , stressing that the United States has continued to follow the United Nations sanctions resolution .
In the joint statement of Singapore , the two sides committed themselves to the new relationship between the aspirations of the two peoples to hope for peaceful prosperity .
It is no doubt paradoxical that the United States has stepped up its sanctions and demands dialogue .
It is said that if a new relationship is to be established , a permanent peace regime built on the Korean peninsula and a complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula , the building of trust should be resolved in a phased and phased manner .
It also states that the United States should understand that sanctions will not work against North Korea .
It is said that even after the &quot; Battle of Man &quot; , the US military has been praised .
&quot; We &apos;re going to have a strong potential opponent . &quot; It &apos;s enough to see that the submarines are enough to see the submarines .
The incumbent of the United States military commander of the United States is also highly praised for the submarine .
&quot; The submarine is impressive , and looks at the development of the Russian navy and how resources are used , &quot; he said .
But the Journal of National Interest continues to believe that the United States maintains the advantage of Russia in this area .
&quot; I believe that the West still has asymmetrical advantages , &quot; he said .
It has been previously reported that it will be in the middle of next year ’ s &quot; Knight &quot; submarine .
The &quot; Wangshan &quot; , the &quot; Shopping &quot; , the &quot; Shopper &quot; , the &quot; Farm &quot; multipurpose submersible submersible submersible submersible submarines have been modified as the &quot; DM-M &quot; , with a total of 42.5 tons , 55.2 m depth depth , 64 personnel and 31 under water , and will carry mines , torpedo and &quot; caliber &quot; .

Ignoring the US threat !
The European Union , or Iran , with Iran
The United States Government has previously claimed that a new round of sanctions against Iran will be renewed in November , even urging other countries to reduce imports of Iranian oil .
America &apos;s allies , however , did not seem to listen .
According to the United States New York Times , the Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs , Zwaf , revealed that , while the US threatened to impose sanctions on any country doing business with Iran , Tehran was approaching a deal with the EU .
The core purpose of this agreement is to attempt to establish a new payment mechanism that would replace United States dollar transactions by means of barter or currency .
The aim of this approach is to try to circumvent the United States and prevent the United States from impeding financial transfers .
At the same time , while the EU is committed to the agreement , some French and British officials are worried that if the agreement is to be achieved , it will be the most open confrontation between the EU and the United States against the United States .
In an hour &apos;s interview , the language of Zwaf sounds more optimistic than in recent months .
Because the agreement has the ability to “ break ” the American traditional allies , effectively break the US &apos;s attempts to cut its revenues .
“ This ensures that we sell oil and benefit , ” Zarif believes that , according to the agreement reached in 2015 , States have legitimate rights to trade with Iran .
&quot; Any sovereign state or organization cannot accept other people to decide who is able to do business , &quot; he said before the EU Foreign Policy .
She also predicted , however , that US leaders could take a range of financial instruments to deal with banks , businessmen and countries with Tehran before the United States Government launched its next sanctions in November .
In May this year , the United States Government unilaterally announced its withdrawal from its agreement , saying that it could not permanently ban Iran from producing nuclear fuel .
The US then threatened to ban companies buying Iranian oil and other commodities in the United States .
The threat caused some companies to evacuate Tehran and the Iranian currency collapsed .
Companies such as China and France have cancelled billions of dollars in investment in investment .
British and French officials have said that the United States government may &quot; prevail &quot; .
According to a recent report by the Turkish media , US sanctions do not appear to have a significant impact on Iran &apos;s oil exports .
Iran has previously revealed that no other country has stopped buying Iranian oil except South Korea .
Mr. Zedarif and Iranian President Rouhani argued that a series of American acts were designed to &quot; tempt &quot; Iran to violate the agreement .
Zarif was also discredited with a string of verbal attacks by the US , and when asked whether the US would overturn the current Iranian government with an increasing fiscal pressure , Zrif could even laugh , &quot; it is a strategy for regime change , which is the real purpose of the US . &quot;

The central bank was aware that the long-term implementation of ultra-loose monetary policy could squeeze the profit margins of financial institutions and could undermine the stability of the banking system , Reuters said Monday .
But he said the Bank of Japan needed to maintain its massive stimulus plan , given the inflation downturn and uncertainty over the overseas economies , while closely focusing on the advantages and disadvantages of its policies .
&quot; The Bank of Japan has fully acknowledged that financial institutions will be increasingly affected by the continued monetary easing , &quot; said the Black House , in Nagoya &apos;s speech to business leaders .
If financial institutions are more active to take risks to compensate for the impact of low interest rates over the years , however , the banking system is likely to be volatile if there are serious negative shocks .
&quot; While these risks are not very small now , central banks will closely follow developments and encourage financial institutions to take the necessary measures , &quot; he said .
The Bank of Japan policy committee discussed the rising costs of long - term easing at the September meeting at the September session , released earlier Monday .
The minutes showed a member said that if the economy continued to expand , &quot; the Bank of Japan has more room for flexibility in policy . &quot;
According to the minutes , another member said that , given its limitations during the continuing policy period , the Commission should discuss how long the Bank could maintain stimulus .
&apos;The Bank of Japan will assess the financial risks posed by easing policies , while also taking into account uncertainty surrounding Japan ’ s economic prospects , and that trade frictions and rising protectionism may affect global demand , &apos; says Mr.
&quot; The impact of such problems on the Japanese economy is only limited , &quot; said the Black Marker .
&quot; But how the problem continues , the impact on Japan &apos;s economy may be big , &quot; he added .
&quot; There is a need for a sustained policy of monetary easing , taking into account positive and negative effects in a balanced manner , &quot; said the Black Marker .
Although the malaise of radical stimulus schemes , such as long-term low interest rates erosion of the profits of financial institutions , inflation has forced the Bank to maintain it .
The Bank of Japan maintained its monetary policy last month ; in the face of the risks posed by the global trade war , it ruled out the possibility of recent hikes .

For example , changes in the international economic environment have had an impact on some export enterprises ; the rapid adjustment of demand structures leads to transformational upward pressures ; some policies are uncoordinated and policy effects are simple , or simple , leading to the opposite role of good policies .
Various factors interwoven , the private economy experienced difficulties , some private enterprises faced difficulties , and entrepreneurs showed a lot of anxiety .
In this context , it is particularly relevant to correct the misconception of understanding , to remove the business of entrepreneurs , to keep the business in mind , and the government is committed to development , and to market confidence and development expectations .
The symposium once again highlighted the important proposition of &quot; three unchanging &quot; : &quot; The position and role of the economy in the economic and social development of our country has not changed ! &quot;
From deep forward to the development of the rule of law to create the rule of law environment in which to protect the legitimate rights and interests of entrepreneurs , to create a fair market environment and to shape the culture of entrepreneurship for the whole society .
The symposium also made clear its strong support for the development of the six policy initiatives of private enterprises and the introduction of a series of practical actions aimed at the private enterprise .
These are a great encouragement to the entrepreneurial community and more to the community .
In the light of the mist , the approach has been fixed .
To build a better environment for the private economy , to help private enterprises solve the difficulties of development , to promote the economic transformation of China , to make entrepreneurs feel fair in the market competition , to feel safe and to be respected in social life , to stimulate innovation and create potential .
China &apos;s economic entry into the process of high-quality development requires more entrepreneurs and more space and stage for entrepreneurs .
We have reason to believe that the private economy will usher in better development prospects and development opportunities and move towards a broader stage , as further obstacles and obstacles are to be overcome .

At 7.30 a.m. on the same day , the sun was just a corner , and the area where the port of the estuary was restricted was gathered early to see local people and foreign tourists .
At 0745 hours , it began on time , and at the port of the estuary border checkpoint , a team of men stood at the door and escorted the flag to the north .
After the command of the commander , he struggled to draw a arc , with the brightly bright light , like the &quot; eagle of eagle &quot; , and the melanonic melodies were rising slowly .

During the 73rd General Assembly , some positive information was released on the Korean peninsula .
South Korea &apos;s president has described the &quot; irreversible &quot; nuclear resolve to &quot; irreversible &quot; and said that US President Donald Jong-un and North Korea &apos;s top leader Kim Jong-un may meet before the end of the year .
The United States Department of State subsequently said the Secretary of State will visit North Korea in October to advance the commitment to meet Singapore &apos;s meeting in Singapore .
Since the beginning of this year , the road to dialogue between North Korea and South Korea , meeting with the leaders of North Korea , the leaders of the North Korean region , continued the large trend in the situation in the peninsula , and a dialogue to resolve the peninsula .
First , &quot; the essence of the peninsula is security , &quot; the key to the peace of the peninsula , the key to a proper and balanced solution to legitimate security concerns of the parties , rather than to pressure on each other and to emphasize the claims .
Secondly , in a dialogue on the denuclearization of the peninsula , the parties concerned have divided themselves on steps and modalities to achieve the denuclearization of the peninsula , with a long lack of political trust between the two countries , and the &quot; who followed &quot; game .
At the public meeting on the Korean peninsula , which had been held at United Nations Headquarters in New York , the various voices surrounding the issue of sanctions were once again highlighted in the peninsula .
The US Secretary of State has insisted that sanctions against North Korea will not be lifted until the Korean Peninsula complete denuclearization .
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov , while emphasizing the principle of &quot; action to respond &quot; , said : “ The downward trend in sanctions should be the same as that of North Korea on the road to gradual expansion . ”
There is no doubt that the parties concerned should continue to implement the Council &apos;s resolutions in full , complete and accurate , but that the pressure is not intended , the implementation of sanctions and the promotion of a political settlement are the demands of the Council &apos;s resolutions , which cannot be justified .
As the State Secretary of State and Minister of Foreign Affairs said , in view of the positive progress towards the Korean and Korean relations , China believes that it is necessary for the Council to consider the timely commencement of reversible provisions , thereby encouraging the DPRK and the parties concerned to take a further step towards denuclearization .
Looking back , the denuclearization of the Peninsula and every progress in the peace process will require sufficient political courage .
At present , in the face of the international community &apos;s growing expectation for a political solution to the peninsula , the parties , in particular , show political strength , political commitment , implementation of commitments , resolve the challenges , continue to move towards a parallel pace , move forward on the Peninsula &apos;s denuclearization process and establish the Peninsula peace mechanism and create a permanent peace for the peninsula .

Reuters , on October 1 , the Bank of Japan , released Monday by the Bank of Japan , showed that it had reached its lowest level for more than a year in September , owing to rising costs of raw materials and a series of natural disasters that affected production .
The survey has hardly shown that escalating global trade frictions have hit the confidence of large producers .
But the risk of a comprehensive trade war hit business prospects and could threaten corporate capital spending .
Active capital spending is a bright spot in the Japanese economy .
The survey raised questions about the Bank of Japan &apos;s view that robust economic expansion would help boost inflation to a 2 % target , despite signs that companies are gradually shifting costs to customers .
&quot; In the wake of a global trade war , there is a steady trend in confidence in China , due to slowing exports and weak production of factories , &quot; said Mr. Li , chief researcher at the Institute for Finance in agroforestry .
&quot; Confidence is still high , and I don &apos;t think confidence will continue to decline because the profits are improving and prices are rising . &quot;
In September , the major manufacturing index for manufacturing in September fell from 21 to 19 per cent in September , and has deteriorated for continuous growth .

Investors did not care about the decline in the index of the growth index , which rose from Monday to 27 per cent on Monday , as the yen &apos;s continued devaluation helped to improve the prospects for export earnings for Japanese firms .
Capital expenditure is robust .
Despite the decline in corporate confidence , the latest news market highlights the robust corporate capital spending plan , which has benefited from renewed production capacity and increased labour shortages for robotics and automation .
The central bank survey revealed that large businesses planned to increase capital expenditure of 13.4 % in the current year &apos;s financial year .
The previous survey was 13.6 % .
&apos;All corporate capital spending plans in the fiscal year grew by 8.5 % , close to the pace of the Japanese era .
&quot; There is still room for further growth in capital spending , given the high level of profits from small businesses , &quot; he said .
It is encouraging signs that Japan &apos;s efforts to combat deflation have been made by the fact that its ability to transfer costs has increased , and the output price index of the large enterprise is now 7 , it is 7 years .
The index of the employment situation of large enterprises hit negative 23 , the highest level since 1992 , and highlighted the employment market .
Thanks to strong corporate spending , the second quarter of the Japanese economy rebounded from the January - March contraction .

Speaking at the opening ceremony , the President of the International Federation of Astronautics , Jean-Ifowan , said the global network was no longer the only one in which a few countries and institutions were involved , and this year the number of participants increased significantly , indicating that more agencies and people were joining .
He called on States to strengthen their cooperation and innovation and to promote their development .
The Deputy Minister of Industry and Informatics of China , the Director of the Ministry of Industry and Technology , introduced the Chinese space plan in the event of a communication , and said that China would expand international cooperation in the field of space and contribute to human beings .
With the participation of relevant agencies , such as the Group , and some private sector representatives , the latest achievements have been demonstrated , including the launch vehicle , satellite and space science and technology applications .
The International Astronautical Congress has been held every year since 1950 and is the world &apos;s largest event .
This session , for five days , is co-hosted by the International Astronautical Federation , the International Astronautics and Microgravity Research Centre , and the International Space Law Institute .
According to Reuters , a press release released on Sunday by China &apos;s Foreign Trade Center on Sunday revealed that China &apos;s foreign trade situation is still complex , and business firms are expected to export more than a year or two in 2018 .
However , taking into account the rising costs of domestic raw materials , the labor force , and the external environment in which China &apos;s trade frictions have increased , the exhibition industry believes that the export situation next year .
At the 127th closing press conference , the Deputy Secretary-General , the Spokesperson of the press and the Deputy Director of the Foreign Trade Centre , China , said that the number of overseas buyers abroad and the export of their exports were on average .
The current purchaser reached 189,812 , from 215 countries and regions , down 1.11 % per year .
Exports amounted to a 1 % decline in the total amount of HK $ 21,92bn ( US $ 62bn ) .
From the market , Japan , ASEAN 10 , the “ BRICS ” and South Korea ’ s sales grew by 18.7 % , 11.4 % , 7.2 % and 2.5 % , respectively , in traditional markets , such as the United States , Australia , Canada and the European Union , respectively , respectively , respectively , respectively .
From the industry , transportation , mechanical equipment , construction and decoration materials , electronic consumer goods and information products , sales of electronic goods , 21.1 % , 15.1 % , 15.1 % , and 7.6 % , textile clothing and household appliances , respectively , decreased by 0.75 % , 6.7 % , respectively .
As a barometer and a barometer of China &apos;s foreign trade , the current market and export trading data show that China &apos;s foreign trade development is still facing uncertainty next year .
However , with the deepening of the supply side structural reform , as well as the recent national and local policy measures , the new momentum of China &apos;s foreign trade development is accelerating , and the diversification of enterprise market has continued to make progress , which is an important foundation and strong condition for foreign trade development .
&quot; On the whole , it is expected that China will maintain steady growth and improve quality and efficiency throughout the year . &quot;
The Chinese Customs Service published an annual increase of 14.5 % in United States dollars , while imports rose by 14.3 % on a year-on-year basis , with a trade surplus of US $ 1.75 billion in September .
In spite of the escalating trade frictions in China , China ’ s export performance in September continues to be significantly higher , with a strong interest in China ’ s foreign trade and the impact of the US trade war on confidence and the impact of the trade war on the industrial sector .
According to Reuters , the US fund manager proposed to increase cash holdings in September , maintaining a cautious stance , as the United States and China began the latest round of import tariffs , with no signs of easing .
However , the 12 fund managers involved in the survey recommended that the North American asset configuration be increased to the highest since June 2017 , while the United Kingdom , the eurozone , especially emerging markets , have declined .
Global equities accounted for an average of 0.75 per cent , while bonds accounted for 0.75 per cent , essentially with the survey last month .
The most obvious change is that the cash ratio has risen to 5.1 % , the highest since December 2014 .
&quot; Some economic data have confidence in the market , but the trade war remains the biggest concern , &quot; said a fund manager of a large fund company , and the trade war remains the biggest concern .
But fund managers still prefer stocks in September , particularly in the US , even if US equities are considered high prices .
Today , the China International Import Expo , the first of China &apos;s open landmarks in China , is the first major national exhibition on the subject of import .
A fair is like a &quot; window &quot; that allows the world to better understand a city and a country .
Through the &quot; window &quot; of the &quot; windows &quot; , people see a higher level of &quot; open China &quot; ; the &quot; window &quot; of the &quot; windows &quot; of the world , and the world &apos;s mutually beneficial and mutually beneficial China .
&quot; For a country , openness is like the old , but it is a pain of pain , but it will be new . &quot;
President Xi Jinping &apos;s summary of the open path is an important reason for &quot; why China can &quot; .
Looking after the reform and opening up for 40 years , the courage to push into the world world market , despite the vortex and wind waves , has always been open to all risk challenges , constantly releasing endogenous momentum and increasing competitiveness .
It can be said that China has made a strong interpretation of the value and significance of its own achievements .
On the new historical starting point , a major decision on the subject of import , with the aim of promoting a new round of high-level open doors , is a major step forward in China &apos;s initiative to open up the world , and it is a strong and clear will for China to support economic globalization and trade liberalization .
It is the biggest affirmation and best response to China in a larger , wider area and a deeper development of the open economy in a larger , wider area .
More importantly , the current global economic and trade order has reached a crossroads .
In some countries , the rise of trade protectionism and the return of unilateralism have increased the international community &apos;s concerns about the prospects for free trade , adding much uncertainty to the emerging world economy .
In such a background , this event , which reflects China &apos;s defense of free trade , has allowed the world to see open markets and share future Chinese confidence and China .
It &apos;s fast and far away .
China is open to the world , embracing the world , not only for its own development , but also to countries and regions of the world .
In recent years , it has promoted and promoted the development of a &quot; cross road &quot; , the launching of a sub-investment bank , the establishment of a fund for the establishment of a fund , and a series of international public goods providing real export markets , opportunities for development and employment , and the development of a &quot; train &quot; in China .
It is also a public product , a major platform for global economic cooperation .
On this platform , more than 3,000 enterprises in more than 130 countries and regions are taking a new step in China &apos;s market with the bright quality of products and services .
In addition to countries , the real benefits are domestic consumers .
Through the establishment of this platform for the &quot; selection &quot; , it provides a multi-channel quality supply for the promotion of consumption , meeting the people &apos;s personalization , diversification and differentiated consumer demand .
With the opening of the door to China &apos;s open door , it is more solid to move towards a good life .
From a more macro point of view , the sense of entry is beyond the scope of economic and trade , but a vision of the future , an open , inclusive , inclusive , balanced , win-win concept and a common understanding of the current challenges .
The world is good , China is good ; China is good .
We look forward to the success and success of the world to the world ; we hope to move towards a higher level of &quot; open China &quot; with the world to build the glorious future of the human destiny community .

The majority of Brazilian voters say presidential candidates have not considered women &apos;s needs .
According to the South American Grain Network , data released recently by the Brazilian National Institute of Geography indicate that more than 90 % of Brazilian women do not believe that presidential candidates consider women &apos;s needs .
According to reports , the number of women in Brazil has reached a number of over $ 770 million , and if women across Brazil are brought together to form a country , the country &apos;s population will be ranked 13 times the world &apos;s world population .
In Brazil , the number of women voters accounted for 52 % of total voters and 48 % for men , although women were very high among voters , but women accounted for only 10 % in Brazil .
Among the 193 countries in the world , the participation of Brazilian women in politics is only 154 , higher than the Arab countries .
After more than 20 years of struggle , Brazilian women still did not succeed in obtaining their own right .
The fact that this phenomenon exists is the result of old literature , racism , and capitalist values , according to the Brazilian sociologist , Nataliya Moss .
&quot; Politics should be a national advocate of civil rights , identity , access to public goods and the same society by multiple social groups , but Brazil &apos;s politics is a monopoly of a group and the majority of the population is not represented . &quot;
A previous study by the Brazilian locomotive Institute also noted that 94 per cent of Brazilian women did not feel that the politicians elected by the elections could represent their rights , 90 per cent of Brazilian women disagreed with the decision made by politicians and 93 per cent did not agree with current government governance policies .
&quot; We need to reverse the problem of the under-representation of women in Parliament , and the political system in Brazil continues to suffer from inequality . So far , there is still serious gender , class and racial discrimination in the political sphere in Brazil , &quot; said Natalia .
Despite the lack of women &apos;s rights , most Brazilian women still believe in democracy .
The survey shows that 76 per cent of women believe they can make a difference in democratic elections , with 72 per cent of women interested in politics .
In addition , 55 per cent of women believe that democratic politics is the best way to make women less biased .

As growth in Europe , Asia and emerging markets is largely unencouraging , the United States is increasingly becoming the main engine of global economic growth .
On 23 September 2018 , in New Jersey , United States , a container cargo vessel parked in the port .
But because the current growth in the US has benefited from the fiscal stimulus to tax cuts , the country &apos;s economy has been closely concerned .
&quot; As the United States is restoring full employment , the economic downturn is inevitable . &quot;
He said the only question was when it would happen , and in his view , it might not be possible .
Although Barclays was optimistic about the US economic outlook before the end of the year , the bank admitted that it was more difficult to predict more time .
&quot; In the absence of more sustainable investment growth to boost the potential for economic growth , the current growth in fiscal policy is unsustainable , &quot; said Barclays economists in a study .
&quot; In the absence of investment growth , the risk of a hard landing by 2020 will rise , &quot; they said .
A series of corporate surveys will show that major economies are in the middle of the cycle .
The eurozone and the US manufacturing survey scheduled to be released next Monday will be subject to attention , and the service industry will be published Wednesday .
But the focus on the next week will necessarily focus on the US nonfarm employment data , which will be published next Friday , which will provide clues about whether the job market in China is driving a sharp increase in pay .
Its importance is important not only for its profitability and the purchasing power of consumers , but also because of the low pay rate or the rise in overall inflation , which may be disquieting by officials of the Federal Reserve .
&quot; Pay will be paid attention , as it is likely to increase sharply in the previous month .
The increase may not exceed 3 per cent in September compared with the previous year , but we can only expect a breakthrough next month , the Dutch International Group economists wrote in a study .
European politics may be a source of market volatility when vacations in China and elsewhere in Asia have led to light data on the region next week .
While the Government of Italy ignored previous financial commitments to the EU , the rest of the EU would have to quickly determine whether the decision to Italy would be firmly rejected . It did not support the decision , and he wished to abide by the EU rules .
The year when the British Conservative Conservatives will be held in Birmingham may also spark a spark as the UK talks are in a critical stage .

Despite the volatility of global financial markets , the US Foreign Exchange Fund said Monday that the foreign exchange fund ’ s investment earnings of $ 97 % this year were about 97 % , and the foreign stock losses fell sharply in the wake of the US trade war .
According to the latest data , the Foreign Exchange Fund recorded 16 billion dollars in investment revenue from July to September 2018 , which was significantly lower than that of 618 in the same year , but the second quarter of this year .
&apos;At the beginning of the trade war , Hong Kong and emerging markets &apos; stock indices are contrary to the index , and the market sentiment starts to reverse until late September and early October , when investors are becoming aware that the trade war is also detrimental to the United States , &apos; said the president .
&quot; The change in market sentiment is a good thing , and if the trade war is only unilateral , it can help to solve things . &quot;
But he also pointed out that “ a trade war has not been resolved and financial market volatility will rise . ”
In this year , the share of foreign exchange funds in Hong Kong fell between 8 and 47 per cent over the previous quarter , and foreign equity returns rose to $ 128 billion ; foreign exchange losses were 16.1 per cent , bond earnings fell by 24 per cent , and the rate fell by 24 per cent and 31 per cent , mainly reflecting a general rise in the US dollar against the major currencies , and the United States dollar .
Foreign exchange funds are mainly used to support Hong Kong .
Hong Kong has applied the Hong Kong dollar system to the United States dollar since 1983 .
With regard to the current financial situation in Hong Kong , it said that the economic and asset market uncertainty increased and the downside risks increased , but the Hong Kong financial system was robust and defensed .
&quot; Hong Kong &apos;s international investment position is well enough to amount to $ 1.4 trillion in foreign capital , which is more than 4 times GDP , more than 2.5 times in Singapore and 0.6 times in Japan , to cope with the downturn or reverse enough . &quot;
The recent decline in the Hong Kong dollar and the expansion of the dollar spreads , according to which , on 21 September , the Hong Kong dollar had risen to more than 400 basis points , and the market was widely seen as having been linked to the rise in Hong Kong dollars , followed by a continued decline in the dollar near the United States dollar , which had continued to fall in the wake of the US dollar , which could attract the market and the dollar .
But , he believes , as Hong Kong &apos;s bank interest rates begin to start , the Hong Kong dollar interest rate will change in the future below the dollar rate .
&quot; The Hong Kong dollar interest rate will be more consistent with the dollar interest rate , and everyone needs to be more careful to manage risks and prepare for market volatility . &quot;
As Hong Kong dollar funds were well funded , the Hong Kong dollar fell by 0.9 per cent on Monday , by 0.9 per cent on Monday , and 51 per cent from 46 points to the dollar , with a five-month low from 120 points to 127 points .
From May to September , the Hong Kong dollar spot exchange rate was mostly close to the US $ 1 .
During the period in May and August , it was again triggered in May and August , owing to factors such as the release of funds from the Hong Kong dollar and the resulting outflow of funds from a portion of the stock .
In order to maintain the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate , the Hong Kong dollar purchase of Hong Kong dollar exchange rate was purchased .
In May and August , it bought about 521 million copies in May and August .

At the time of the day , the first half of the day has met the demands of the public for consumer consumption , which , at the same time , is awkward , and the institution has no threshold so far .
According to the National Directorate for Market Control , a national &quot; quality month &quot; event was launched in 2018 , with journalists coming to a five-star group in the city of Tianjin for a certification experience .
The general health centres provide services such as newborn care , feeding , postnatal repair and repair .
In this month &apos;s sub-centre , journalists have observed that nurses regularly check the birth of newborn babies , and that they provide a fine nursing service for newborn babies .
At the same time , in order to meet the needs of new mothers , the early childhood wound care , the provision of medical care care programs such as Chinese medicine treatment and beauty care are provided to help mothers restore the rate .

The head of this month &apos;s sub-centre said that they were the only one in all five-star centres in Tianjin , the only one being certified by a level B service .
&quot; While some clients initially do not understand the meaning of the level B certification , it is important for the long-term development of the enterprise to benefit from the strict standardization of process management by certification companies , &quot; he said .
It is an important part of the national quality infrastructure that service certification is based on customer perception , attention to organizational quality management and service characteristics satisfaction , and is an important part of the national quality infrastructure .

In Hong Kong , Hong Kong , on November 5 , a second consecutive month after the arrival of Hong Kong , China ’ s president said the current fashion needed time to watch whether the housing market had entered a downward cycle , and if it was confirmed , it would be possible to consider tightening the tightening policy at due time .
It is said that if a callback is rebuffed , it will be the first time that the impact will be on the market at the peak of the housing market , but it is expected that there is much less chance of selling property in the 1997 Asian financial crisis .
In order to confirm that the housing market is entering a downward cycle , it may be appropriate to relax when it is confirmed that the housing market is going to fall .
&quot; But there is only a few weeks of data , and it &apos;s more time to relax it , and still more time to see whether the housing market enters the downward cycle . &quot;
Since the beginning of 2009 , China has introduced counter-cyclical measures to significantly tighten mortgages in all kinds of property , including lowering mortgage loans and mortgage applicants to improve bank risk management and resilience .
As Hong Kong officially entered the interest-rate cycle , the Hong Kong private housing net index fell to a peak for two consecutive months in August – September , with a monthly decline in September to 18.5 % .
But this year &apos;s cumulative increase of 10.2 % .
In the second quarter of this year , the number of households with no mortgage in Hong Kong has reached 66 % , compared with the average of 60 % in 2009 - 11 , and the rate of the new mortgage rate , which is 47 % and 34 % , compared with 64 % and 34 % , respectively , in the second quarter .

It is considered &quot; incurable &quot; in the past as a chronic disease of multiple organs of the body .
Because of the unknown mechanism of pathogenesis , the problem of diagnosis , the lack of effective treatment methods cannot cure .

Are lawyers holding the court at the court ?
The news was really exciting , and it was in the legal circle .
The law of Fujian , Fujian Province , then fined the lawyer &apos;s lawyer 500 yuan , and in writing recommended the investigation of the Bar Association .
According to the new Ministry of Public Information , a formal notification of the conduct of the two lawyers is not punishable by law .
As a result of multi-story reports , the treatment of the Aberas is not a problem or confrontation , but it has been endorsed by the Glenan .
Together , it was possible to trigger tension within the legal community and eventually be properly resolved .
The reversal of the matter stems from a more complete truth reduction : the axe carrying an axe with the accused with the same pattern , as well as in the form , but not on the basis of the proof of proof , without intimidation or &quot; endangering court security &quot; .
There are four very important details to judge whether the conduct of a lawyer is illegal : first , the local court has tried two times before the local court , showing only the axes of the axe ; and , in the case of the defence , not to seek a judge &apos;s consent , but not to seek a judge &apos;s consent .
In the light of these circumstances , it can be seen that the lawyer &apos;s &quot; appearance before the court &quot; is not relevant .
After the fact that the whole facts were to be clarified , it was a decision to hold the pressure against the pressure .
And that decision also stood up to the facts and laws .
As for the transfer of an axe to the court as a tool of control without the permission of the court , it is indeed easy to cause confusion and misunderstanding .
For security and careful consideration , the previous penalty penalty and judicial advice were not well received .
In order to safeguard the dignity of a lawyer , to prevent the individual court &apos;s counsel , the Supreme Court issued the Rules for Security Safety Security of the People &apos;s Courts in 2014 and established the principle of the physical safety of lawyers .
Since the issuance of the rule , a wide range of lawyers have been guided by the fact that there are few incidents that endanger the security of the Tribunal .
It is difficult to eliminate misconceptions in such a way as to communicate with each other in a spirit of mutual respect and understanding .
As a self-discipline organization in the profession of lawyers , the Bar Association carries out a dual mission of discipline and guarantees lawful .
In the past , individual organizations have been criticized for their emphasis on discipline and security .
The decision to do so , from both the process and the outcome , is commendable , and provides an example for the right work of the better .
What are the good things that will affect us from 1 October ?

Positive 2 : The low tax rate is significantly larger
The new tax scale will be applied as of 1 October , in addition to the improvement of the network .
The rate of salary , salary income and the previous agreement had not changed , but the tax rate had changed markedly , with 3 % , 10 % , 20 % lower rates , and 25 % , 35 % , 45 % , and 45 % .
It is worth noting that the tax law has also adjusted the tax rate for production operations , with the floor at the top of 35 per cent from $ 100,000 to $ 500,000 .
This means that both the individual and the partnership enterprise will benefit from the business .

Since the mid-2000s , with China &apos;s growth in demand for demand , the US farmer Paul Thomas planted a growing number of soybeans in his field .
This shift has reached the highest level this year , and he has an unprecedented amount of 1,600 acres of soybeans in 5,000 acres .
But Thomas and many farmers , like him , plan to take the staple crop in the former US agricultural area in the next year : corn and wheat .
American farmers have grown more than maize this year , for the first time since 35 years .
It is planned to transfer other food crops because US farmers are facing difficulties in selling soybeans in the context of US President Donald Bush &apos;s trade war against China .
China usually buys about 60 per cent of the US export soybeans , but as a result of trade wars , almost zero purchases of US soybeans in recent months have fallen to a decade .
Thomas intends to grow more wheat next year and hopes to make some gains by reducing its reliance on crops that demand China .
Thomas said it was &quot; a painful blow to us &quot; .
He said there was no need for China to buy , and the price of soybean spot in the vicinity of its farm was $ 7.10 per kilo , and the cost of covering the cost was US $ 0.75 .
American farmers have reached record highs this year , and harvest is expected to record a record record .
In such a very vulnerable moment , they were hit by a trade war .
China imports import tariffs on imports of US soybeans in July against his tariffs on imported Chinese goods .
The United States Department of Agriculture will issue its first forecast report for next year &apos;s planting area , which will include consideration of tariffs .
It is expected that the estimate will confirm the expectations of civil institutions to reduce soybeans .
According to a report from Reuters on 19 October , it is expected that the area of maize cultivation will increase by 4 per cent to 92.7 million acres ( 37.5 million hectares ) and that the area of soybean cultivation will decrease by between 7 and 8 million acres .
It is also expected that US wheat cultivation will increase by 4 % .
The soybean area planted before the retaliatory tariffs increased to 89.6 million acres this year , about 15 million acres above 10 years ago .
The area of maize cultivation has increased by less than 5 million acres since 2008 to 89.1 million acres , and this year the area of wheat cultivation is 47.8 million acres , close to the lowest level of 100 years .
This year , nearly half of his country &apos;s total cultivated area is about 3,600 acres , and nearly half of this year is used to grow soybeans .
He said it was possible to increase maize cultivation by a maximum of 20 % in his farm in northern Illinois ; the state was the largest soybean cultivation state in the United States .
Soybean is less than corn per hectare , but less fertilizer is needed , which makes it a low planting cost .
If the farmer is transferred to corn corn , it may increase the cost , but it will benefit some of the enterprises , including the AOC Inc .
&apos;He expects that the transfer of corn would facilitate fertilizer use , &apos; said the Executive Director .
It is also expected to benefit from the transfer of maize by farmers .

The fifth &quot; Voice of Disability &quot; to focus on sexual education for adolescents with disabilities
In recent years , the topic of sex education for adolescents in China has been widely discussed , but the challenge is still daunting for adolescents with disabilities .
Recently , a seminar on comprehensive educational challenges and practical strategies for disabled people was held in Beijing .
How to introduce sexual education to young people is an important topic of this seminar .
The report on the Sexual Related Knowledge , attitudes and Conduct of Young People and Youth , published at the meeting , shows that the proportion of sexual harassment and sexual abuse is higher than that of healthy children .

On the evening of 20 September this year , Mr. Joe , who read in Zhengzhou in Zhengzhou , drove to the house .

Repeated incidents of events have led to the realization of the need to be deterred and even punished on the spot .
This requires that our trains be brave enough to take strong measures in a timely manner , and that no train should be deployed as soon as possible to preserve a timely halt to and combat violations .

Strict punishment is not the reason to be the cause of a commodity , and the relevant departments should have clear responsibilities , the primary regulatory forces fall down , and which points to be held out of question , and to be held accountable .
The market market access is subject to strict qualification review , the market circulation of the market , so that the products are positive , clear and clear , from the source and the source , to make the legitimate business safe to operate .
Activation of rural consumption to guide healthy consumption needs .
