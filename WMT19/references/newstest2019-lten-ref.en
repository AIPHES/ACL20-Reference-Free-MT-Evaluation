Custodians of ethics: The Board of the Liberal Movement is right about the action of the Vilnius branch
“Decisions taken by the Board are in line with the Articles of Association,” Vytautas Tamošiūnas, the head of the Commission, said to BNS after the Commission meeting.
“That decision of ours was not something new.
We, as the Commission, gave our explanation already in July, when the issue about Pagėgiai and Utena had come up.
We said then that according to the Articles of Association, this issue is within the competence of the Board.
And if the Board decides that a particular branch can behave as it wishes - to run with a committee, and the Board approves of that, then that branch can run so, but if the Board decides that the party will run everywhere with party lists, which is what the Board has decided, then it is a decision for all branches to form party lists.
And if someone does not agree with the Board, then there is a possibility to suspend membership and run with a committee," he added.
According to V. Tamošiūnas, now the Board of the party is to decide on its further course of action.
On 17 October, the Board of the political party Liberal Movement cancelled the decision of the Vilnius city branch to participate in the municipal elections not with a party list, but with a list of an elections committee, which is currently being formed.
In the opinion of the Board of the party, the decision of the liberals in the capital city to participate in the elections in the form of a public elections committee is in breach of the Articles of Association of the party, decisions of the Board.
The Vilnius branch was to waive its intentions to participate in the municipal elections with a committee list by 31 October.
However, the branch failed to do that.
Aušrinė Armonaitė, former head of the branch, a member of the Seimas, has already left the Liberal Movement.
The Mayor of Vilnius, Remigijus Šimašius, former chairman of the Liberal Movement, who intends to run for the second term as the Mayor of Vilnius, has already introduced the team and ideas of the public elections committee “For Vilnius we are proud of!”.
He also has left the party.
Elections for municipal councils and offices of mayors will be held in March next year.
Residents of a North Indian village used a tractor to crush a tigress, who had torn up a man, the officers reported on Monday.
Forest officer Mahavir Kaujlagi said villagers circled the female tiger after it killed a man working in the fields late Sunday, and when the tiger tried to escape, the villagers crushed it under the wheels of a tractor.
Villagers said the tiger had injured another young man in an attack about 10 days ago.
The village is inside the Dudhwa Tiger Reserve in Lakhimpur Khiri area, approximately 250 kilometers southeast of Lucknow, the state capital of Uttar Pradesh.
Killing a tiger in protected areas is illegal.
The reserve’s director Ramesh Pandey said that the case in question would be reported to the police under the Wildlife Protection Act .
In April, villagers had beaten up another tiger in Nighasan area of the state of Uttar Pradesh; it suffered severe injuries.
The tiger is India's national animal; it is categorized as endangered species under the Wildlife Protection Act.
Last year’s government data show that, in the last three years, at least one person was killed per day in confrontations with wild tigers or elephants.
The human conflicts with tigers has gradually increased since the 8th decade, when India started a tiger conservation program that carved out sanctuaries in national parks, and made it a crime to kill a big cat.
Though methods for counting tigers have changed, a census suggests the population of about 1,800 tigers then grew to 2,226 in 2014.
It is proposed to mark cats and dogs with microchips mandatorily
Kęstutis Mažeika, the Chairman of the Seimas Committee on Environmental Protection, and other members of the Seimas registered draft amendments to the Law on the Welfare and Protection of Animals, proposing to mark cats and dogs with subcutaneous microchips under the mandatory procedure.
“We propose that cats and dogs would have to be marked with subcutaneous microchips, and their registration and marking would be organized by local municipalities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service.
In 2019 marking of all dogs, in 2020 also of all cats would be funded by the state, therefore, people would not have problems and the costs would be covered from special state financial assignments,” said Kęstutis Mažeika, the Chairman of the Seimas Committee on Environmental Protection.
The amendments to the Law are aimed at dealing with the need of systemic marking of pets.
It is expected that it will help to avoid problems caused by irresponsible pet owners, illegal breeders or sellers.
It is preliminarily assessed that based on the average price of the chip and the chip implantation service, which will be about EUR 5, all pet owners will be compensated during the transitional period.
The total price of marking all pets can amount up to EUR 6 million.
It is planned that the use of the funds will span over the period of three years and will amount to EUR 2 million per year.
It is expected that the funds for the marking programs will be assigned through the Special Program of the Municipalities for Supporting Environmental Protection, the income of which will grow significantly this year due to increase in taxes on natural resources and redistribution of funds.
Municipalities will be able to use these funds not only for marking of cats and dogs, but also for castration and other programs.
According to K. Mažeika, the mandatory marking is practiced in almost all Member States of the European Union, that also allows protecting pets (as lost pets can be easily returned to their owners), and saves pet owners’ time as they usually need much time and money in search for a runaway and lost pet.
Besides, the EU legal acts say that one can travel only with marked pets.
Marking also obligates the owner to take care of the pet responsibly throughout its life.
Previous proposals to impose mandatory marking were objected to, as it was proposed to finance relevant programs with people’s money.
“The current model should be spared this criticism, as it is proposed to finance pet protection with increased income in the program for supporting environmental protection and to give the right to do the marking not only to veterinarians but also to public activists, i.e. persons in animal shelters who have taken special courses in the Veterinary Academy," the authors of the draft say.
The draft law has been registered by a group of members of the Seimas representing various factions in the Seimas: Kęstutis Mažeika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenijus Gentvilas, Edmundas Pupinis, Rimas Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.

Rytas to help a Ukrainian club
On Wednesday, a match of the fourth round of the FIBA Europe Cup will take place in the arena of Vilnius Rytas, where the clubs of Kosovo and Ukraine will compete.
The match is organized in Vilnius for political reasons.
Vilnius Rytas, which has warm relationship with Ukrainian basketball, will host Cherkaski Mavpy (from Cherkasy) and KB Prishtina (from Pristina) teams in Rytas arena on 7 November.
“Due to political relationship between Kosovo and Ukraine, we were unable to organize this match at home, therefore, we are very glad that our friends from Vilnius agreed to accept us,” Maxim Michelson, the chief coach of the Ukrainian team, thanked Rytas.
“We have a lot of friends in Vilnius, our countries have always been on good terms.
Lithuania is one of the countries with the best basketball traditions in the world, therefore, it will be an honor for us to play here.
We hope Vilnius people will be our fans.”
The Kosovo team could not come to Ukraine as these countries do not have any diplomatic relationship.

Then the Ukrainian team won 100:61.
Basketball fans will have free admission to the match on Wednesday, the match starts at 19:00.
Actress B. Arsobaitė starring in “Women are better liars” is being persecuted by liars
It is most probably only a coincidence, but the glamorous brown-eyed actress Brigita Arsobaitė keeps getting roles related to liars.
At first it was TV series "Women are better liars", then the play “Women liars” and, finally, the comedy movie “Liars”.
In this movie, Brigita plays a petulant wife of the character played by Dainius Kazlauskas.
"I really liked playing in the movie “Liars”, but I am a theater actress more and rarely appear in movies.
A wonderful team of colleagues promised a great result from the very outset.
This experience is very important and valuable for me.
But the most interesting thing that happened on the shooting set was the puppy Sunny!
All my life I believed that if I had a dog, it would really be big and solemn.
I have never had a crush on those little, ornamental doggies of silly blondes.
But during shooting Sunny got so attached to me that the sympathy has become mutual and finally I even wanted to buy it from its owner, but unsuccessfully,” the actor smiled.
The new Lithuanian comedy “Liars” produced by Paulius Virbickas, the producer of the Lithuanian movie hits “Inexperienced” and “Speaking among us, boys...”, and by producers Stasys Baltakis and Vladimiras Razarionovas, gets the viewers involved into comic and intriguing family peripeteias already from the first minutes of the movie.
Your beloved has just informed you that she is pregnant.
It would be a wonderful news, but... your beloved is your brother’s wife!
But that is not everything.
Before announcing “the goods news” to everybody, the parents suddenly declare that they are having a divorce!
After 50 years together...
And all this happens right before the greatest holiday of the year - Christmas!
But the ending will surprise you even more as it was totally unexpected.
All the characters are not such as they looked at first sight...
Beside B. Arsobaitė, cinema stars of even four generations will make viewers of the comedy movie “Liars” laugh: Giedrius Savickas, Dainius Kazlauskas, Edita Užaitė, Giedrė Giedraitytė, Liubomiras Laucevičius, Larisa Kalpokaitė and Gediminas Girdvainis.
Watch the comedy “Liars” in cinemas from 9 November.
Decision on whether to write off EUR 100 million of overdue emigrants’ taxes is to be taken
On Tuesday, the Seimas accepted an amendment to the Law on Declaration of the Place of Residence proposed by Ramūnas Karbauskis, the leader of the “farmers” party, for consideration.
56 members of the Seimas voted in favor of it, 9 - against, and 25 abstained.
The Seimas will continue consideration of the amendments on 6 December or later, after it gets an opinion from the Government.
R. Karbauskis says that these payments accrue for people who did not declare their departure from Lithuania.
According to the member of the Seimas, one person fails to pay about EUR 1,000 of taxes in a period of three years, and currently the number of such persons is about 100,000.
A social-democrat Algirdas Sysas feared that in this way the Seimas “will encourage some people to defy their duties” by declaring departure and then no taxes would be charged.
A conservative Antanas Matulas, member of the Committee of Health Affairs, noted that Lithuanians, who live abroad, abuse the situation as, paying a small health insurance tax, they come to Lithuania for medical treatment and receive the same services as the residents who pay this tax.
The amendments provide that those persons, who pay social insurance contributions in the Member States of the European Union, the European Economic Area or in the Swiss Confederation, and are released by Sodra from the duty to pay health insurance contributions in Lithuania, would be considered as having departed from Lithuania.
Mindaugas Sinkevičius, the head of Sodra, noted previously that such a step will make both the life of emigrants and the operations of Sodra easier.
A video of a slipping baby bear, that has become viral online, reveals a serious problem
It has been filmed how a mother bear climbs a steep snow-covered slope, while her cub keeps climbing, sliding down and again persistently climbing.
The video had many reviews and comments.
People admired the little bear’s persistency - having slipped multiple times, it used to resume its journey towards its mother.
It does not succeed at first, but the cub does not even try to give up and finally reaches its goal.
The video really captures attention but it also reveals the danger people cause for animals.
Scientists say that one has also to speak that people’s wish to get to know wildlife sometimes can be harmful.
“It is obvious to me that the drone scared the bears greatly.
Their movements show that they panic.
If there had been no drone flying around, they would have probably chosen a safer way or would have taken it slower or with more caution.
It is a perfect example of how drones should not be used,” the ecologist Mark Ditmer said to the publication “The Verge”.
Some time ago, M. Ditmer and his colleagues researched how drones were affecting bears.
Heart monitors were placed on the animals.
When a drone used to come close, some bears started running, while others did not, but the hearts of all of them were pounding with fear.
Scientists advise to use drones for filming animals in a responsible manner, not to fly too close, not to cause noise and not to fly where that is forbidden.
Addressing the runaway President in a newspaper
On Tuesday, Kiev court invited the overturned President Viktor Yanukovych, who fled to Russia, to arrive to a hearing of the case, where he is suspected of high treason, in an unusual manner - the summons were published in the official publication of the state.
The court summons, published in the government news gazette Uriadovy Kurier, calls the former leader to arrive to a hearing in the criminal proceedings on 19 November, during which his final arguments could be heard.
The document indicates that V. Yanukovych has the right to take part in the hearing by way of a video conference.
On 30 October, the Kiev court announced having finished debates in V. Yanukovych’s case.
V. Yanukovych’s advocate Aleksandr Goroshinskiy, working in Russia, was given an opportunity to register in the register of foreign advocates by 19 November in order to be able to participate in the hearing where V. Yanukovych, as it is expected, would say his final word by use of video conference.
V. Yanukovych, supported by the Kremlin, was overturned and fled to Russia during the Maidan insurrection in February 2014, which had been provoked by the President’s refusal to sign the Association Agreement with the European Union.
The Russian President Vladimir Putin later revealed that the former leader of Ukraine was taken to Russia during a special operation organized by Moscow.
In March that year, Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula that belonged to Ukraine, and some time later a war started in the East of the country between Kiev and separatists supported by Russia.
Since then, the battles took lives of about 10,000 people in spite of multiple attempts of the international community to ensure long-term truce.
In the elections for the Council of Vilnius, the list of the conservatives will be headed by Valdas Benkunskas
Dainius Kreivys, former Minister of Economy, a member of the Seimas, has already previously been approved as the candidate of the conservatives for the office of the Mayor.
On the weekend, during the preliminary elections of the conservatives, members of the party rated candidates on the list for the Council of Vilnius City Municipality.
The party reports that V. Benkunskas, chairman of the meeting of Vilnius divisions of the Homeland Union – Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD), has become the leader of the conservatives’ list.
The first ten candidates on the list are current members of the Council of Vilnius City Municipality Paulė Kuzmickienė, Adomas Bužinskas, Gediminas Švilpa, Audrius Skaistys, Rasa Baškienė, former member of the Seimas Liutauras Kazlavickas, Chairman of the Young Conservatives’ League Mantas Benkunskas, Arūnas Valinskas and Goda Karazijaitė.
Direct elections for offices of mayors and municipal councils will be held in Lithuania on 3 March next year.
Restrictions on cogeneration power plants appealed before the Constitutional Court
The Seimas opposition, as promised, appealed against the decision of the ruling parties to pass the law on a possibility to stop construction of waste-to-energy plants before the Constitutional Court (CC).
On Tuesday, the Seimas opposition faction of the Homeland Union – Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) notified that a group of members of the Seimas addressed the CC with an application for investigating whether the amendments to the Law on Waste Management adopted by the ruling parties are in line with the Constitution.
“The members of the Seimas emphasize that provisions of the law aim to challenge the currently ongoing projects of waste incineration facilities, instructing the Government to impose new restrictions (20 km distance to a residential territory) on waste-to-energy plants that started to be constructed in Vilnius and Kaunas before the effective date of the law,” the notification says.
It adds that “the members of the Seimas note that taking into account how the law words the prohibition to construct waste management objects of national importance (i.e. determines a distance and defines the concept of “residential territory”), a conclusion is to be made that this prohibition disproportionately restricts or even denies the very essence of the right to perform economic activities related to burning of waste to produce energy, as the established criteria are worded so that, having in mind the population density and distribution in Lithuania, construction of such objects would be practically impossible in the whole territory of the country”.
The application says that the adopted law is contrary to the constitutional principle of the rule of law.
“The CC has indicated for a number of times that legal acts do not apply to those legal facts and consequences that occurred before the effective date of a newly adopted legal act.
In this case, the Government is given powers to apply the law retroactively, following an indefinite criterion.
Imposing such legal regulation violates the constitution principles of legal certainty, legal safety, protection of legitimate expectations, consequently, the constitutional principle of the rule of law,” the application indicates.
It also notes that big financial investments have already been made to the projects of Vilnius and Kaunas cogeneration power plants.
Stopping of the currently ongoing projects would inflict a financial loss of hundreds of millions on the State, the Lithuanian population would suffer huge losses, too - heating prices would increase, the growing volumes of waste in dumpsites would result in increased environmental pollution.
The application to the CC has been signed by members from Seimas TS-LKD, Liberal Movement, Social Democratic factions and by Algirdas Butkevičius, deputy head of a ruling Social Democratic Labor faction.
A couple of weeks ago, the Seimas gave 71 votes, mostly from the ruling parties, in order to reject the veto of the President Dalia Grybauskaitė on the adopted amendments to the Law on Waste Management, providing for the right of the Government to stop already started construction of cogeneration power plants, also set a buffer zone of 20 km from residential locations for construction of such power plants.
The amendments to the law repeated adopted by the Seimas will come into force on 1 January 2019. By the way, the ruling parties already propose to drop the 20 km restriction.
It is planned to consider this proposal already in the autumn session of the Seimas.
But the Seimas does not plan to cancel the right of the Government to stop already started projects.
The CC will examine the case in the order of sequence, which is a year later at the earliest.
LeBron James’ stats in Lakers club, which raises concerns, revealed
The start of LeBron James’ career in Los Angeles Lakers club is not as expected by him himself, the team and basketball fans.
Lakers started the season with four wins and six losses, and such a weak start resulted in rumors that the coach Luke Walton can be fired.
Still, such talks were silenced by Magic Johnson, the President of Basketball Operations, who declared the coach would not be fired, but better play is expected.
The biggest star of the team L. James should have a look at himself, too.
The player’s stats is impressive as usual, though - 26.8 points, 7.6 rebounds and 7.7 assists.
But that is not the whole truth.
During the first ten matches of the season, other figures came up, showing that Lakers play better when L. James is not on the court.
+/- stats, showing the difference in points scored or missed by the team when certain players are on the court, is not favorable for the player.
When L. James was on the ground this season, Lakers missed 30 points more than their opponents.
Meanwhile, when he was on the bench, Lakers scored 19 points more than their opponents.
Currently, Lakers have just the 13th standing in the Western Conference, but several wins can change everything.
Spain will continue contributing to protection of the Lithuanian air space
It was noted in the meeting that Spain would contribute to protection of air space in Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 2019 and 2020.
“Lithuania very much appreciates the Span’s cooperation within the NATO framework and its significant contribution in ensuring security of our country and the region,” said the Minister L. Linkevičius.

Jose Maria Robles Fraga presented his letters of credence to the President Dalia Grybauskaitė on 29 October.
V. Ačienė about detention of R. Ačas: I believe my husband is innocent and I believe in law enforcement
"That was the most unexpected thing to me that I could never think of.
On the other hand, the authorities probably are just doing their job.
Each of us are doing our job.
I believe in law enforcement authorities, I believe my husband, that everything is just and fair, that he has not taken any unfair actions,” V. Ačienė told BNS.
R. Ačas was detained by the Special Investigation Service (SIS) on Monday - the law enforcement authorities suspect that he, while being the Director of the Administration of the Raseiniai Municipality, took a bribe of big value, and in exchange he could have created exceptional conditions for a private company that signed a contract with the Raseiniai bus fleet controlled by the municipality.
It is suspected that representatives of private companies directly paid off R. Ačas or were involved in disguising bribes as various financial operations.
In April this year, the Council of the Raseiniai District Municipality dismissed R. Ačas from the office of the head of the Administration at the third attempt after a statement of distrust in him had been made.
In March this year, a former member of the Order and Justice became a member of the newly founded Social Democratic Labor Party of Lithuania headed by Gediminas Kirkilas, he suspended his membership in this political party on Monday.
R. Ačas unsuccessfully ran for the office of the mayor as a representative of the electoral committee “Tavo Raseiniai” several years ago.
V. Ačienė says that her husband was not going to run for the Raseiniai mayor next year, but he has not decided yet on participation in the elections for the municipal councils.
V. Ačienė was elected to the Seimas on the list of the Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union, she is a member of the Seimas Anticorruption Commission.
The politician said she would wait for further actions of the law enforcement authorities - her decision on removing herself from the work in the Commission would depend on them.
"I am really not taking any fast decisions today, I will make up my mind this week, I think.
I will see, if it becomes necessary, depending on the type of accusations, it is clear that I will have to take some decision.
It is probably necessary that I would stay away from all those matters investigated in the Anticorruption Commission, but again - time will reveal the truth,” she spoke.
Radvilė Morkūnaitė-Mikulėnienė, a representative of the conservatives in opposition in the Seimas, urged the Speaker of the Seimas Viktoras Pranckietis and the leader of the “farmers’” party Ramūnas Karbauskis to dissociate from statements of the faction colleague Vida Ačienė and to remove her from the Seimas Anticorruption Commission, transferring her to another Seimas committee or commission.
She says that further work of V. Ačienė in the Seimas Anticorruption Commission "would cause grounded lack of trust in the society and would discredit the work of the important parliamentary supervisory commission".

Palestinian, having attacked Israelis with a knife, shot in West Bank
A soldier “prevented this attack as he identified a terrorist, who tried to knife civilians and an IDF (Israel Defense Forces) officer”, says the report released by the Israeli army about the incident by Kiryat Arba settlement on the outskirts of Hebron.
“The soldier opened fire at the terrorist and neutralized him.
He was taken to the hospital.
Israeli civilians and IDF solders were not injured,” the report adds.
The army press representative said to the news agency AFP that the attack was attempted by a Palestinian.
The video material shot after the incident reveals that his injuries were not severe.
A wave of similar attacks by Palestinians started in 2015.
The number of such attacks has declined in recent years, however it is feared that a new wave may start.
On 22 October, a Palestinian who attacked a group of Jewish soldiers with a knife near Hebron, was shot dead.
Grybauskaitė urges China to create a more favorable investment environment for the EU business
The President Dalia Grybauskaitė invites China to create a more favorable investment environment for the European Union (EU) investments, to ease conditions for foreign import.
In the Chinese import exhibition in Shanghai, while opening the trade and investment forum, D. Grybauskaitė accentuated that witnessing signs of slowdown in economy, the common goal of Europe and China should be “to unite efforts to stop spreading of protectionism in the world”, aiming at essential reasons of the tension caused by trade wars, “overproduction and unfair competition”.
“The commitment of China to create a more attractive, open environment for investments is very important for the European Union - it is important in negotiating for a trade agreement with China.
It is important to finalize this trade agreement as soon as possible, ensuring that foreign business would feel welcome and secure here, also by way of strengthening intellectual property protection,” said D. Grybauskaitė.
According to her, opening of China is important not only for Europe, but also for China, as well as for the global economic growth.
The Lithuanian leader emphasized that investment transparency must be “above interests of any business group”.
"Transparency, supremacy of laws, strict adherence to international agreements - that must be essential for the environment of new investment relationships,” D. Grybauskaitė underlined.
“Corrupted capital flows should not be welcome in any country of the world - not only here or in our countries,” she added.
By hosting the import exhibition, China attempts to mitigate the criticism that it avoids opening its market and protects only its own companies.
Leaders of a number of countries participate in the exhibition, over 2,800 companies from 130 countries and regions in the world, including Lithuania.
According to the Lithuanian Department of Statistics, currently China is the 25th among export partners.
Last year, the export of Lithuania to China grew by 50 percent - this amounted to EUR 180 million.
Meanwhile, the volume of import from China exceeded EUR 820 million.
Some officials are concerned that Chinese investments in Lithuania can bring undesired political influence, and the peculiar attention of Beijing to the Eastern Europe undermines the EU unity.

The cause of Lion Air plane crash revealed: relatives of the victims are furious
Data from a black box retrieved from the crashed plane of the Indonesian airlines Lion Air has revealed the aircraft experienced problems with its speed indicator on at least four of its last flights, investigators reported on Monday.
The head of Indonesia’s National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT) Soerjanto Tjahjono told that the plane had suffered similar problems on its last four flights, including the fatal one, when on 29 October the plane plunged into the Java Sea soon after the take-off in Djakarta.
The disaster killed all 189 people on board.
Many of the mass media reported problems during the previous flight of Boeing 737 MAX 8 from Denpasar to the capital city of Indonesia.
“When we opened the black box, yes indeed the technical problem was the airspeed or, in other words, the speed of the plane,” S. Tjahjono said in the press conference.
“Data from the black box showed that the two flights before Denpasar-Jakarta also experienced the same problem,” he added.
“There have been lots of rumors on social media.
Now, we want to explain that in the black box there were (data remaining) about four flights that experienced problems with the airspeed indicator,” the head of KNKT indicated.
During a meeting with victims’ family members, S. Tjahjono said that information of the flight data recorder was consistent with reports that after the plane took off for its last flight, its speed and altitude were erratic.
The searchers have not found the second black box yet, which records the talks in the pilots’ cockpit.
Lion Air indicated that after a technical failure was identified during the flight from Bali to Djakarta, it was repaired as per manafacturer’s recommendations.
Rusdi Kirana, a co-founder of the company, was not invited to speak by the Minister of Transport Budi Karyos Sumadi, who moderated the meeting between relatives and the officials who are overseeing the effort of search for the plane and victim remains and the accident investigation.
But he stood and bowed his head after angry and distraught family members demanded that R. Kirana, who with his brother Kusnan founded Lion Air in 1999, identify himself.
“Lion Air has failed,” said a man who introduced himself as the father of passenger Shandy Johan Ramadhan, who had been a prosecutor in the island, where the plane would have landed.
“I want Mr. Rusdi Kirana and his team to pay attention,” he stressed.
- Since the time of the crisis, I was never contacted by Lion Air.
We lost our child, but Lion Air has not shown any empathy to us.”
After the meeting, R. Kirana left in a hurry, avoiding questions from reporters.
Many families are waiting for results of the long process of identifying victims.
Police medical experts have received nearly 140 bodybags of human remains.
Only 14 victims have been identified so far.
The families have been asking why the two-month-old plane was given flight clearance at all, given that there was a failure reported on a flight from Bali to Jakarta on 28 October, where it descended rapidly right after the take-off, much to the terror of passengers on board.
“Lion Air said that this fault was fixed.
Is it true the problem was cleared?” a son of a victim asked.
- If not, technicians in charge must be held responsible.
The law is absolute because they have stated that the plane was cleared to take off again.
These bad technicians must be processed by law to prevent plane accidents from continuing in Indonesia.”
S. Tjahjono said the large amount of small debris and the fact that debris was found in a relatively small area indicate that the plane probably hit the water at a very high speed.
“The plane was intact when it plunged to the sea.
It did not explode in the air, and the aircraft engine was running at high RPM when it touched the water - it's marked by the loss of all the blades of the turbine,” the official explained.
The Lion Air crash is the worst airline disaster in Indonesia since 1997, when 234 people died on a Garuda flight near Medan.
Rescuers came to help to extract people from crashed cars: a minor among the victims
On Monday evening, two cars - BMW and Mercedes-Benz - collided on the road Vėžaičiai - Plungė, near Tilvikai.
The cars had a head-on collision, three victims were reported.
It has been reported that BMW driver, woman born in 1999, went to the opposite lane and had a head-on collision with Mercedes-Benz, which had a father, born in 1967, and a daughter, born in 2005.
BMW driver had to be extracted from the crushed car by fire rescuers.
The girl from Mercedes-Benz lost her teeth in the accident.
All the victims were taken to the hospital.
President’s Office: no artificial easing regarding referendums is necessary
If the Seimas approves of the proposal of those in power to lower the referendum threshold for Chapter I of the Constitution, which is currently subject to stronger protection, the President would veto the amendments, her advisor Mindaugas Lingė says.
“More than a half of the population voted for the Constitution - such is the requirement.
Therefore, its amendment, particularly of the articles in its Chapter I, should be subject to no less majority vote.
It can be easily predicted that the President would really veto it," internal policy advisor to Dalia Grybauskaitė said to Žinių radijas on Tuesday.
He emphasized that Chapter One of the Constitution defines fundamental matters of the state - the language, the flag, the territory, the capital city, the sovereignty of the state, therefore, if the number of votes necessary to amend these articles were reduced, this, according to M. Lingė, would create a "negative precedent" and "would open a way for uncontrollable risk".
"In the opinion of the President, no artificial easing is necessary, rather more efforts should be used to get ready for the very referendum, there should be more dialogue with people,” he was trying to convince.
On Tuesday, the Seimas is to vote on adoption of an amendment to the Law on Referendum.
It provides that a decision on amendments to Chapter One and Chapter Fourteen of the Constitution, which enjoy a higher level of protection, is to be taken if it is supported by at least two fifths of the citizens having the right to vote in a referendum.
Currently, articles of Chapter One and Chapter Fourteen of the Constitution can be amended by way of a referendum if voted in favor of by more than a half of all the citizens having the voting right.
The right to vote in Lithuania is vested in about 2.5 million citizens: the half would mean 1.25 million voters, two fifths - one million voters.
The proposal was made after in September the Seimas approved the President’s veto regarding amendments previously adopted by the Seimas, which mitigated requirements regarding the number of votes necessary to amend Article 12 of Chapter One of the Constitution that defines citizenship.
It is proposed to lower the referendum threshold in getting ready for the referendum regarding double citizenship, which should be held on 12 May and 26 May next year, when the first and second rounds of the presidential elections are planned.
Currently, save for certain exceptions, emigrants, who emigrated after the restoration of independence on 11 March 1990, cannot have a double citizenship.
The double citizenship is sought by the global Lithuanian community, but initiators are afraid that under current conditions the referendum would fail - the turnout would be insufficient.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanian airports are inadequate, therefore need to be renovated
The Lithuanian airport and road infrastructure starts to be inadequate, therefore, it is necessary to renovate it, says the Minister of Transport and Communications Rokas Masiulis.
According to him, renovation of the Vilnius airport is the minimal target that the State must achieve.
“Air transport infrastructure is already falling behind as it was planned for smaller passenger flows.
We must renovate the Vilnius airport - that is not even a matter of long-term planning, it is the minimum that we must do,” said Mr. Masiulis on Tuesday in the conference on transport and communications organized by the Democracy Development Foundation and the magazine “Valstybė”.
According to the Minister, the next decade will be very important, because important projects will have to be implemented - the construction of Via Baltica, Rail Baltica will have to be completed, the Klaipėda external harbor will have to be built, Vilnius and Kaunas airports will have to be renovated, or maybe a new airport will have to be constructed.
“The next decade will be very important - we have to finish integration of roads, railways, construction of the external harbor in Klaipėda, to manage the airports, probably decide to build a new airport.
It’s not time to sleep, we must start the projects now, which will enable to exploit our potential in 10, 20 or 30 years time,” the Minister of Transport and Communications said.
Mr. Masiulis repeated that too little money had been assigned for maintenance of motor roads in the recent years.
“The condition of roads is not improving yet, as the assignments are not sufficient.
We are able to construct new roads, but there is not enough money even for the most necessary maintenance, for example, of main roads.
We must determine an amount, how much should be assigned for road maintenance if we want the condition of roads to improve,” Mr. Masiulis said.
He emphasized that the export of services in the Lithuanian transport sector has grown 18.6% this year and Germany has become the largest export market, leaving Russia the second.
Mr. Masiulis again criticized the European Commission’s proposal, according to which the carriers of the EU countries will have to periodically return trucks to the country of their registration.
“We must seek that our exporters would feel at home in Western Europe.
In my opinion, the proposal for trucks to keep coming home is absurd as Europe would have empty trucks driving in it, burning fuel and increasing emissions.
The winners in this case are going to be the railways as costs will increase so that some freight will go to railways.
We are looking for ways to defend our position,” Mr. Masiulis said.
According to the Ministry of Transport and Communications, the transport sector creates 12.2% of the
gross domestic product (GDP) of Lithuania.
It employs over 118,000 people in over 7,500 companies.
Dispute with heritage protection authorities
Last week, Mr. Masiulis notified the Seimas Committee on Economics that he had started negotiations for changing the cultural purpose of the Vilnius airport building - that would enable to pull down the old terminal and to build a new one.
But the acting head of the Department of Cultural Heritage (DCH) Algimantas Degutis called Mr. Masiulis’ considerations political pressure.
According to him, the building, which was built in the sixth decade of the last century, is a cultural value entered into the register in 1993, and it is not for politicians, but for specialists to decide on its deletion from the register.
Mr. Masiulis then commented that a modern arrivals terminal would help to improve the image of Lithuania.
“Deletion of the old terminal from the heritage register would be a politically important step in order that we could demolish it and build a new modern arrivals terminal so that upon arrival to Vilnius, travelers could feel themselves in a modern country, rather than in a curiosity place that really does not strike as representing our country as an innovative one,” Mr. Masiulis asserted last week in the Seimas.
Mr. Masiulis then also informed that Kaunas plans to build an absolutely new passenger terminal and connect the airport to the Rail Baltica track, building an underground station.
This transport hub should be put into operation in 2026, when the construction of Rail Baltica is completed.
Last year, the Vilnius airport served about 3.7 million people, this year 4.8 million passengers are expected, next year - 5 million.
The Kaunas airport served 1.2 million passengers in total last year.

Direct flights to Madagascar from Vilnius next year
Next year in spring, the biggest passenger plane Boeing 767 going on regular routes will land in the Vilnius airport and will take travelers from Lithuania directly to the Be island of Madagascar, the portal madeinvilnius.lt writes based on the information from the tour operator Itaka Lietuva.
It is published that passengers of Blue Panorama airlines will be able to choose from 259 economic class and 8 business class seats.
The new vacation destination will be available directly from Lithuania since April 2019.
Dominik Milowski, the CEO of Itaka Lietuva, says that the company seeks to offer new vacation destinations for tourists from Lithuania.
Madagascar is an island in the Indian Ocean, not far from the eastern coast of Africa.
Other tour operators have also prepared new vacation destinations for the summer season of 2019.

Minister of Finance about a possible crisis: it is important not to convince oneself to be sick already
“We must always make preparations for harder times.
I am delighted to say that it is for the first time in the Lithuanian history that we keep accumulating reserves for the third year in a row.
But it is also very important not to convince oneself to be already sick," said V. Šapoka on Monday, during his visit in Brussels.
ELTA reminds that on Monday and Tuesday the Minister of Finance and the Vice-minister Miglė Tuskienė are taking part in meetings of the Eurogroup and the EU Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN) in Brussels.
ECOFIN meeting is to discuss issues related to taxing of digital services.
This new tax is aimed at avoiding fragmentation of the EU single market, as some Member States have already imposed or are going to impose a certain tax on the national level.
In the short term, it is proposed to agree how income received from provision of certain digital services in the EU Member States should be taxed, while there is no global agreement yet.
The Eurogroup will overview draft budgets of the countries in the euro area presented to the European Commission (EC).
On 23 October, the EC rejected the draft budget of Italy as not in line with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.
It is for the first time that the EC makes use of this right given to it.
Belgium, France, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain have been requested to provide more information.
The Eurogroup is also to discuss the Economic and Monetary Union strengthening issues: the European deposit insurance system implementation possibilities and the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) reforms.
Lithuania supports a stronger role of the ESM in financial assistance programs, but it is believed that the ESM functions must be clearly defined in order to avoid repetition of functions of the ESM and other EU institutions.
Balys Buračas.
Lithuanian work traditions and customs
It has been 120 years since the birth of Balys Buračas (1897-1972), famous Lithuanian photographer and chronicler of culture, ethnographer and specialist of regional studies, who was born in Sidariai, Šiaulėnai district, the then Šiauliai governorate.
Commemorating the centenary of the State of Lithuania, we have a perfect occasion to remember how the vivacious national revival called many Lithuanian people, including the Buračai brothers - Balys, Jonas, Bronius - from the very village depths to get involved with all their creative powers into cherishing, preservation and giving sense to our cultural traditions.
Balys Buračas, who travelled the native land for over 50 years with a photo camera in his hands, gave a wide and truthful image of customs, traditions, folk art and tangible culture of our country.
He sought to preserve the rapidly diminishing riches of national culture and had a rare ability to understand the historical value of work he was doing.
Balys Buračas’ photos with Lithuanian scenery, mounds, our people in national costumes in everyday environment and in festivals illustrated pages of Lithuanian papers and magazines.
This publication contains a large part of Balys Buračas’ legacy intended for description of national work customs and related traditions and, what is most important, their attractive iconography.
The published material shows not only the peculiarity and beauty of those traditions, but also the progress of our civilization during the past century in spite of two world wars and oppressive occupation.
The manuscript of the book has ample descriptions written down by Balys Buračas of work, work related festivals and other traditions and customs in Lower Lithuania, especially of Kupiškis, Šiaulėnai, Telšiai people, also of people in Aukštaitija and Dzūkija regions in the period between the two world wars.
Out of about 10,000 remaining negatives kept in museums and archives, over 400 rare photos, most of which have never been published, were selected for this publication, which have been grouped according to chosen texts.
They reflect unique aspects of ethnical culture, characteristic of Kupiškis, Dzūkija people, other districts in Aukštaitija and Žemaitija regions.

Tragic fate of a couple: died just few hours after getting married
The newlyweds, who got married just few hours ago, died in a helicopter crash in the southwest Texas, the USA.
William Troy Byler and his wife Bailee Raye Ackerman Byler, both 24, died on Sunday soon after midnight after the helicopter crashed into a hill 16 km northwest of Uvalde and 129 kilometers west of San Antonio, said Steven Kennedy, local justice of the peace.
It is strange that the crash happened after flying about 24 kilometers, which coincides with the age of the newlyweds.
The 76-year-old helicopter pilot, Gerald Douglas Lawrence, was also killed.
The newlyweds studied at Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas.
They got married on Saturday evening in the Byler family ranch near Uvalde and after the marriage ceremony left aboard a family helicopter.
The crash happened about 24 kilometers from where the helicopter took off.
The flight was to carry the newlyweds to San Antonio International Airport, where they were to board a plane for their honeymoon, said S. Kennedy, who did not indicate the couple’s final destination.
“It's a very rocky, rough terrain and this particular hill has a 120-150 meter rise,” S. Kennedy said.
G.D. Lawrence had been a family’s pilot for many years.
He had also flown helicopters in Vietnam during his service, S. Kennedy said.
An autopsy on the pilot should reveal his physical condition and whether it might have been a factor in the crash.
The helicopter crashed about 5 to 10 minutes after takeoff.
Its wreckage was strewn across the rugged hillside at a wide radius, leaving the main body of the aircraft "hanging perilously," Craig Hatch, an air safety investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), said at a news conference on Monday.
Investigators plan to retrieve the wreckage before performing their close inspection, but it would not be easy for a trailer and a truck to reach the place, he said.
The cause of the crash hasn't been determined, but a preliminary NTSB report should be issued in two weeks.
Prime Minister of Israel calls start of new sanctions for Iran a “historic day”
“Today is a historic day,” B. Netanyahu told lawmakers from his Likud party, according to his office.
“Today is the day when the USA, under the President (Donald) Trump, imposes particularly harsh sanctions on Iran, the harshest sanctions on Iran over the whole time when efforts to tame its aggression started,” said the leader of the Israeli government.
Earlier on Monday, Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman called the new sanctions a “critical” blow to Israel’s actions in the region.
The measures described by Washington as “the toughest sanctions ever” follow D. Trump’s controversial decision made in May to abandon the multi-nation deal with Tehran about its nuclear program.
The sanctions aim to significantly reduce Iran’s oil exports, which have already fallen by around one million barrels a day since May, and cut Tehran off from international finance.
Israel had long opposed the said Iran deal, saying it was too limited in scope and timeframe.
The Jewish state also says that lifting of sanctions allowed Iran to finance militant groups and its own military activity.
Israel is particularly concerned with Iran’s involvement in the neighboring Syria and has pledged to keep it from entrenching itself militarily there.
The other parties to the Iran deal – Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia – oppose the US move and say the deal is working as intended in keeping Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.
Circumstances of death of a young biker again examined in court
In a case of motor accident in the Vilnius neighborhood Šiaurės miestelis that ended in the death of a young biker, the court is to hear witness evidence.
On Tuesday, the Vilnius Regional Court decided that in order to find out all significant circumstances of the case, one of the witnesses in the case was to be examined in the next hearing on 26 November.
A verdict of not guilty has been already given in the case, but the public prosecutors disagree.
On 22 August, the Vilnius City District Court acquitted a car driver 79-year-old Eduardas Osipovas of the fatal motorcycle accident by announcing that the biker was driving at great speed in the city and made a gross violation.
The Vilnius Regional Prosecutor’s Office asks the regional court to reverse the verdict of the district court and says that the major fault for the accident lies namely with E. Osipovas, and conclusions of the district court are unfounded.
The family lawyer of the deceased biker also asks for reversal of the verdict of not guilty.
The accident happened on 11 August 2015 at 15:00, when Škoda Fabia driven by E. Osipovas turned from Lakūnų street into Žirmūnų street and collided with the motorcycle that was driving the main road.
The Prosecutor’s Office charged the car driver of violating the traffic rules, which required to give way, and causing the traffic accident, which killed the man driving the motorcycle Piaggo on the main way.
The initial police reports say that it was a scooter driver who died, but later the investigation determined that the vehicle was equivalent to a motorcycle according to its power.
Rolandas Bužinskas, judge of the Vilniaus City District Court, said to BNS that experts had determined that the biker drove at the speed of 89.2 kilometers per hour though the permissible speed at the place was 50 kilometers per hour.
"The car driver could not foresee that the motorcycle would be going so fast,” the judge said.
Meanwhile, the elderly car driver said his speed was just 5-6 kilometers per hour.
Upon seeing the obstacle, the biker was braking and fell off the motorcycle before hitting Škoda Fabia.
The Prosecutor’s Office thinks that E. Osipovas, who left the side road for the main road, had to give way to the biker.

CEC will distribute money to political parties but will not give anything to the Social Democratic Labor Party
The Central Electoral Commission (CEC) is going to distribute a budget grant of almost EUR 3 million to the biggest political parties this week .
The ruling Social Democratic Labor Party of Lithuania (LSDDP) founded this spring, which is headed by Gediminas Kirkilas, a Deputy Speaker of the Seimas, is not to be given any money from the budget yet.
But some funds can be assigned already in the nearest future by a separate decision of the CEC if the legal environment, regulating distribution of grants to political parties, changes.
Laura Matjošaitytė, the CEC Chairman, informed VŽ that “a meeting of the commission is to be held on Thursday, where the commission is to take a decision regarding distribution of the semi-annual grant from the budget to political parties”.
According to her, the CEC is to take a decision on this issue by 15 November.
It is planned to distribute EUR 2.751 million to seven political parties, six of which are represented in the Seimas. euros.
The Homeland Union – Lithuanian Christian Democrats in opposition should get over 0.66 million euros, the ruling Farmers and Greens Union - about 0.55 million euros, the Social Democratic Party in opposition - about 0.5 million euros, the Liberal Movement in opposition - almost 0.4 million euros, the Labor Party that does not have its faction in the Seimas - about 0.23 million euros, the Party Order and Justice, which recently joined the ruling faction - almost 0.22 million euros, the Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania – Christian Families Alliance, which is represented in the Seimas but which treats itself neither a ruling party nor a party in opposition - about 0.18 million euros.
According to the currently effective law, which the CEC will comply with when distributing the budget money, grants are to be assigned to political parties, which meet the statutory requirements and have received at least 3% of votes in the past elections to the Seimas, municipal councils and the European Parliament.
Therefore, the current legal regulation does not allow LSDDP, which was founded only this spring, to expect any money from the budget.
It is so because this party has not been in an election yet.
But the ruling coalition seeks to amend the law in order that the Social Democratic Labor Party would get at least a couple hundred thousand euros, as even three elections will be held next year - municipal, presidential and to the European Parliament.
Relevant amendments to the Law on Political Parties and laws on the budget for this year, as adopted by the Seimas, have been vetoed by the President Dalia Grybauskaitė.
The Seimas has not yet made up its mind regarding this veto, but the representatives of the ruling parties Mr. Kirkilas and Ramūnas Karbauskis, the leader of the Farmers and Greens Union, say that the Seimas will seek to reject the President’s objections.
But that will not be made by the CEC meeting this Thursday, therefore, according to Ms. Matjošaitytė, “grants will be distributed according to the legal procedure that has existed until now”.
But the CEC Chairman admitted that if this or next week the Seimas rejected the President’s veto and the new amendments on distribution of the budget money to political parties came into effect, the CEC may consider a decision on assigning an additional grant to individual political forces, including LSDDP.
“Taking our decision, we will take into account the entire legal environment in force, as we are an executive authority that has to implement laws that are adopted,” she said.
If the Seimas were able to overturn the veto and the new laws came into force, the Government would assign additional money to parties according to them, having borrowed additional amounts for this purpose.
The grants already distributed to seven parties would not be diminished by reason of such a decision.

Poroshenko: those who ordered killing of the activist Handziuk must be punished
“I want to declare that none of the versions - and we have more than 20 today - will be ignored.
Each version will be diligently checked in accordance with prescribed investigation procedures.
I, as the President, have no possibility to get or must not get any information, which could undermine the course of the investigation.
But the authorities must ensure transparency, and law enforcement institutions must work effectively.
Only in this way we will be able to learn the truth and punish the evil,” spoke P. Poroshenko in a meeting with young people in Kiev on Tuesday.
He emphasized that he was highly interested that the assassination of K. Handziuk would be cleared up, and killers, organizers and sponsors of the crime “would be held liable”.
“After this case was requalified into a murder (case), they are absolutely justly and reasonably under the threat of the life sentence,” the President of Ukraine spoke.
He said that the society was right in requiring an open and unbiased investigation of the case.
P. Poroshenko pointed out that any statements by representatives of law enforcement authorities in the Parliament should demonstrate that “the authorities are resolved to hold the criminals and murderers liable, whoever they might be”.
He also said any political speculations on the subject would not help to solve the situation, but would make it more complicated.
“I urge all forces, both pro-government and pro-opposition, to spare unfounded arguments and, for God’s sake, not use this murder for public relations,” the President said.
- On the contrary, now we must stand united and make sure that the investigation would be efficient, just and transparent, fast - such as to instill trust in the society.
We just don’t have any other way.”
“No one will be allowed to make use of this situation in order to destabilize the country,” assured he.
K. Handziuk, a fighter against corruption, was assaulted in July with sulfuric acid in the city of Kherson.
She was an advisor to the mayor of this southern Ukrainian city.
The woman was hospitalized after the attack, but died in hospital on Sunday.
As the police and public prosecutors failed to find the perpetrators of this attack, the Prosecutor General of Ukraine Yuriy Lutsenko submitted his statement of resignation on Tuesday.
After her death, government officials were accused by public activists that they were incapable of conducting the investigation properly.
The activists also demanded resignation of the Prosecutor General and the Minister of the Interior.
“Today, I am presenting my statement of resignation,” J. Lutsenko informed members of the Parliament, while reading his investigation report.
The Parliament is yet to approve of the resignation of the Prosecutor General.
J. Lutsenko accused the activists of exerting pressure on the investigation and leaking important information, therefore it is difficult to find the culprits of K. Handziuk’s murder.
Bill Gates presented a waterless toilet
Presenting a futurist toilet, Bill Gates compared transfer from the conventional such facilities to those without water supply to the computer revolution in the eighth decade.
In the exhibition in Beijing, Microsoft founder Bill Gates presented a high tech toilet that does not need water in water supply pipelines, Reuters reported.
The waterless toilet operates according to the principle of separating hard and liquid waste.
Both types of sewage are processed into chemical fertilizers.
"The technologies, that you see here, are the biggest achievements in sanitation in the past 200 years,” Bloomberg quoted Bill Gates.
Creation of the technological toilet was funded by the charity fund established by Bill Gates and his wife Melinda.
The work on the facility, which could transform human waste into fertilizers and water, took seven years, the fund spent USD 200 million on this.
About 20 toilet models had been created in total, Bill Gates said.
Now, the facility has been finalized and can be offered for sale.
But in order to enable mass production of such toilets, the Gates fund is ready to spend 200 million more.
According to the Gates fund, due to poor sanitation, 500,000 children under 5 die in the world each year.
In fight against poor sanitation problems, such as cholera and others, money intended for health care, which already now amounts to 233 billion, is increased.
In order to better illustrate the sanitation situation, which needs to be improved, Bill Gates took a jar with faeces to the presentation of the toilet.
According to him, it’s a good reminder that a little sample “could contain 200 trillion rotavirus cells, 200,000 bacteria causing infectious diseases, and 100,000 parasitic worm eggs”.

Anxiety in France: concern about people’s deaths
French health officials announced on Monday a permanent ban on a widely used pesticide, after alarms were raised because of several dozen people got poisoned in the west of the country recently.
The ANSES health security agency said the decision to outlaw all products containing the pesticide metam sodium came after a new safety review launched earlier this year, before at least three outbreaks of poisoning were reported in the Maine-et-Loire department beginning in September.
The outbreaks had already prompted the government to suspend the use of the pesticide.
This ground disinfectant is not supposed to come in contact with plants or farm workers.
The product must be used in high doses to be effective.
Around 700 tonnes of it have been used annually in France.
At least 70 people, many of them farm workers, complained of burning eyes and throats, respiratory difficulties in Angers region, where a lot of lamb's lettuce is grown.
“These episodes confirm the soundness of our decision, but they did not precipitate it,” Francoise Weber, deputy director at ANSES, told the Ouest France newspaper on Monday.
Metam sodium - one of the most frequently used pesticides in the US and Europe - is considered a "probable human carcinogen" by the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA).
This pesticide, sold under brand names including Vapam and Sectagon, has been authorized in Europe until 2022, when a new safety review is scheduled.
“There was no other choice but to remove it from the market, whether or not alternatives exist,” F. Weber told the said paper.
“We're aware of the difficulties this will present to lamb's lettuce growers, to farmers in general, but public health comes first,” she said.
Farmers had already fumed against the government's suspension last month regarding use of metam sodium in an area, whose economy relies heavily on intensive agriculture.
This region near Nantes produces more than a half of 35,000 tonnes of lamb's lettuce consumed each year in Europe.
There will be “much less lamb's lettuce, radishes and leeks" available next season, Philippe Retiere, head of the Nantes growers' federation, told the news agency AFP after the suspension of metam sodium was announced by the government last month.
EUR 70 million invested into a shopping center with an observation wheel in Tallinn EUR
Next weekend, the capital of Estonia opens a new shopping center T1, to which the local capital real estate development company Pro Kapital Grupp invested 70 million euros.
According to the developer, the shopping center, the total area of which is 130,000 sq. m and the leasable area is 55,000 sq. m, will host 150 shops, service and entertainment places, over 30 cafes and restaurants.
For comparison, the total area of Vilnius Akropolis (including the office premises) is about 110,000 sq. m, with leasable area of 91,000 sq. m.
T1 is the first shopping center with the observation wheel on its roof, the developer says.
It will start operating at the beginning of next year.
Besides, its territory will also integrate an international transport gate: there is a tram stop nearby, long-distance buses will soon be running.
The main Rail Baltica terminal is also not far away, it is expected that in about 2026 it will serve 1 million passengers per year.
Paolo Michelozzi, the CEO of Pro Kapital Grupp, says that essential shifts are happening in the global business of shopping centers and the developers of T1 managed to find themselves at the forefront.
“We have created a new generation shopping center, giving emotions and experience one cannot get online.
It is a people’s attraction place in the very center of the city, travelers’ gate, an impressive place to be visited that calls for attention and at the same time giving quality time with family and friends,” the press release quotes Mr. Michelozzi’s words.
Huge attention to entertainment
According to the manager of the shopping center, T1 also has the largest entertainment and discoveries center in the Baltic States.
The total area assigned for entertainment in the object is 12,000 sq. m or a fifth of the total leasable area.
An exceptional focus point is an observation wheel on the roof.
It will take guests to 120 m above the sea level - only the TV tower is higher in Tallinn.
Under the observation wheel, on the fourth floor, there will be a trampoline park Super Skypark, that will open the largest in Europe trampoline center here and the first in Estonia basketball and volleyball courts on trampolines, the company says.
The interactive SkyLAB research and discoveries center promises to keep kids entertained for at least 5-6 hours.
The entertainment complex will also host 360° panoramic 4D cinema.
In addition to usual movies demonstrated on six screens, visitors will be able to get carried away by virtual reality cinema with interactive 7D cinema.
Beside visual effects and chairs moving in alignment with the rhythm of a movie, the sense of reality will be reinforced by wind, rain or snow effects, also by specifically chosen smells, smoke or mist in the cinema hall.
According to the developer, it is expected that opening of T1 will increase Estonia’s tourism income by EUR 13 million per year, attracting over 300,000 visitors.
Pro Kapital Grupp is listed on the Nasdaq Baltic exchange, also on the Frankfurt exchange.
Last year, the group earned EUR 1.8 million revenue in Lithuania and suffered a loss of EUR 350,000, the financial statements of Pro Kapital Grupp show.
In 2016, in the Lithuania market it earned almost EUR 9 million revenue and the net profit of EUR 2.4 million .
The shopping center T1 was constructed by the Estonian company Merko Ehitus.
President Paul Biya made an oath for the seventh term after controversial elections in Cameroon
During a ceremony supervised by Cavayé Yéguié Djibril, the President of the National Assembly, the 85-year-old P. Biya promised to safeguard the “integrity and unity” of the Western African state.
The oldest president in Africa, ruling its country for already the 35th year, was announced to win the elections held on 7 October with 71 percent of votes.
However, the elections were marred by low turnout, violence and suspected fraud.
On the eve of P. Biya’s inauguration, 79 pupils and three school staff members, including the principal, were kidnapped in a Presbyterian school in the North West region, where English speaking separatists pursue an armed campaign for independence.
Most of the 22 million population of Cameroon are French speaking, while one fifth are English speaking.
In 2016, in the North West province and in the neighboring South West province, after dissatisfaction with alleged discrimination in education, courts and economy, people started demanding autonomy.
In 2017, after P. Biya refused to make concessions, radicals announced an independent state, the “Republic of Ambazonia”, and took weapons.
According to non-governmental organizations, in separatist attacks and government’s response operations at least 400 civilians and more than 175 members of the security forces have been killed this year.
Over 300,000 people fled to escape the violence: some over the border into Nigeria, but most are forced to live from hand-to-mouth in the forests.
During the elections in October, mere 5 percent of the electorate voted in the North West region and 15 percent in the South West province.
In both the parts of the country, P. Biya had two thirds of votes.
Preliminary elections in the conservatives’ party: mistakes due to lack of experience
“Some things were missing in some places - please understand, the party has organized everything with its own resources.
Some municipalities allowed us to use their premises, but not all of them had polling-booths as we cannot acquire them ourselves.
We want to thank those who lent them,” the politician said.
According to him, complaints were made, but their content does not change the essence, and the violations themselves were not willful.
"Complaints were made.
Not everyone taking part in the elections were skilled at it - it was a new experience for them, too.
Thus, due to lack of experience not all the actions were in line with our procedures.
Therefore, the Central Electoral Commission had to give warnings urging to comply with the principles we have described.
Those complaints, though, are not a reason to doubt the results,” A. Anušauskas said.
According to the Chairman of the Central Electoral Commission, there were cases when voting ballots were not stamped - having learnt about that, the unstamped voting ballots found in ballot boxes were annulled.
In some towns there was not enough space, but, according to A. Anušauskas, complaints and violations related to only dozens of ballots.
"As the difference is several thousands, these ballots really do not make a basic difference for the outcome of the elections,” A. Anušauskas explained.
It is said that the turnout of party members in the elections was 55 percent, meanwhile the turnout of non-party voters was 69 percent.
Both the candidates had 400 observers, and 600 people worked in the commissions.
The results announced on Sunday do not change, either - the winning Ingrida Šimonytė had 79 percent of votes (16,418 votes), meanwhile Vygaudas Ušackas - 21 percent (4,441 votes).
On 17 November, the Council of the Homeland Union – Lithuanian Christian Democrats will officially delegate I. Šimonytė as the candidate in the elections for the office of the President of Lithuania to be held in May next year.
Trump says most probably he won’t meet Putin in Paris
John Bolton, the National Security Advisor in the White House, said earlier that D. Trump would meet V. Putin in Paris, where the events to commemorate 100 years since the end of World War I will take place this week.
However, before leaving for the last rallies before the US Congress midterm elections, D. Trump declared to journalists that he was not sure it was the right occasion to meet the Russian President.
“I am not sure we will meet in Paris.
Probably not,” the US President said.
Nevertheless, the head of the White House added that they would see each other during the G20 summit and “will probably have many meetings” afterwards.
D. Trump keeps trying “to recharge” the relationship with Moscow, regardless the suspicions that Russia meddled with the US President elections 2016.
Kęstutis Strupas asks to cancel the COEC decision
Kęstutis Strupas, former General Manager of the Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos, requests to cancel the decision of the Chief Official Ethics Commission (COEC), which admitted that some transactions failed to be declared in time, which constituted a violation of law.
K. Strupas’ complaint was examined by the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court on Tuesday.
The judgement will be announced on 26 November.
The applicant requests to cancel the COEC decision of 23 May, BNS was informed by the court representative Sigita Jacinevičienė Baltaduonė.
K. Strupas thinks that gifts to close relatives do not have to be declared, he says this is how he understood the exemption from the law.
The COEC announced in May that then removed General Manager of Santaros Klinikos K. Strupas and Silvija Strupienė, the Head of the Outpatient Rehabilitation Department of the Republican Vilnius University Hospital, violated provisions of the law regulating declaration of private interests.
It was found during the investigation that four transactions failed to be declared in time: a bank loan taken with the spouse in 2010, acquisition of securities from the bank in 2017, a gift (apartment) given to the daughter in 2017 and a loan given with the spouse to a natural person in 1996, which was not repaid.
S. Strupienė declared these transactions late, too.
Persons, having breached the Law on the Adjustment of Public and Private Interests in the Civil Service, cannot be given incentives for a year.
The Law orders to declare not only one’s own but also spouse’s data.
The COEC performed the investigation referring to the information on Info TV.
It examined whether K. Strupas and his spouse S. Strupienė, the Head of the Outpatient Rehabilitation Department of the Republican Vilnius University Hospital, declared their transactions properly and in time.
As Info TV announced, last year K. Strupas gave his daughter real property as a gift, the value of which was EUR 125,000.
But the former head of Santaros Klinikos and his wife had not indicated such data in their declarations of interests.
Law enforcement authorities have suspected K. Strupas and at least ten more persons of corruption - according to the authorities, for winning of computer, software public procurements in the hospital, illegal financial payoff was requested from companies, it was disguised as sponsorship.
It is suspected that K. Strupas made such agreements for at least five times, when Santaros Klinikos was performing public procurements in the area of information technologies.
K. Strupas denies the accusations.
Under suspicion of corruption, Prof. K. Strupas was dismissed from the office of the head of Santaros Klinikos in September.
By a decision of Santaros Klinikos stakeholders the Ministry of Health and Vilnius University, the employment relationship with K. Strupas was terminated on his own initiative.
He had been the head of the hospital since 10 November 2013.
Now, the temporary head of Santaros Klinikos is Prof. Juozas Raistenskis until a new General Manager is elected by way of a competition, which is to be announced this year already.

Different teaching in schools: promises of less tests and more practice
Such changes in the education content are planned by the Ministry of Education and Science, which introduced them in the forum “Change in education content: foreign experience for solutions in Lithuania”, which was held in Vilnius on Monday.
Jurgita Petrauskienė, the Minister of Education and Science, who spoke during the discussion, said that over EUR 30 million had been invested into education content update in the recent ten years, however, no results are visible.
“According to the results of the international student assessment PISA, our school students’ achievements are below the average of the OECD countries,” the Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskienė said.
The report of the Ministry of Education and Science quotes the OECD expert Phil Lambert, who noted that Lithuania was too much focused on giving knowledge rather than practical application of knowledge.
According to him, Lithuanian general education curricula focus a lot on developing students’ literacy, critical thinking, respect and responsibility, however, there is lack of focus on developing children’s creativity, entrepreneurship, financial literacy, empathy.
Gražvydas Kazakevičius, the Vice-minister of Education and Science, presenting changes in general education content, stated that the curricula, updating of which is started this academic year, will decrease in scope, will be more specific, the study subjects will be more interrelated.
According to the Vice-minister, students’ education will be more individualized, schools will become more independent - they will be allowed to prepare 10 to 30 percent of their unique education content, the current students’ assessment system will transform into the cumulative point, students’ competences acquired informally will gain more weight.
There will be less of standardized tests.
The promise is that the general education curricula will be digital, user friendly, linked to e-resources, a task bank.
The update of the education content is aimed at having students’ achievements in the international PISA assessment improve at least by 10 percent, the gap between students’ achievements decrease by a third, students acquire modern competences, versatile literacies in school.
Lithuania plans to allocate EUR 7.8 million of the European Union funds and funds from the state budget for updating the education content from May 2018.
It is expected that the project of the updated general education curricula will be tested in some schools in the academic year 2019-2020, and their implementation will start in all the schools since September 2021.
At the beginning of October, the Ministry was criticized about the project of almost EUR 8 million carried out by the Education Development Centre, which is intended for updating the general curricula for elementary, medium and secondary education.
EUR 7.8 million is intended to be allocated for this purpose over the period of four years, the first procurement for EUR 1.3 million was announced at the beginning of October in search for education curricula drafters.
As experts have criticized this procurement, it was suspended, the Minister of Education and Science J. Petrauskienė fired Giedrius Vaidelis, the Director of the Education Development Centre.
Training in Lithuania on how to react to an extreme flood
On Monday, a ten days training will start in Lithuania for improving the institutions’ reaction to an extreme flood.
As the Fire and Rescue Department (FRD) informed, the training will allow to check how state institutions are ready to work when an emergency of national level is announced in the country, for example, a flood: to liquidate its consequences, to coordinate search for and rescue of people and urgent evacuation from flooded areas, to organize provision with drinking water, food, to ensure the necessary power supply and to provide other measures for protection of people.
More than 100 representatives from all the ministries, other institutions of the country will take part in the training, as well as members of centers for emergency operations from 12 municipalities.
On 5-13 November, the preparatory stage of the training will be performed, during which the municipalities, having received the Hydrometeorological Service information from the FRD about persistent precipitation and starting flood, will take decisions on the emergency management.
The active phase of the training is planned for 14-15 November.
During it, the National Center for Emergency Operations will operate in the Department, whereas institutional centers for emergency operations will operate in state and municipal institutions.
After the Government announces an emergency of national level due to flood, the head of operations appointed by the Prime Minister will lead the liquidation of the emergency, elimination of its consequences, actions of protection and rescue of people and assets.
Mindaugas Kanapickas, Deputy Director of the FRD, says that the most important thing in the training is to check readiness of institutions to perform functions provided for in legal acts, to assess information exchange possibilities, to check readiness to warn and inform people, state and municipal institutions, bodies and companies about the calamity threat and “to improve state institutions’ emergency management skills”.
The training will also be an opportunity for demonstrating joint capacities of Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonians firefighters-rescuers to pump huge volumes of water from flooded areas.

According to J. Lutsenko, the investigation carried out by law enforcement authorities mentions 12 persons possibly related to ordering the murder of K. Handziuk.
However, one of the most probable versions of the investigation was leaked to mass media, which is a threat for the success of the investigation.
According to the Prosecutor General, the information leakage provided suspects with knowledge essential for them.
J. Lutsenko added that he personally knew K. Handziuk and he was indignant that some politicians used her blood for public relations.
"In order that no one would have a pretext to say that someone clings to power, I want to declare that I am submitting my letter of resignation.
Today, I will submit it to the President of Ukraine and you will need to consider this issue in the Rada,” J. Lutsenko’s speech in the Rada was quoted by the publication Obozrevatel.
It is written that J. Lutsenko added that "he cannot permit the diarchy in the country, when the law enforcement system is ruined without any evidence, even for revealed crimes".
J. Lutsenko is regarded to be a close comrade of the country’s President Petro Poroshenko.
He was appointed Prosecutor General on 12 May 2016 after a prolonged attempt to remove this predecessor Viktor Shokin, who had been suspected of covering corruption of top level officials and politicians.
Minister of Energy Ž. Vaičiūnas is to meet representatives of Orlen Lietuva
As Elta was informed by Aurelija Vernickaitė, advisor to the Minister of Energy, in the meeting they will talk about achievement of renewable energy sources targets in the transport sector until 2020 and after 2020.
According to the European Commission (EC), transport is the only sector which is currently below the trajectories determined in the aggregated National Renewable Energy Action Plans (NREAP) at EU level, with a 6 % share of renewable energy sources in 2015.
The EC holds that a rather slow progress to the mandatory 10% target in transport is due to various difficulties including relatively high greenhouse gas mitigation costs and regulatory uncertainty.
Renewable energy in this sector comes largely from biofuels (88%), with electricity playing a more limited role at this stage.
The Seimas set to consider the proposal to supplement the corruption investigation questions with conservatives’ appeal to the Constitutional Court
On Tuesday, the Seimas approved of the tabled proposal which had been registered by the “farmer” Agnė Širinskienė in charge of the investigation of illegal influence on political processes.

The Seimas provisional investigation commission, currently performing a new political corruption investigation, has been instructed to investigate possible illegal influence in 2008-2016.
A. Širinskienė proposed to expand this period indicating that “significant information came up in public space about possible illegal influence and impact on political processes and state authorities”.
In the draft, A. Širinskienė mentions “possible representation of interests of pension funds in the legislative process or by appealing to the Constitutional Court or attempts to affect decision making processes in such significant independent authorities as the Chief Official Ethics Commission”.
The appeal to the Constitutional Court regarding pensions was initiated by the conservatives in the opposition.
The governing “farmers” found out that the conservatives in their appeal mostly relied on arguments of advocates of private pension funds.
The “famers’” leaders accuse Povilas Urbšys, their former comrade, of exerting influence on the Chief Official Ethics Commission (COEC).
They say that the former Chairman of the Committee on State Administration and Local Authorities in the Seimas could have instructed the COEC members to dismiss Mindaugas Siaurys, the former head of the Prevention Division of the COEC.
At the end of September, the Seimas formed a commission to investigate potentially illegal influence, impact of interested persons or their groups on the course of the elections, coalition formation, work of parliamentary factions, individual politicians, activities and funding of political parties and public movements, legislative processes, election, appointment of heads, members of management or supervisory bodies of enterprises controlled by the State, public institutions.
It was also proposed to enquire what information was provided by law enforcement and intelligence authorities to competent authorities and what the response was.
The investigators should present their conclusions by 1 May next year.
The election campaigns for the office of the President, for the European Parliament will be carried out then.
Among 12 members of the commission, seven are representatives of the “farmers”.
Other members are two members of the Social Democratic Labour Party, a member of the Order and Justice, a liberal and a member of the Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania – Christian Families Alliance.
The conservatives and social democrats refused to take part in the commission.
The new investigation was initiated by Ramūnas Karbauskis, the Chairman of the governing Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union.
According to him, the investigation by the Committee on National Security and Defense (CNSD) in the last session, which was basically about the same matters, demonstrated that the investigation had to be continued.
The German domestic intelligence chief has lost his office
The 55-year-old H. G. Maassen has brought more controversy by stating that he has been targeted by “radical left forces” in A. Merkel’s coalition.
Therefore, he has not been given another government job, as promised earlier, but forced into retirement.
In addition, it turned out last weekend that in a meeting of representatives of the European domestic intelligence organizations held in Warsaw several weeks ago, H. G. Maassen criticized the “naive” immigration policy of A. Merkel.
Horst Seehofer, the German Minister of the Interior, who has been defending the intelligence chief for a long time, declared in the press conference on Monday that the latter comments of H. G. Maassen were unacceptable and “disappointed him personally”.
H. Seehofer, under pressure both regarding this dispute and regarding the poor performance of his party in the local government elections in Bavaria, asked the President Frank-Walter Steinmeier to retire H. G. Maassen.

Plump girls defeat wedding dress stereotypes
A plump girl in a white puffy wedding dress - mission (im)possible?
Can a white swan swimming down the aisle be larger than size S or M and still look attractive?
Participants of the plus-size reality show "Size (r)evolution" will prove already today that beauty and elegance of a bride do not really depend on the woman’s weight.
But that is not everything - one of the girls in the project will shed tears of happiness - her boyfriend will show up on the shooting scene.
"Still there are people who think that bigger girls do not get boys’ attention or glances.
It is only a myth - my boyfriend is a sportsman himself, but he likes me as I am, he does not require some standard body shape from me," the show participant Aurika would say before appearing in a wedding dress.
A wedding dress is not an easy outfit, in all senses of the word - it is a complicated structure, with a lot of fabric, the dress is heavy, not comfortable to move in.
Some women also think that a bigger girl in a white dress will look even bigger and, therefore, will be less self-confident.
I can assure you that a properly selected model of a dress really solves this ‘problem’," explained one of the show commission members, fashion designer Robertas Kalinkinas.
The girls’ fate in the project is decided by R. Kalinkinas together with the rest of the commission - Erika Vitulskienė, who opened a plus-size fashion house, the photographer and social media star Naglis Bierancas and TV producer Laura Paukštė.
"When we, the commission members, have to select a girl to leave the show, we have lots of arguments - one way or another, we represent different spheres and have different perceptions of the future winner of the show.
The task of demonstrating wedding dresses was also made harder by the fact - I can already reveal it now - that two new girls arrived, who really were no worse than the veterans of the show.
The evening was special in all senses,” R. Kalinkinas says.
The newly arrived girls - 23-year-old Ieva known by her scandalous behavior in a summer reality show and 31-year-old Dovilė, a mom of two kids of exceptional beauty - participated in the casting for "Size (r)evolution" as other girls and were among the best twenty.
Unfortunately, after the first very open photo sessions of the girls on the streets of Vilnius, they had to say goodbye to the project.
The girls were returned to the show by LNK audience who voted for their favorites on the portal of this TV channel.
The reality show of plump beauties, which has international recognition, has been going on in Lithuania for the second week already - the plus-size girls compete here for the title of the first plus-size star in the country.
Eight girls remain so far, and all of them understand perfectly well that only one can be the winner.
An intriguing and unpredictable week of the reality show "Size (r)evolution" starts already this Monday evening at 20:30 on LNK.
Actor I. Elba elected the sexiest man in the world
The US magazine People announced world’s sexiest man of the year.
The title went to the 46-year-old British actor Idris Elba.
Though the man says the news was unexpected, speaking about his new title he was not looking for words.
I thought: "No way!
Really?".
Then I checked myself in the mirror and thought - yeah, I look kind of sexy today, - the actor shared laughing.
Speaking frankly, Idris admitted that this title, it was a very nice feeling, an ego boost for sure.
The British star says he used to get some picking and jeer, which made his childhood not easy, because, as he says, he was “very tall and clumsy”.
The young actor was also sneered at by his peers and used to become an object of taunting also due to his rare and unusual name and his African origin.
“But as soon as I grew a moustache and muscles, I was the coolest kid on the block,” Idris smiles.
When he does not play in movies, I. Elba works as a DJ in parties in Spain, particularly in the busy Ibiza.
In leisure time, he enjoys Thailand boxing and has some talent for fashion that he realizes by creating his own line of outfits.
The British actor says that family comes first for him, therefore he is planning a wedding with his fiance Sabrina Dhowre.
I. Elba has become the 33rd world’s sexiest man elected by the magazine People.
In 2017, the title went to Blake Shelton.
Man beaten to death during a binge in Širvintos district
A man was beaten to death during a binge in Šalkiškės village in Širvintos district on Monday evening.
According to the Vilnius county police, a report was received at 21:16 that a man had beaten his neighbor during a binge.
Upon arrival, the ambulance found that the man (born in 1943) was dead.
The suspect (born in 1994) was detained, with 2.53 blood alcohol level.

The ruling parties do not demand 20 km distance for waste-to-energy power plants any more
Vilnius cogeneration power plant, constructed by Gariūnai marketplace.
The ruling parties do not seek any more that 20 km distance to settlements be kept in case of construction of waste-to-energy power plants.
“Farmer” Kęstutis Mažeika, the head of the Committee on Environmental Protection, registered an amendment to the Law on Waste Management in the Seimas on Monday, refusing such a requirement.
According to Mr. Mažeika, the “farmers’” faction, that previously supported the provision regarding the distance of 20 km, now is going to support the amendment for its cancellation.
The amendment registered by Mr. Mažeika provides that from January 2019 waste-to-energy power plants could be constructed in accordance with statutory requirements for environmental protection and protection of public health.
He admits that the amendments are proposed with regard to the President’s doubts regarding such a ban.
“Taking into account the definition of a residential territory, it is obvious that it would be almost impossible to find a place where the said objects could be constructed,” the chairman of the committee says.
In October, the ruling majority opposed the President’s veto on the amendments making requirements for construction of waste-to-energy power plants stricter.
In addition to the ban to construct waste-to-energy power plants at less than 20 km distance to settlements, the amendments gave the Government permission to take decisions regarding the future of the two plants already under construction, with regard to public health interests.
Mr. Mažeika does not propose to amend this provision.
The power plant in Vilnius to run on waste and biofuel is constructed by the energy group Lietuvos energija, and in Kaunas - together with Fortum Heat Lietuva, a company of the Finnish energy concern Fortum.
The latter already burns waste in Klaipėda.
Speaking about a possible compromise in Brexit negotiations
On Monday, the British and Irish leaders discussed a possible compromise on the fraught issue of Northern Ireland, which is holding up Brexit talks, Dublin said.
In a phone call, the British Prime Minister Theresa May suggested the possibility to review the so-called mechanism for backstop arrangement intended to keep an open border between British Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which is a Member State of the European Union.
The Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar indicated he would consider the idea, but rejected any possibility for Britain to unilaterally pull out of the arrangement, according to a statement issued by the Irish Government.
In the call, Th. May “raised the possibility to review a mechanism for the backstop”, the statement said.
“Varadkar indicated an openness to consider proposals for a review, provided that it was clear that the outcome of any such review could not involve a unilateral decision to end the backstop,” the Government statement said.
Brexit talks are stalled over how to avoid frontier checks on the British and Irish land border, when Britain leaves the single market and the customs union in March next year.
Both sides agree to a “backstop” to keep the border of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland open until they strike a wider trade deal to avoid additional customs checks on the border.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to follow the EU customs rules, but London wants the whole of the UK to stay temporarily aligned.
The Daily Telegraph reported on Monday that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab is pushing for Britain to be able to pull out of the backstop arrangement unilaterally after three months.
But L. Varadkar told reporters in Dublin that his government “can’t countenance” this.
“A backstop with a three-month limit on it or expiry date of that nature isn’t worth the paper it’s written on,” he declared.
Earlier, both London and Brussels played down suggestions of a breakthrough in the Brexit talks, after a weekend report in Britain suggesting a deal was close.
“I would say that we continue to make good progress in the negotiations, but there’s still work to do,” said Th. May’s spokesman in London.
The European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas also told reporters: “We’re not there yet.”
Nobel Prize laureates urge to ensure access to reliable information
A group of distinct thinkers, with Nobel Prize laureates among them, announced a declaration on Monday, urging to ensure the right to reliable information in the Internet era.
Among 25 persons, who signed the International Declaration on Information and Democracy, there are economists Amartya Sen and Joseph Stiglitz, Nobel peace winner Iran lawyer and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi, also Nobel literature winner writer Mario Vargas Llosa.
"We urge leaders of good will on all continents to take action to promote democratic models and open public debates, in which citizens can take decisions on the basis of facts," the group’s report says.
They reason that “the global information and communication space” is a common good, which “must be protected in order to facilitate the exercise of freedom of expression and opinion”.
"Human beings have a fundamental right to receive information that is freely gathered, processed and disseminated, according to the principles of commitment to truth, plurality of viewpoints and rational methods of establishing facts," added the authors of the declaration.
The document calls for help from the leaders of the world, including the US President Donald Trump, who often criticizes “fake news”, but, nevertheless, is regularly accused of distortion of facts.
The signatories urged that the leaders of the world should express their position on the issue in the Peace Forum to be held in Paris on 11-13 November.
This declaration was prepared in two months under the guidance of Sh. Ebadi and Christophe Deloire, the head of Reporters Without Borders (RSF), an organization for protection of mass media freedom and journalists’ rights, which is based in Paris.
Former President of Senegal Abdou Diouf, Chinese lawyer and human rights activist Teng Biao and political scientist Francis Fukuyama are also among the signatories.
Seimas approved bigger fines for harmful products
Seimas approved of amendments to the Law on Product Safety, which provide that fines for product safety violations must be increased.
The amendments were voted in favor of unanimously.
As Antanas Vinkus, a member of the Seimas Committee on Health Affairs, said speaking about the new draft, the fact that the amendments aim at better protection of product consumers is welcome.
Besides, its provisions are in line with the requirements of the decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
"I think that the proposed draft law makes a more perfect and more specific distribution among all participants of the supply and distribution process: manufacturers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
The practice shows that the current system of fines does not always prevent further violations, as entities, having paid fines, continue committing repeated violations,” A. Vinkus spoke.
The draft was prepared by the Ministry of Economy; after the Government’s approval, the Seimas Committee on Economics added its own proposals.
The amendments to the Law are aimed at increasing fines for violations, raising protection of consumer rights, giving more power to market supervisory authorities and creating a clear system of requirements for product safety and supervision over their compliance.
According to the Ministry of Economy, currently manufacturers are not subject to the obligation to label a product properly and thus to ensure its traceability.
Besides, according to the ministry, the market supervisory authorities, which perform state control over safety of products, do not have the right to enter manufacturers’ and suppliers’ territory, buildings, premises, to perform inspections, which hinders the work of the authorities.
The ministry holds that the current term of six months for imposition on fines and giving of warnings is too short for identifying a violation, making an investigation and imposing a fine.
Also, according to the ministry, the current fines are not efficient enough.
Companies often repeatedly breach requirements of the law - in 2017 only it was done by 14 companies.
The Ministry of Economy proposed to establish a duty for manufacturers to properly label a product and thus to ensure its traceability, in order to make it easier for market supervisory authorities to reveal suppliers of non-compliant products.
It is also proposed that market supervisory authorities, in performance of state control over product safety, would have the right to enter the territory, buildings, premises of the entities that produce, supply products to the market, to perform inspections.
The amounts of fines for violations of the law are going to be increased.
A manufacturer, importer or authorized representative that placed dangerous products on the market and a distributor that supplied them to the market, a service provider who provided or provides dangerous services would be subject to a fine of EUR 150 to 2,500 (currently, a fine of EUR 144 to 1,448).
If the State Consumer Rights Protection Authority (SCRPA) or another market supervisory authority decides to prohibit placement and supply of dangerous products on / to the market or provision of dangerous services, a fine of EUR 1,000 to 5,000 (currently, EUR 868 to 4,344) would be imposed.
In case of failure to fulfil the demand to remove dangerous products from the market, to recall them from consumers and to destroy them, a fine of EUR 2,500 to 6,500 (currently, EUR 1,448 to 5,792) would be imposed.
If dangerous products caused harm to consumer’s health, a fine of EUR 2,500 to 15,000 (currently, EUR 1,448 to 11,584) would be imposed.
If dangerous products caused consumer’s death, a fine of EUR 6,500 to 25,000 (currently, EUR 5,792 to 23,169) would be imposed.
According to the ministry, in Poland and Austria a violation of legal acts on product safety is subject to a fine of up to EUR 25,000 (the minimal amount of the fine is not set), in Belgium - a fine of EUR 26 to 600,000, in Romania - a fine of EUR 155 to 6,666, in Bulgaria - a fine of EUR 125 to 7,500.
10-year old had a baby: raped by a family member
An event in Colombia astonished millions.
A 10-year old raped by an elder brother gave birth to a healthy boy.
The baby was born via a C-section, but both the girl and her baby are doing well.
They have been in medical care for some time.
It is yet some time before the young mother and her baby will be released home.
“According to the information I have received from the police, the minor became pregnant after she was sexually abused by a family member - her brother,” the director of the hospital, where the baby was delivered, told a foreign TV station.
The police are investigating the case as a rape and child abuse.
A Norwegian armed battalion took part in the NATO trainings in the most remote and severe locations.
Soldiers from the Norwegian armed forces took part in a series of complicated trainings in the mountains to the north of Oslo, capital of the country.
It is a part of the NATO training exercise “Trident Juncture 2018” - the biggest NATO training since the end of the Cold War.
After the September 11 terrorist attacks, most of the soldiers of the second military force battalion of Norway spent a lot of time far away from home, in such places as Afghanistan, i.e. in warm climate.
But they are mostly skilled to fight in Arctic conditions, and these skills of theirs are particularly useful now, when the NATO shifts its attention.
In the recent days, in the mountains to the east of Tynset, often in the most remote and severe locations, soldiers engaged in fake combats against real British soldiers.
Soldiers are skilled to survive in this cold in the wild, but in the severe climate they have to carry much bigger weights on their shoulders - one backpack weighs about 50 kg.
Soldiers staying in the command post say that they share their skills how to survive and fight in such conditions with other NATO soldiers.
According to the soldiers, this training, which reminds of real war actions more than any other, will train them to be ready if real threat occurs.

The former vice-mayor of Kaunas has no plans to be back in politics
The former vice-mayor of Kaunas Povilas Mačiulis, who left his job in the municipality and the organization Vieningas Kaunas in order to support Vygaudas Ušackas in the presidential elections, does not intend to return to politics and is going to focus on business instead.
“I am going to focus on business.
I am a shareholder of several companies, I also have ideas for new projects.
And, what is more important, I will be able to enjoy a possibility to devote more time to my family,” P. Mačiulis said to BNS.
He said he did not intend to run in the next municipal elections.
P. Mačiulis has not had an opportunity yet to talk to V. Ušackas after he lost the preliminary elections of the Homeland Union – Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) to Ingrida Šimonytė on Sunday.
"Speaking frankly, we did not have time yet to discuss the results with him and the team in detail and to share plans for the future.
It is obvious that after Vygaudas dropped out of the further elections, this stage of my life is over,” P. Mačiulis said.
He said he did not regret his decision to leave the Kaunas political stage in order to support V. Ušackas, he only regretted that “Lithuania lost a unique possibility to have a real leader in international relationships”.
P. Mačiulis shortly worked as a deputy to the mayor of Kaunas in 2011, and later he returned to this office in 2015 after the elections which were successful for Vieningas Kaunas.
He is a shareholder of private school Erudito licėjus and several other companies.
Workers busy in the Kaunas Castle: what are they doing here?
Kaunas citizens, seeing workers busy in the Kaunas Castle, have hoped that finally the restoration of the remaining tower has been started.
Gabrielius Sužiedėlis, the Director of the Kaunas City Museum, explained to the portal kauno.diena.lt that these were operations for replacement of the cover of protective shelters of the Southwest tower with a defense wall fragment.
He said that the shelters would be made of tin.
“The worn-out wreck tin cover was a threat - people could fall in and get hurt - so it was necessary to replace it.
The shelters were not humidity resistant, so the heritage suffered, too,” the museum director explained.
Will these shelters be similar to those that existed several centuries ago?
“All works have been coordinated with heritage and other authorities,” G. Sužeidėlis added that they were seeking as authentic result as possible, but the practical aspect was also important - the shelters were to shield the heritage against humidity.
A universal solution was made in cooperation with heritage authorities.
Previously, the Kaunas Castle elements were tinned in Soviet times, which means that they did not have historic value as such,” the Director of the Kaunas City Museum went to details.
The contract for works was signed on 2 October.
The works are not to take more than 3 months after the contract was signed.
“We expect them to be completed by the end of November,” the museum director voiced his expectations.
He said that the value of the works to be performed was almost EUR 24,000.
According to him, this amount was in this year’s budget.
The works in the Kaunas Castle are being performed by the company Statija.
Kauno.diena.lt has previously written, on the basis of earlier investigations, what the Kaunas Castle could have looked like before.

Eastern Europe Studies Centre will cooperate with two famous US “brain centers”
According to Linas Kojala, the head of the EESC, established in Vilnius and operating for almost thirteen years, instillation in the USA will enable it to implement projects and will make the voice of Lithuania heard better on the other side of the Atlantic.
“We have purposefully worked in this direction for a few months.
I am delighted that two major institutions see us as partners and look for possibilities for joint actions.
I am certain we will find space for such actions, as the topics of the NATO, security, disinformation, development of the Eastern Partnership countries we happen to analyze are priority topics for them, too,” Kojala said.
The agreements say that the EESC and the US institutions will work together in preparing applications for international projects, will exchange expert experience and knowledge, experts’ visits will be organized.
