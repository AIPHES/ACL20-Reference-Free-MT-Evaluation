Eemeli Kouki led Hurrikaanit to home victory in the first game of the season - Savo Volley won the second time
Hurrikaani-Loimaa, the team that has won a medal in the Finland Volleyball League for as many as seven consecutive time, began the season 2018-19 with a home victory, when they beat Loimu Raisio 3-0 on Saturday.
Universal player Eemeli Kouki, who has returned to Finland from Romania, was the most effective Hurrikaani player with a total of 22 points.
I had some potential possibilities abroad, but they never materialised, and then I got a phone call from Loimaa.
We reached a pretty quick agreement, Kouki said.
Toni Rumpunen, who, like Kouki, also has played for Loimu, supported Kouki with 18 points.
The most effective player of the visiting team with 17 points was national team spiker Samuli Kaislasalo, whose deal with Loimu is for one match at a time.
It is always important to win the opening match.
Many players had experience from the opposing side, too, and that brought some extra to the match.
Our game is not ready yet, but our goal is naturally to continue winning medals, Kouki said.
Määttänen the best in Savo Volley
Savo Volley’s Miro Määttänen was the team’s best player with 18 points, when the team beat Vantaa Ducks 3-0 at Vieremä.
Our game was unpredictable especially when on the offensive, but luckily we managed to scrape a victory for us.
I for one didn't have any conscious energy differences when playing against my old team, Määttänen said.
Antti Siltala, who began his career in Vieremän Lentopallo regional series in 2000-01, made 12 points.
Head coach Jukka Tuovinen was happy with many things.
The hall was small, which means the atmosphere was excellent the whole time.
I've a nice feeling after the opening match at home.
Miro was a king, and Silli played a good game, too, Tuovinen said.
Siltala’s previous League season was 2006-07, when he won silver at Pielaveden Sampo with Tuovinen as head coach then, too.
Thiago Maciel was the Ducks’ most effective player with 14 points.
Mikkonen again the star of Akaa-Volley
Joni Mikkonen,the best scorer in the League during 2012-13, has had a strong start this season, too.
The spiker made 25 points when Akaa-Volley had their first win of the season after beating Kokkolan Tiikerit 3-2.
My season has had a pretty good start.
Today a loss was close, though, since we were losing the fourth set 17-21.
Somewhere we managed to find a set won, and a fifth set at the same time, said Mikkonen.
The best scorer of Tiikerit, a team that was in the final some seasons ago, was spiker Edvarts Buivids with 28 points.
Fellow countryman Aleksandrs Kudrjashovs supported him with 17 points.
We didn’t manage to get almost any hold of the opponent’s spiker, Mikkonen complimented.
Finland tops the Human Capital Index
Finland is at the head of the world in human capital comparison, science journal Lancet reports.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
195 countries were compared during these years.
Finland was the number one in the statistics during both years.
The top five in 2016 was nearly the same as in 1990.
Before it was Iceland, Denmark, Canada, and Netherlands behind Finland.
Later Netherlands ranked one position higher, and instead of Canada, Taiwan was on the list.
In 2016, the lowest-ranking countries in the comparison were Niger and South Sudan.
When measuring human capital, the education level, admission to education, skills and helath of the nation are examined.
The World Bank has outlined that human capital is connected to economic growth.
Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois kep Atletico in check, the derby ended in a goalless draw
Real Madrid goal keeper Thibaut Courtois got brilliant saves, and the La Liga match between the two Madrid teams ended in a goalless draw late on Saturday.
Atletico Madrid’s Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa came closest to scoring, but Belgian keeper Courtois managed a save.
Courtois played three seasons in Atletico while on loan from Chelsea.
In the beginning of the week the international football association FIFA named him as the goalkeeper of the year.
Gareth Bale got Real's best place for scoring, but his shot went past the goal in the end of the opening half.
After the half time, Bale stayed at the bench because of a thigh injury.
According to ESPN, disappointed Real supporters shouted the name of the top scorer Cristiano Ronaldo who transferred to Juventus.
Attacks against abortion rights now in the United States - a strong documentary tells us why
The US Senate is currently attempting to investigate, whether Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump's nominee for one of the nine members of the Supreme Court can be chosen for the job.
Many in the Republican party hope that with Kavanaugh's decisive vote, so-called Roe v. Wade decision that made abortion legal in the USA in 1973 could be reversed.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's Reversing Roe documentary illustrates how the current situation has developed over the years.
As unbelievable as it feels, the topic is timely also in Finland.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (Blue Reform) has conducted pr work against safe abortion, and received different levels of support from the greater part of our country's Members of Parliament.
In the beginning of this strong documentary, we meet gynaecologist Colleen McNicholas, who is now, because of the law restrictions, the only Missouri state doctor providing abortions.
An armed guard at the clinic says he is defending the freedom of religion in the United States.
The news videos remind us about lethal terrorist attacks against the clinics.
Let us move to the time abortion was illegal in the United States.
At that time, an evangelical clergymen alliance directed women to reliable abortion doctors.
The reasoning of the interviewed pastor is sound, but actually not really needed, a picture of a woman died of a self-made abortion is enough.
There were about 5,000 deaths a year in the United States.
The legalisation of abortions was defended especially by the Republican party.
Already in 1967, California Governor Ronald Reagan signed the abortion rights act.
Later it was precisely Reagan during his 1980 presidential campaign who, in a revolutionary manner, began to mix religion with politics in order to draw voters.
Another to go back on his stance on abortion was Reagan's follower - George Bush senior.
And the same was done also by Donald Trump.
The documentary reaches the very core of the matter when it looks for the founding reason for the politicisation of abortion.
When religious organisation supporting racial segregation were refused tax exemption, they became politically active.
Abortion was chosen as their rallying cry.
Religion has brought exceptional knots to politics.
While writing this, the situation in the United States is such that a president, who bragged about his sexual harassment but managed to win the votes of the religious Right with his stand on abortion, announced Kavanaugh as a nominee to the Supreme Court, who is now charged of sexual harassment by many women.
Kavanaugh may hold the balance of power to decide about the rights of 164 million American women and girls.
Israeli forces shot seven Palestinians, including two children - big protests on the border
Nearly 200 Palestinians have been killed in six months, as Israel has fired at the protesters in the border.
Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians in the Gaza border on Friday, Ministry of health of the Palestinian National Authority says.
Ministry of health of the Palestinian National Authority says the dead include two children: 12-year-old and 14-year-old boys.
According to the ministry, 505 people have been wounded.
89 of these were wounded by bullets.
Israel Defense Forces have confirmed they opened fire and made an air strike to the border, when the protesters threw rocks and explosives at Israeli forces.
The forces say they resorted to force in order to keep the protesters from breaking the boundary fence or attempting to cross to the other side.
At least 191 Palestinians have died in Gaza protests since March, when Palestinians began weekly protests at the border.
According to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, there are 12,000 wounded.
The protesters demand entry for the Palestinian families to the areas the Palestinians had to vacate when Israeli state was founded in 1948.
A Palestinian sniper has killed one Israeli soldier.
Explosives sent from the Palestinian side strapped to kites and helium balls have started fires in Israeli forests and on cultivated land.
Teemu Pukki gained a penalty kick - didn't get to shoot it himself
Wigan's central defender Chey Dunkley seemed to tackle him from behind inside penalty area.
Referee Gavin Ward let the game continue.
According to his interpretation, the tackle was clean.
Teemu Pukki could not believe his eyes.
The incident probably was on referee Ward's mind, as he judged a penalty kick to Norwich on the 85th minute when Pukki was knocked down.
Ward showed the penalty spot, and Mario Vrancic scored the winning 1-0 goal.
Pukki has scored five times for Norwich in the Premier League.
The previous one was finished stylishly using his pectorals against QPR on last Saturday.
Pukki has a taste for working again.
After he lost the ball, he carried on with the situation until its end.
He created scoring spots and was tireless in the defence.
This was Norwich's fifth match in two weeks.
The team continues in the Football League Cup.
They have a five-win streak behind them.
Paedophile help service immediately filled up with reservations - in Finland about 40,000 are attracted to children
It is estimated that about two per cent of men and a small part of women are at least somewhat attracted to pre-teens.
In Finland this means about 40,000 people.
Those sexually attracted to children or young people have up to the present had a difficult time finding help.
The Finnish Foundation for Supporting Ex-offenders and Sexpo foundation have a common SeriE project that educates professionals in meeting paedophiles as clients and helps people who are sexually attracted to children.
When the project was published in the spring, it caused a real stream of emails to Sexpo, who offer counselling and therapy, and all the appointments were quickly reserved, Yle says.
It is promised, however, that appointments will become available during the autumn.
Sexual attraction towards children causes shame to many.
Most of the people who have noticed paedophiliac feelings in themselves have not acted out their fantasies, thus committing no criminal acts.
However, the attraction is usually a permanent trait.
Most of these people hope to be rid of the thoughts that cause distress and depress them.
They also make normal life more difficult, sexual therapist Patricia Thesleff, who works as an expert in the project, says to Yle.
I think the work is valuable, if even one child can be saved from sexual violence, Thesleff says.
Leaders of Koreas or a gynaecologist from Kongo?
The President of the United States Donald Trump winner of the Nobel Peace Prize - the thought may sound weird at first, but, according to the odds, Trump is one of the biggest favourites to receive the prize.
This is due to Trump’s role in making North Korea commit itself to de-nuclearisation - at least in words.
Based on the odds, the biggest favourites for Nobel Peace Prize are South Korean president Moon Jae-in and North korean leader Kim Jong-un, who have met this year already three times and promised to try to achieve peace treaty between the two countries.
The thaw in relations between the Koreas is remarkable, because as recently as last year the relations were frosty.
Even so, awarding a prize to Kim, who has for years threatened with nuclear weapons and who leads his country with an iron grip, would undoubtedly cause criticism.
The Nobel laureates are revealed starting Monday, and on Friday is the turn of the prize that attracts the most attention: the Peace Prize.
If the Price is not awarded to participants of diplomacy on Korean peninsula, one of the top nominees is a Congolese doctor Denis Mukwage.
In his hospital in the Democratic Republic of the Kongo, the esteemed gynaecologist has treated thousands of women who were victims of gang rapes, and he has become the world's leading expert on his field.
With his work, Mukwege has drawn attention to sexual violence, which is a terryifying by-product of many conflicts.
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981, has also been considered to be a strong candidate.
Nobel Committee has revealed that this year there are 331 nominees for the Prize.
The names of the nominees are not made public.
Trump himself would not mind receiving a Nobel.
In May a reported asked him in White House, whether he feels he deserves a peace prize.
Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it, Trump smiled.
I want to get it finished.
The prize I want is victory for the world, the president continued referring to North Korea negotiations.
There are facts, however, that make Trump's Nobel unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee who decide on the award, has often awarded the prize to people and organisations that represent liberal democracy and multipolar world order - exactly such international co-operation Trump has has been seen opposed to.
In the 21st century three US politicians have received the Prize, all of them democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007, and Barack Obama in 2009.
Awarding Trump would mean a complete ideological reversal for the Nobel Committee.
A fire alarm in a tunnel: Motorists acted like behaved like lemmings, driving in the wrong direction
A traffic chaos on national road 1 at Lohja took place on 8 September.
The tunnel area traffic was halted because of the announcement to both Turku and Helsinki directions.
When the reason was discovered to be a system error, fire service attempted to normalise the traffic.
That did not happen very fast, though.
We attempted to open the road once before, but Traffic Management Finland said it cannot be done, because there are motorists spread out on the road, driving any which way, fire officer on duty Pasi Kääriäinen told to STT back then.
People were even driving the motorway in the wrong direction, after only a moment of waiting.
When the first one acts contrary to traffic regulations, a few other often follow, Contact Manager for Finnish Road Safety Control, Tapio Heiskanen wonders.
According to traffic regulations, stopping on a motorway or in tunnels is allowed only for a compelling reason.
Finnish Road Safety Control notes that one cannot danger the traffic in exceptional situations with rash decisions.
Emergency vehicles must always be given as unimpeded an access as possible.
It is particularly forbidden to drive in an opposite direction on a motorway, just like making a U-turn or reversing.
The same prohibition stands also in tunnels, where one must additionally always turn on the headlights.
In addition, stopping without a compelling reason is forbidden, as is naturally parking.
Some time ago there were even cases where the driver stopped in a tunnel to brush snow from his car.
It should be obvious that is a wrong time and place for such activity, Heiskanen says in a Finnish Road Safety Control announcement.
Ilves supporters would have wanted to continue their party even when the ship got stuck to the bottom of a lake
Ilves fans carried by lake ship M/S Tampere would have wanted to stay aboard and continue their victory celebration, even when the ship’s bow was stuck to the bottom of the lake, says Juho Syrjä, who was the captain of the ship at the time of the event.
M/S Tampere, on its way from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, drifted away from its route late Saturday evening, and its bow got stuck to the bottom of the lake in Akaa's Vanajavesi.
19 passengers and five crew members aboard were evacuated to the mainland during the night.
No one was hurt during the incident.
Ilves supporters would have wanted to continue their celebration aboard until morning, but naturally it was more sensible to send them to the harbour with the fire brigade and then back home in a bus, Syrjä told STT.
Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna to watch the match between Ilves and HPK, which Ilves won 4-3.
According to Syrjä, the Saturday accident was caused by the fact that water level at Vanajavesi was about 50 cm lower than usually.
Syrjä said that the navigation was also complicated by the closest channel marking being covered by gull droppings, which meant its reflectors were not normally visible in the dark autumn evening.
No noteworthy crash
Ship damage happened on the west side of Jumusensalmi shortly after the ship route had passed under the bridge between the Tampere-Helsinki motorway.
According to Syrjä, there was no bigger drama involved in the event, because the ship's speed was very low at the time of the event, and hitting the bottom did not cause any significant crash.
Syrjä says getting stuck to the bottom did not cause any leaks or dents to the ship, and it looks like the cruises can continue normally.
A diver checked the ship condition on Saturday morning, before the ship was towed from the shoal.
Just to be on safe side, we are going to the dock to check this caused no damage, Syrjä says.
Syrjä believes the next M/S Tampere cruise, booked for next weekend, can be handled as agreed.
The ship's cruise season continues until the independence day, he says.
No use for ambulances
Rescue department received an alarm about the event on Saturday evening little after half pas eleven.
Ambulances were sent to Viiala harbour to receive evacuated passengers, but there was no use for the ambulances.
Fire master on duty Matti Willman said late in the evening that the evacuation conditions at the lake were difficult because of darkness and relatively high winds.
Pirkanmaa rescue department reported on the night between Saturday and Sunday after half past two that all those aboard the ship had been evacuated and the passengers had been moved to Tampere by a bus.
The cruise ship built in 1957 has been renovated in 2001, 2014, and 2017.
Trump's justice nominee accused of sexual assault and drinking may be left without the top position
Brett Kavanaugh, nominated as a Justice to the Supreme Court, may well be left without the position he is pursuing, estimates programme director Mika Aaltola from the Finnish Institute of International Affairs.
So far at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour in his student days.
According to Aaltola, the suspicions have created so much pressure on the Republican party that president Donald Trump may decide to nominate someone else for the position.
Every now and then there have been cases in the United States that the president’s nominee for a Justice to the Supreme Court has caused plenty of disagreements.
Usually in these cases the justice nominee has withdrawn themself, Aaltola says.
This way the president has been able to save his face.
The nomination would benefit the Democrats
The Supreme Court of the United States attempts to stay above politics, but at least in the Kavanaugh case, the nomination of a new Justice has become an extremely sensitive process politically.
If Kavanaugh is nominated, Aaltola says it will most likely benefit the Democrats in the coming Congress midterm elections.
It would raise voting enthusiasm among young people and women, who are more likely to vote for Democrats.
On the other hand, nominating a conservative Justice to the Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for the Republicans.
There is no opportunity for a nomination every presidential term, because the United States Supreme Court justices are nominated for life.
In practice, some of them have retired at their own request around the age of 70 to 80.
Even some Republicans hesitate about the nomination
A background check is anyhow normally conducted of the nominees as Supreme Court justices, Aaltola states.
Even though Trump has set a time limit of only a week for the FBI’s further investigations, according to Aaltola it can still reveal something substantial.
Yes, it can.
There is rarely smoke without fire, Aaltola says.
According to Aaltola, one thing that is certain is that Kavanaugh's suitability or unsuitability for the position will come up in many discussions before the Senate makes its decision.
The Republicans have a Senate majority with 51 votes against 49, but at least two female Republican senators are suspected to have a doubtful attitude towards Kavanaugh nomination.
The most embarrassing thing would be if the nomination would be voted on, and the Republicans lost.
A woman has identified the Salisbury suspect as an agent of military intelligence
A Russian woman has told the BBC she recognises a Russian man suspected of the Salisbury poisonings as an agent of Russian military intelligence.
Based on photographs, the woman told the man in question is Anatoliy Chepiga who works for the military intelligence GRU.
Online community Bellingcat and Russian community Insider Russia earlier said they had revealed one of the men suspected of poisonings to be Chepiga.
Already earlier they said to have found evidence of the men's current identities are cover identities.
A BBC team travelled to the Far-East to the village near the Russo-Chinese border where Chepiga grew up.
A woman living in the village recognised young Chepiga from pictures published by Bellingcat.
She recognised the same men in the British police's pictures taken from a man currently calling himself Ruslan Boshirov.
The Russian men are suspected of poisoning the ex-double agent Sergei Skripal and her daughter with Novichok nerve agent in March.
The Skripals survived.
Colonel Chepiga has been awarded the order of Hero of the Russian Federation in 2014.
Russia still denies the suspect’s GRU connection.
Earlier in September, in an interview with Russian TV, the men said they were in Salisbury as tourists.
The elderly are defenceless in social welfare and health care reform
Now we have a real example about what social welfare and health care reform's change limiter, outlined by Sipilä’s government, actually means in practice.
My place of birth, Vaala municipality's social welfare and health care services are provided by Oulunkaari joint municipal authority. The health care manager of the joint authority is a former regional manager of Attendo, chosen in 2016.
The leaders of the joint municipal authority warn the municipal council about the change limiter.
If the social welfare and health care costs increase now, the municipality’s government subsidies will be cut in the future.
The municipality’s Centre Party decision-makers had a fright, and most of them are ready for the great structural change of services for older people, which would end the institutional care at the health centre ward and the small unit for those with memory disorders.
Home nursing would increase, which in Vaala, a place of great distances, means that the elderly living in outlying villages are uprooted and brought next to a health centre to be nursed “at home”.
Attendo trusted the municipality to pay for its customers.
The Vaala Left Alliance did not swallow the bad preparation, but organised a nice public event, attended by many family members, practical nurses, and also local councillors from other parties.
Using social welfare and health care county preparation slides, I showed how Vaala municipality already has the biggest number of elderly people nursed at home in the whole of North Ostrobothnia.
Carina Läntinen, a local councillor from a neighbouring municipality participated.
A local newspaper wrote an extensive story about the event, and this in turn made Oulunkaari draughtspersons’ hackles rise.
Social welfare and health care reform draughtspersons will not commit to writing that Attendo has built a new nursinghome to Vaala, and now it is empty, waiting for residents.
There are no other service providers.
The draughtspersons only talk about a service voucher, but they do not tell anything about the quality of treatment it will provide, or what is the staff structure Attendo will use when nursing the elderly until their terminal treatment.
Without a nurse?
The institutional care ward at the health centre is closed down because it has no doctor’s night emergency duty.
Also Attendo will rely on Vaala health centre’s doctors.
Vaala's example reveals how Centre officials whirl the councillors about with insufficient details, and put them over a barrel using the change limiter.
This is how the Centre Party empties Vaala of residents, because who will voluntarily stay and live an insecure life there, if there is a possibility to move away?
Was it one of the Centre Party's election slogans to keep the whole country populated?
Turkey’s President Erdogan opens a mega mosque in Cologne
In the German city of Cologne, thousands of people were protesting as the president of Turkey visiting in the country, Recep Tayyip Erdogan opened one of the largest mosques in Europe.
Several hundred people had gathered on the bank of the Rhine already in the morning.
‘Erdogan not welcome’, read in the protesters’ banners, and the slogans condemnded fascism.
There have been several protests during Erdogan's visit that began on Thursday, and the security measures have been strict.
Some 10,000 protesters were expected to take to the streets in Cologne to protest for example Turkey's human rights situation.
Erdogan supporters had gathered at the Cologne Central Mosque.
The police had however sealed off a large area near the mosque for security reasons.
In his opening speech, Erdogan said his German visit had been successful, estimating that it had strengthened the relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdogan met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
On Friday, Erdogan and Merkel swore they are rebuilding their countries’ relations that have worsened significantly after the 2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt.
Nevertheless, Merkel emphasised the fact that there are fundamental disagreements between the countries about for example human rights questions.
Criticism surrrounds the visit
Both Cologne mayor Henriette Reker and the North Rhine-Westphalia state premier Armin Laschet pulled out of attending the opening as criticism of Erdogan's visit grew.
Cansu, a 30-year-old student of Turkish origin came from Switzerland for the rally.
I want to be the voice of people who can't take to the streets in Turkey.
Because they have been arrested, killed or otherwise suppressed.
Erdogan thinks anything that differs from his opinion is terrorism.
Erdogan's German visit’s final stage takes him to North Rhine-Westphalia state, which is home to significant numbers of ethnic Turks.
Three people charged with a journalist's murder in Slovakia
Three people in Slovakia have been charged for the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
On Friday, a prosecutor said three people are charged with the murder of Kuciak and his fiancée that happened in February, and with other crimes.
Earlier this week, the police detained eight people in connection to murder investigation, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak and his fiancée were found shot to death in their home in Bratislava in February.
He had investigated the connections between politicians and Italian mafia.
The police has suspicions the murders are connected to Kuciak’s investigations.
The case and an article published by Kuciak have raised concerns about media freedom an corruption in Slovakia.
On Sunday, there may be problems with Karjalainen delivery on sparsely populated areas.
Due to a failure in printing, also the Sunday's Karjalainen has to be mailed unaddressed.
This can have an effect in newspaper delivery on sparsely populated areas, where the delivery to communal newspaper boxes has to be done from memory.
The situation was the same for Saturday's newspaper, and the proble may continue still on Monday.
The posting will add extra newspaper bundles to the region.
Newspapers of subscribers elsewhere in Finland will be posted separately labelled not until Monday.
These newspapers’ delivery will be significantly delayed.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
Journalist Arto Nyberg interviews for example Vesa Heilala in his talk show broadcasted live today.
Vesa is in the studio to tell about his oncoming trip to space hw reserved from Virgin Galactica already in 2010.
The price was 151,000 euro, and a bank loan was needed to cover it.
If the original plans would have held true, Vesa would have visited space already some time ago.
The departure date has been delayed year by year.
Now it seems that after the unlucky 2014 test flight that even claimed a life everything is in order.
If everything goes well, commercial flights begin this year or next year at the latest.
Vesa’s flight number is 300, so his trip will take place about a year after the first departure.
The flight takes 2.5 hours and 5 minutes will be spent in zero gravity up in a height of 110 km, the Finnish astronaut describes the future trip on his web site.
In the same address he also provides a background for his longing for space.
As a child, I read Star Trek comic magazine and saw Star Trek in television.
I've seen Star Wars films, and that's how the idea took root...
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a rude host
Mancester City continued its loss-free progress in the Premier League when it beat Brighton 2-0 at home on Saturday.
The marksmen Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero were the guarantees of the reigning champion team’s sixth win.
Sterling got to steer the ball into an empty net from a close distance, completing his fourth goal of the season, when Leroy Sané found him from the Brighton goal back post on the 30th minute.
Agüero raised his own goal balance to five, when he cut the Brighton defence to pieces together with Sterling on the 65th minute.
The Argentinian scored the 2-0 end result quite easily from the penalty spot.
City has began its season with six wins and a draw, leading the Premier League with its 19 points.
Liverpool is lurking only one point behind, though, and has played one match less.
On Saturday night Liverpool will meet the league third Chelsea in its own seventh round match.
The Finnish Youth Association selected new decision-makers in Joensuu
The Finnish Youth Association selected new decision-makers for its next triennial 2019-2021 in its assembly that finished on Sunday.
The new president is Anu Sivonen from Upper Savonia, and the new vice president is Petra Mäkeläinen from Tavastia.
40 ordinary members and 40 deputy members were chosen to the council, the Finnish Youth Association reports on Sunday.
The youth association assembly was held in Joensuu.
We want our cultural leisure activities to be known for their high quality and safety.
The assembly, organised in Joensuu, indeed gives three promises in its triennial operational objectives: Our doors are open for everyone, we organise equal leisure activities irrespective of background or place of residence, and we support voluntary activity and people on their own growth paths, the Finnish Youth Association says in its press release.
Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Räikkönen and was astonished about Ferrari: ‘They are losing a very important driver’
In an interview with a Swiss magazine Blick, the Mercedes’ British driver was asked whether he believes relieving Kimi Räikkönen from Ferrari employment would help Hamilton during the rest of the season.
Hamilton leads other Ferrari driver, Sebastian Vettel, by 40 points.
A bit under three weeks ago Ferrari announced the Räikkönen will not continue with the team next season, and at the same time Räikkönen announced his move to Sauber.
Naturally Hamilton doesn’t believe Räikkönen would throw in the towel.
I don’t think Kimi is going to change in the last races.
He is an extraordinary professional - a fantastic driver.
He remains one of my favourite drivers and I’m convinced that Ferrari is losing a very important driver.
It does not make sense to me.
Hamilton has earlier said that Räikkönen has been one of his role models.
I don’t know if Kimi knows this, but when I was young and dreamt about Formula 1, I used to play F1 on PlayStation all the time.
I was always Kimi, which is kind of crazy, Hamilton said in June.
F1 season continues on Sunday with Russian GP.
Mercedes’ Valtteri Bottas starts from the pole in the race that begins at 2 pm.
Iltalehti follows the race by the moment.
Football A-Junior League title match became a complete farce: the opponent arrived with only 7 players
The highest level of junior football ends on Saturday, when the last leg of the season is played.
Before the leg beginning at 1 pm, the starting points for the title match were plain: FC Lahti Akatemia only needs one point against Vasa IFK to win the title.
For the situation to turn around in the last leg, the second in the struggle for the title, Ilves, has to win PK-35 and hope for the Lahti team to lose.
Lahti team’s title was however practically certain already before start whistle, since Vasa IFK came to Lahti with only seven players.
If there were one player less from Vaasa, the match could not have begun.
FC Lahti Akatemia won the match 16-0.
At half-time, Lahti was leading 7-0.
One reason for the Vaasa player loss is that the team has in part used the same players for the A-Junior League (P20 League) and men’s Kakkonen (tier 3) Group C.
In Kakkonen, Vasa IFK has basically played the whole season against the threat of being relegated to tier 4.
During the final lef of Kakkonen on Saturday, Vasa IFK must win JBK in an away match and at the same time hope that Tampere United loses its own away match against KuFu at Toivala, Siilinjärvi.
A car ended up on its roof in Eno - according to the rescue department the people involved were lucky
A passenger car drifted out of the road and ended up on its roof on Juttuvaarantie, Eno, on Sunday around 9.
There were four people involved in the accident.
Two of them were slightly injured, the rescue department reports.
They were lucky, the report states.
According to the rescue department, the road was wet after a rain.
A police patrol visited the site of the accident.
Supo waits for new intelligence tools: Equipment purchases and recruitments already done, not a word being said on planned operations abroad
According to Supo Director Antti Pelttari, equipment purchases and staff training are preparations for the intelligence act.
Should intelligent laws come into effect, Supo budget would have a permanent increase of about 10 million euros.
The Finnish Security Intelligence Service (Supo) premises at Ratakatu, Helsinki, intensive preparations for intelligence law's entry into force are already ongoing.
Supo Director Antti Pelttari, who has a Centre Party background, tells Lännen Media there have already been equipment purchases for upcoming intelligence powers.
Serena Williams shocks singing topless in a video - campaigning for breast cancer awareness
Tennis super star Serena Williams causes a sensation again.
Now she is campaigning to raise breast cancer awareness by releasing an Instagram video in which she sings covering her chest with only her hands, AFP news agency reports.
The song is the 1991 hit by Australian The Divinyls, I Touch Myself.
With the video, Williams supports Breast Cancer Network Australia.
‘I’ve recorded a version of The Divinyls’ global hit “I Touch Myself” to remind women to self-check [breasts] regularly’, Williams writes in her Instagram message.
Yes, this put me out of my comfort zone, but I wanted to do it because it’s an issue that affects all women of all colors, all around the world.
Early detection is key - it saves so many lives.
The other writer of The Divinyls’ song is Chrissy Amphlett, who passed away from breast cancer five years ago at age 53.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself Project which was created in honour of Chrissy Amphlett.
‘She passed away from breast cancer, but gave us her hit song to remind women to put their health first’, Williams says.
The video has now been watched 1.5 million times.
It was published early on Sunday morning.
The video’s comments praise Williams about her courage.
Earlier this week, Williams dropped out from the tennis tournament in Beijing.
The reason for this is a stir in the U.S. Open tennis tournament three weeks ago.
Williams lost her temper with the chair umpire and, among other things, claimed that male players are allowed much more dramatic behaviour than female players.
A Chinese restaurant on a mountain path is not for those with a fear of heights
In addition to traditional Chinese delicacies, the restaurant serves amazing views.
An exceptional restaurant has been opened in Chinese province of Zhejiang.
It’s located literally on a ledge.
From there, it is possible to look at the forest spreading out below.
The wild scenery in the heights make the restaurant guests gasp in the Longquan mountains.
To reach the restaurant, one has to hike through peach trees.
The restaurant opened to the hikers on 19th September 2018.
YouTube comments wonder where the restaurant’s toilet is located.
A hike up to the restaurant requires good basic fitness level, people report from the location.
Korpelan Kujanjuoksu ends today: This is how everything ends
All good things must come to an end.
This is also true for the popular Finnish rural drama Korpelan kujanjuoksu (Korpela's gauntlet).
Third series has truly been in demand: last week’s episode premiere in television was seen by 722,000 Finns.
The top numbers don’t have any practical meaning as such, because there's going to be no continuation to Heikki Luoma and Jukka Mäkinen’s drama.
In the final episode, Jaska and Mirkku's relationship takes another leap forward, and Jaska’s mother probably is the first one to guess what is to come.
Anssi and Miisa’s relations are also warm, one could say positively romantic in the light of recent events, but the Laiho once again shows up.
Even the police is suspicious of the sneaky man.
Probably noone is however able to guess Laiho's fate in advance.
As for Anita, she hears unbelievable news.
Kauko's last will is broken, which brings the woman in the verge of tears.
A week from now, Sorjonen’s new episodes take the Sunday evening spot.
Korpelan kujanjuoksu on TV1 today at 9.05 pm.
Should you go to work tomorrow if you have the sniffles?
Here are the fact-based pros and cons
The flu season is underway.
Many are wondering whether to stay at home or not.
The hard workers should however consider, whether it is worth it to infect others, because the illness can be contagious, even though their own symptoms were minor.
Sometimes flu symptoms attack all of a sudden, sometimes they steal on you.
In the latter situation you may already infect others, even though your own symptoms would feel minor, Prevention publication describes.
Should you stay home then?
According to Prevention, before a person even experiences symptoms of the flu, they are contagious.
You can pass the virus from about a day before the first symptoms up until about five to seven days after.
Children with the flu may be contagious for longer than a week.
As soon as you are aware of any symptoms, you should not be in school or at work.
Return when you are no longer coughing and no longer have a fever, says medical professor Gregory Poland.
You should also avoid exercise.
Too quick a return to the gym can hamper the recovery.
Also be sure to wash your hands and sneeze or cough into a tissue and throw away the tissue.
Leaving home when ill?
If you must leave the house while ill, consider using a face mask.
The mask doesn’t filter out viruses, but it keeps the user aware of the head area.
When you wear it, you can't put your finger in your nose or mouth, Poland says.
Also sneezes are constrained with the mask.
How can you prevent infection, then?
The best way is still to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
It is hard to avoid the latter, though.
For example, the average American is putting their finger in their eyes, nose, or mouth every 15 to 30 seconds, Poland warns.
New Miss Finland follows the beauty queen tradition: ‘My spouse is an ice-hockey player’
Hockey players and beauty queens are often associated with each other.
This is true also for Alina Voronkova, 23.
Alina Voronkova, a native of Pertunmaa, is the 2018 recipient of Miss Finland’s crown.
Currently the beauty lives in Lahti, where she moved when she was 15.
Alina's mother is Ingrian and father Russian.
Voronkova was bullied at school because of her Russian father.
Mother and father moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was bullied about my Russianism.
I had no friends at Pertunmaa, Alina says in the announcement event for Miss Finland contest semi-finalists.
After secondary school Alina decided to start with a clean slate and move to Lahti to attend upper secondary school.
Soon the beauty queen found new friends and her daily life started rolling as desired.
When you’re 15 you think you're a grownup, but now, thinkin back, I really wasn't.
Three years ago Alina met his current partner Joonas Hurri, who is familiar from Pelicans.
After his league career in Finland, the hockey player has played abroad, like in Sweden and China.
In 2009, he was part of the Finnish team in the World U18 Championship.
In the early days of their dating the couple lived almost a year in a long-distance relationship, but later Alina had a chance to travel abroad with his spouse.
If I made it to the top three and I could make a living out of that, I don't want to believe it had any effect on our relationship.
Even though we would have to live apart, our trust in each other is good, and a good thing about a long-distance relationship is that the first spark never goes out, Alina grinned in May.
Happy about continuous growth with death on our heels
Nearly everyone is worried about the planet's ecological carrying capacity.
Yet people are not ready to give up practically anything.
Sustainable options for continuous growth are searched for, but even the theory of degrowth faces big problems.
During a few generations, the continuous economical growth has given ordinary people especially in the northern hemisphere a standard of living that could only be dreamt about in the past.
The prolonged breach of the planet’s carrying capacity together with climate change cause this foundation of market economy to sway threateningly.
Two men were stabbed during the night between Saturday and Sunday around 4 am at Sitratori, Kannelmäki.
One of the men, born in 1986, was seriously injured, and the other, born in 1968, suffered less severe injuries.
The older of the men has already been dehospitalised.
The police have arrested one person whose possible part in stabbing is being investigated.
The police is also searching for another suspect in relation to the incidents.
The incidents are being examined as an attempted manslaughter and grievous bodily harm.

We did a lot of mistakes during the first period, but luckily the Turku team goal brought us back in the game.
According to home team Inter’s head coach John Allen, the game was under control, but scoring pained us once again.
One defence mistake took the full points away from us, Allen regretted.

Lehterä demonstrated his short-handed skills, position not yet confirmed
Jori Lehterä's strong short-handed skills came up, when his NHL team Philadelphia Flyers had their final practise match before the start of the season.
Philadelphia won Boston 4-1, and Lehterä assisted Michael Raffl’s two goals.
These last few days Lehterä has been in the limelight because of drug suspicions.
On Wednesday, MTV reported that Lehterä is one of the 23 suspects in a narcotics case, where some are suspected of drug use, and some for example drug sales.
Lehterä has denied his involvement in the crime.
The team and the player have discussed the matter, and NHL is investigating the case.
Journalist Sam Carchidi from Philadelphia Inquirer, which closely follows the Flyers, estimated after the match that Lehterä is one of the group of six forwards, five of which will have a spot in the NHL team.
According to Carchidi, Lehterä was excellent in the practice match.
In the second period while playing short-handed, Lehterä fought the puck for himself, drew a defenceman’s attention and passed the puck to Raffl, who had an clear shot waiting in front of the goal.
The second time the duo managed to score a goal was right in the end of the match.
Flyers begin their NHL season on October 4 playing away against Las Vegas.
In Boston, defenceman Urho Vaakanainen waits for the team's coaches to decide, whether he is in the NHL group or not.
I think the practice camp was good.
I did my best, and can be proud of this.
Now the coaches decide, whether I can play.
I believe I am ready for NHL, Vaakanainen said in an interview published on Boston’s Twitter account.
Vaakanainen, who began his hockey career in Jokipojat, playd 19.31 minutes against Philadelphia.
Tuukka Rask at Boston’s goal surrendered four times and saved 20.
Vili Saarijärvi, defenceman originally from Kärpät, scored 1-0 for Detroit while on powerplay, as the team won Toronto 5-1.
Playing for Calgary, Ilves-originated defenceman Juuso Välimäki got an assist, but Edmonton beat Calgary 4-3.
Oilers rested Jesse Puljujärvi and goalie Mikko Koskinen, among other.

A fresh picture shows the change: The world's strongest man lost dozens of kilos
Eddie Hall, winner of the World’s Strongest Man in 2017, is going though a striking transformation.
British Eddie Hall hunted the title of the World’s Strongest Man with a determination for a long time.
Hall would eat up to 10,000 calories worth of food in a day, and at his peak would weigh in at 200 kilos.
His shirt size used to be 5XL.
Before winning the title, Hall admitted to doing damage to his body.
Human body isn’t designed to be this size, Hall said.
The brit hunted the title of the World’s Strongest Man every which way, and the family man promised to end his career, should he win the title.
Hall didn’t want his children to grow up without their father.
Hall kept his promise, and he wasn’t seen in the 2018 World’s Strongest Man competition, organised in April.
Recently Hall published an Instagram picture where he poses considerably lighter than during his active career.
Hall writes his current weight is 169.5 kilos.
He wrote he now has five cardio sessions a week.
They include for example boxing, cycling, and swimming.
Hall also does four gym sessions a week.
This year the title of the World’s Strongest Man was won by Icelander Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson, also known from the TV series Game of Thrones.
The previous Finnish winner of the competition is Janne Virtanen, who was number one in 2000.
Restaurant ship M/S Tampere ran aground at Pyhäjärvi - ‘Firmly stuck in the rocks’
Lake ship M/S Tampere ran aground at Pyhäjärvi, Akaa, late Friday night.
The rescue department received an alarm about a water traffic accident on Friday evening little after half past eleven.
A 30-metre M/S Tampere had ran aground, and its bow is firmly stuck in the rocks, described the fire master on duty, Matti Willman.
The ship had 19 passengers and five crew members aboard.
According to the rescue department, there were no injuries.
All the passengers and almost all crew members have been evacuated to the mainland.
Now they are being transported to Tampere in a bus, said the manager on duty, Jari Nieminen, to STT after one o’clock in the night.
Ambulances were sent to Viiala harbour to receive evacuated passengers.
For some reason, the ship, on its way from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, had drifted away from its route on the west side of narrow Jumusensalmi.
The police investigates the reason for the accident.
Fire master on duty Matti Willman said earlier in the evening that the conditions at the lake are difficult because of darkness and relatively high winds.
According to the rescue department, the ship’s fate is unclear.
Apparently the ship does not have a leak.
After the evacuation operation, divers will check the situation in the lake bottom.
M/S Tampere, built in 1957, is a lake ship currently operating as a restaurant ship. Its passenger limit is 180 persons.
The ship also has a conference room available for rent for private use.
According to the ship’s website, the cruise ship has been renovated in 2001, 2014, and 2017.

Ex managers demand unpaid fees from Robert Helenius
A disagreement about money overshadows boxer Robert Helenius’ tonight's match against Erkan Teper.
Ilta-Sanomat reported today on the complaint by boxing manager Jaakko Helminen and Master of Laws trained on the bench Jussi Kokkila, in which over 80,000 euros worth of unpaid manager fees with penal interest are demanded from Helenius.
According to the complaint, Helminen and Kokkola worked for Helenius between 15.4.2014 and 30.1.2015.
We have attempted to settle this, but there is no other option.
There was a clear assignment here, and a lot of work has been done, Kokkila says to Ilta-Sanomat.
Helenius’ current manager, Markus Sundman, sent Ilta-Sanomat a repsonse, which narrates the boxer’s view of the events.
Helenius denies to have an obligation to pay the required sum.
As stated in the response, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services to Helenius in a financially difficult situation, and promised to be able to organise matches and sponsor income for him.
According to the verbatim agreement, Helenius was obligated only to pay a percentage of his matches as fees.
Again and again there were assurances that Helenius does not need to pay anything, just to receive the income they organise.
This is also a normal and only practice in professional athletes’ managerial action.
There never was an agreement about paid work, and that would also have been ill-advised in Helenius’ situation, Sundman explains in a message he wrote.
There never was a written agreement about the co-operation
According to the response, Helenius would have wanted to agree on the income distribution in written from the beginning, but Kokkila and Sundman did not manage to make a draft until the end of 2014.
He discovered the draft to be bad for him, and discontinued the co-operation with Kokkila and Helminen.
Helenius had no matches while associating with Kokkila and Helminen.
A year after their co-operation ended, Helenius received an “unspecified but big” invoice for manager work.
This year a complaint was filed with the same allegations.
Helenius regards Helminen and Kokkila's subsequent action as cowardly, the response states.
Today Helenius faces Erkan Teper, the seventh from IBF heavyweight contender list, in a match in Stuttgart.
An amiable man and a good journalist
Artist and music producer Ilkka ‘Ile’ Vainio knew the late radio host and journalist Erkki Pälli for decades.
A seasoned radio host and journalist Erkki Pällli passed away of terminal liver cancer aged 83.
The host's obituary was published in Sunday’s Helsingin Sanomat.
The obituary says Pälli died on 3 September.
Pälli shared his serious illness on his Facebook page in March 2018.
Back then the announcement was seen also by Ile Vainio, who grieved the news about a friend's destiny.
In a way he said his goodbyes already earlier in Facebook, Ile Vainio said.
Vainio says Erkki Pälli was a multi-talented professional, who became an excellent journalist.
He remembers Pälli as a popular person, quick on the uptake and telling funny tales.
I’ve known Erkki since I was a small boy and went to Finnlevy the first time as a 12-year-old to start working at their warehouse.
That is when I met Erkki.
Back then he worked as Finnlevy publicist and had different duties, Ile Vainio remembers.
As I was promoted to a music producer and made records, there were hundreds of events where Erkki Pälli was present as a regular journalist to write stories about the artists.
He was always well-informed and I saw the passion he had for entertainment, music, and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he managed to get close to his interviewees.
He was an amiable man and a good journalist.
Many knew him as a respected Yle radio host, but he also wrote excellent articles.
Many time Erkki interviewed also me.
He was a good speaker, Vainio applauds.
Over decades, in addition to journalist work, Pälli also worked at Fazer record company together with Toivo Kärki.
He was the music producer on Vesa-Matti Loiri’s records.
However, Pälli’s greatest passion was radio work, which he did with his own, unique style.
He worked in the radio since 1960s, and became familiar to many listeners from Yle's ether.
Pälli retired in 1998.
Finnish Ski Association announced on Saturday that the association’s financial period that ended in May recorded a profit of about 450,000 euro.
The association describes a ‘complete reversal’ of their economic situation, even though their finances are certainly strained by ‘significant debts in the balance’.
Executive Director Mika Kulmala praises their fast reactions and stringent economic discipline.
Last autumn, we responded quickly to the situation and made adjustments.
Careful planning of operations and financial control are instilled in our whole organisation, Kulmala says in the press release.
We have also succeeded in partner acquisition, and in addition the profits from the world cups were maximal during the past season.
However, we must continue to be careful when managing expenses, and at the same time we must constantly look for new forms of financing.
I heard my wife cry for help, but then silence
Dozens of bodies lie in the hospital courtyard in the city of Palu, located on Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Only one building separates them from the area, where the injured survivors are gathered in order to evaluate their injuries and need for treatment.
The patients are also treated outside because of the aftershocks.
One of the people moving in the hospital area was a 52-year-old Palu resident Baharuddin, who was searching for his son.
Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
I have one child, he’s missing.
I last spoke to him before he went to school in the morning, Baharuddin told news agency AFP.
Dwi Haris, who was lying outside the hospital in Palu, had suffered injuries in his back and arm.
When the earthquake began, he was in a local hotel with his wife and daughter.
The family had been invited to Palu for a wedding.
I was probably caught under a collapsed wall.
I heard my wife cry for help, but then silence.
I don’t know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe, Haris told news agency AP, according to British media.
Small shops are looted
In Palu evacuation centre, 35-year-old mother of a small child Risa Kusuma attempted to calm down her feverish baby.
She described the city atmosphere as tense.
There is little clean water.
Small small shops are looted everywhere, said Kusuma.
Many Palu residents have slept outside or in temporary bamboo huts.
Even though their homes would still be somehow standing, the possible aftershocks could destroy them for good, burying the residents.
According to news agency AP, over half the prisoners in Palu prison escaped after the prison walls collapsed.
Reportedly there were about 560 prisoners, so there are perhaps about 300 fugitives.
The Jakarta Post reports that also a part of Donggla prisoners have escaped.
According to the newspaper, the prisoners got into a rage and set fire to the prison after the guards had forbidden them from leaving to search for their relatives who had suffered from the earthquake and the tsunami.
Palu airport has been re-opened mostly for relief flights.
One of the first to land on the airport was a military C-130 transport aircraft bringing relief items.
Commercial flights to Palu airport are allowed only to a limited extent.
The pilots had to land to the airfield without air traffic control, because the control tower was badly damaged in the earth quake.
A rain sweeps over Finland during the night
A long area of precipitation spreads over the country from the west during the night between Saturday and Sunday.
The rain will be mostly water, but in central and northern Lapland sleet or snow can be expected.
Last night’s biting cold is not going to repeat, since the temperature will remain warmer under the cloud cover.
An overcast night keeps the lowest temperatures quite effectively under control.
The temperature may temporarily drop below zero in the far west, the meteorologist on duty, Ville Ilkka said.
On Sunday the area of precipitation will turn eastward during the morning.
The weather will be fair or partly cloudy in the south and west.
In the afternoon the temperatures up to Oulu latitude are between 10 and 13 degrees.
As to temperatures, the coming week looks to be similar in the southern and central parts of the country, but the weather will be more unsettled.
Wind and wave warning are in effect on the sea areas.
There are no actual autumn gales to be expected in the next few days, but otherwise it will be a typically changeable autumn weather.
It really looks like is going to be a real autumn now, Ilkka said.
Miss Finland final won’t be seen on television
IL-TV allows you to follow the red carpet glamour and glitter from Miss Finland competition.
Iltalehti entertainment journalists host a live broadcast at IL-TV from the red carpet of Miss Finland final at Billnäs ruukki.
The broadcast begins around 6.50 pm.
A new Miss Finland is chosen from the ten finalists on Saturday.
Miss Finland 2018 final is organised at Billnäs ruukki in Raseborg.
Before the final begins, you can follow the atmosphere on the spot via IL-TV live broadcast.
The live broadcast begins around 6.30 pm and continues for about an hour.
This year especially many Miss Finland winners from previous years have been invited to the final.
They are represented in the jury by Miss Finland 1998, Jonna Ziprus.
Other jury members are well-being sector entrepreneur Jutta Gustafsberg, photographer Nadi Hammouda, Jounin Kauppa CEO Minttu Murphy-Kaulanen, and Seiska news producer Katja Lintunen.
We hoped she would be admitted to the university before going to a beauty contest
Russian father Dimitri and Ingrian mother Svetlana had faith in their daughter’s success in Miss Finland final.
Parents of the new Miss Finland Alina Voronkova, Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkova, were proud following their daughter’s first moments wearing the crown.
They arrived to audience from Pertunmaa, and planned to drive back home after the final.
The spirits were wonderful!
We believed in Erika the whole time, but half an hour before the results we were beginning to be nervous, Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana is Ingrian and Dimitri Russian.
Alina speaks fluent Russian, even though she has lived her whole childhood in Finland.
Svetlana says that as a small child, Alina was interested in acting and many other things, rather than a beauty queen career.
People were often commenting that Alina is so pretty she should be a beauty queen.
But she said she wanted to be a radio host.
It wasn’t until later Alina got interested in beauty contests.
The parents hoped Alina would be admitted in the university before participating in Miss Finland contest.
This became true, and finally Alina wanted to complete her Bachelor’s degree before beauty contests.
We kept asking already last year why she won’t participate, but she wanted to complete the Bachelor's.
The parents believe Alina won because she is a wholesome example for young people and for adults, too.
She exercises a lot and eats a healthy diet.
And Alina likes to be in the limelight, it shows.
Alina’s boyfriend Joonas Hurri is a professional ice hockey player in Japan, and he wasn’t able to come to Finland to support his dearest in the final.
Alina’s parents believe the pair’s relationship will withstand the year as Miss Finland.
It is meant to be!
The parents hope their daughter would visit them soon.
Now there's been a long break in visits because of the Miss Finland activities.
We miss her already, even though we have sent her messages.
A young man died in a running over - police seized three people

Neither did the police comment on whether the seized people and the man who died in the running over knew each other from before.
Additional information on the case will be available in the beginning of next week the earliest.
Sari Piippo left her career in Brussels and became a stay-at-home mother in Finland - got an idea of a comic and lack of drawing skills did not slow her down
Luomuhömppä (‘organic silly’) originated from an utterance of my husband, when he suggested it could be a person in a story I was developing, describes Sari Piippo, a comic blogger from Espoo, stay-at-home mother, and former EU translator.
Sari Piippo says she was an EU-translator in Brussels concentrating on economy and law, until the family’s fourth child was born ten years ago and they became returning migrants.
I’ve loved being a stay-at-home mother.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point I started to wonder what to do when I grow up, and even my youngest one started to be pretty big.
Then in 2014, comic came in.
Piippo says she had never even dreamed about making a comic, even though she had been reading Donald Duck, Tintin, and Asterix ever since she was little.
I hadn’t drawn since childhood, but when these scripts for Luomuhömppä then started to emerge, the situation changed.
First I created some dozens of scripts for my own pleasure.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (b. 2000) is a skilled drawer, but I didn’t manage to persuade her to help me until summer 2016, when I bribed Viivi with a drawing tablet.
Her enthusiasm lasted for about a dozen strips, and then I had to start trying myself, Piippo laughs and says the drawing tablet was a great supporter for her.
A drawing tablet is an easy and handy way to try to get something done.
I didn’t even try to draw on a paper, Piippo describes her relationship with drawing, which she usually does in the evenings.
Scripts pop up in my mind all the time, but usually I never finish a comic at one go.
A single three-panel strip may take even several hours.
I may do one panel at a time and I love to play with colours.
Beginning to draw is always the most diffficult thing, since drawing isn’t my forte.
Sari Piippo says that when it comes to modern comics in newspapers, she appreciates for example Dilbert by Scott Adams.
Characters of Luomuhömppä include a carrot-figured mother, obsessed with everything organic and head full of lettuce hair.
Other characters are Mies (Husband), Pissis (Teen Girl), and Kaksoset (Twins).
In the world of Luomuhömppä you are what you eat.
The ideas for the comic come from the creator's own life and social media.
Sari Piippo does not want to preach or force any ideas, even though there are occasionally more serious subjects in Luomuhömppä.
Piippo says she has her husband and children read the comic.
It’s a really great feeling to look at a comic you’ve drawn and think that this is what I did today.
There's challenge enough for a stay-at-home mother!
Luomuhömppä comic is available online at luomuhomppa.sarjakuvablogit.com

Indonesian earth quake: An air traffic controller sacrified himself - didn’t leave a fractured tower until he managed to save hundreds of travellers
A 21-year-old air traffic controller Anthonius Gunawan Agung has become a hero of Indonesian quake.
Agung stayed alone in an ATC tower until he managed to saw off a passenger plane carrying hundreds of people from the island being shaken by the quake.
The young man was on duty in the air traffic control at Palu's Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport when the earth quake struck on Friday.
As others fled the ATC tower, Agung refused to abandon his post until he got a Batik Air passenger plane off the ground.
This way he might have saved hundreds of lives, Indonesian aviation authority AirNav told AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport on Saturday after the quake.
The ATC tower trembled and cracked.
Eventually, Agung jumped from the fourth story of the tower in a bid to escape.
He broke his leg and suffered serious internal injuries.
Agung was taken to a nearby hospital.
He was to be taken to a better-equipped facility, but died 20 minutes before a helicopter could arrive, a representative of AirNav told The Jakarta Post.
After the flight was safely in the air the quakes became ever stronger, culminating in a 7.5 magnitude jolt.

Rehn pondered the possibility of Europe escalating in a trade war at Yle “We must see the next tweet”
The trade war between the United States and China is reflected in the world economy as a whole.
Growth forecasts have been lowered throughout Europe, and also the Bank of Finland has slightly lowered its own economic growth estimates.
Speaking at Yle Ykkösaamu, Governor Olli Rehn said that even though increasing tension has no direct effect on European flow of trade, it does weaken the trust, which in turn is reflected on companies’ investment decisions.
The same applies to the impacts of Finnish companies’ exports.
Rehn thinks so far Europe has taken good care of its duties.
It has been able to create a truce with the United States, and, for its part, calmed the situation down also with China and Japan.
Rehn does not think that Europe will be ground under the feet of a trade war.
We must see the next tweet and make estimations after that.
Our partner in Washington is quite unpredictable, he however said in the Yle interview.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of them is the third largest euro area economy Italy, which is also one of the most indebted states in the euro area and the whole Western world.
The market had a severe reaction to a budget showing a clear deficit presented by the Italian government on Thursday evening.
Next year's deficit is over 2.4 per cent of GDP.
Rehn considers Italian situation to be alarming.
Five per cent of the country’s loan stock are problem loans, and over ten per cent are unregulated loans.
In addition, the public finances are shaky, and again it seems that the country is going to exceed its liabilities in relation to its European partners.
Maybe we should not yet be imagining new crises, Rehn replied when inquired whether Italy is leading Europe to a new economic crisis.
Another matter taxing Europe is British departure from the EU.
Rehn hopes it can be settled at peace.
A quarrelsome exit would have much more negative effects.
Rehn began as the Bank of Finland Governor in July.
European Central Bank (ECB) President Mario Draghi will retire in a bit over a year.
The discussion about his successor has begun.
Both Rehn's and his predecessor Erkki Liikanen’s names have been brought up.
It probably is all right, if there are Finnish names involved, Rehn said, adding that he has no further comments on the matter.
Helsingin Sanomat newspaper's super popular Musta laatikko (Black Box) performances continue again next week - last tickets to Helsinki are for sale
Popular Musta laatikko performances organised by Helsingin Sanomat (HS) continue again next week.
Other performances are in the National Theatre on October 2, 8, and 11.
October 23 Musta Laatikko visits the Tampere Theatre for the first time.
There are still some tickets left to the National Theatre.
Tampere performance is sold out.
Tickets available via Lippu.fi.
During the evening, the journalists and photographers on stage share a true story they have been preparing for a long time, and which has never been published in any HS medium.
Again there will be something no one has ever heard.
‘There is a strange spy in Helsinki night, an impressive report from other side of the globe, and a moving story about a very topical health-related issue’, describes Esa Lilja, one of the Musta laatikko producers.
After the show, the audience has a possibility to meet HS journalists and photographers to continue the discussion.
Helsingin Sanomat has organised these evenings of living journalism for three years.
They have been popular from the beginning, and tickets are often sold out.
Already over 15,000 people have visited the auditorium.
Musta laatikko was awarded as the journalistic act of the year in Bonnier gala.
The award committee praised this new way of journalism and the journalists’ willingness to come close to their readres.
Spring 2019 Musta laatikko is in the National Theatre in March and April.
The show also visits Tampere and Turku.
The show then will have a different content than the evenings this autumn.
A missing mushroom picker found thanks to an ‘unconventional experiment’
The Finnish Police's drone skills are the top of the world: ‘We are asked to provide training’
According to the Director of the Police University College, in addition to looking for missing persons, the police can use a drone in crime scene investigation and in intelligence operations.
On Tuesday, using a drone, Oulu police found a missing mushroom picker in Raahe in only a few minutes.
The Director of the Police University College, Kimmo Himberg, tweeted about the case and mentioned for example that ‘thanks to unconventional experimenting and efficient training, we are at the top of the world also in this’.
Drone is a fairly new device, and even newer in police operations.
There are no statistics available about Finnish police being a master in drone use.
According to Himberg, there is a wide consensus about this.
This has been obvious for example when Finnish police's experiences have been reported in international events.
There is a lot of interest towards it elsewhere, Himberg says.
There are many, who are are keen to visit Finland to see the police’s drone operations.
We are asked to provide training.
Becomes more and more common
Himberg points out that in Finnish winter conditions, finding a missing person as soon as possible is vital.
As stated, in Raahe case the missing person was found in just a couple of minutes using a drone.
Finnish Police has already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
According to Himberg, the plan is to train more.
Already now the drone is used a lot in police operations, and their use will increase and become more common in the future.
I dare to say this, Himberg says.
In addition to finding missing people, Himberg says the police can use drones in, for example, accident or crime scene investigation and in certain kinds of intelligence operations.
For example if an area must be reviewed from a distance, if there is a possible threat of violence there.
In these cases, a drone can be used for advance inquiry.
Karjalan Rugby promoted to the first division
Karjalan Rugby celebrated their 2nd division win in Kuopio on Saturday.
During the halftime, the Joensuu team was still losing 7-12 to Helsinki Rugby Club, but during the second half they started to get the hang of the game, defeating their southern guests 26-12.
The 2nd division title also means that Karjala Rugby will be promoted to the first division, a historic event.
The team has played in the first already before, but back then Finnish rugby series was divided into two levels, FC series and 1st division that had several groups.
The team plans to accept the league status, but it means a lot off work for next winter.
The current player roster of less than twenty players must be increased to 25.
1st division also means more games and longer game trips, so the funding must be organised accordingly.
Kotkaniemi to begin his season in Montreal, head coach confirms
The head coach of NHL team Montreal Canadiens, Claude Julien, confirmed on the team’s Twitter account that the Finnish forward Jesperi Kotkaniemi begins his season in Montreal.
Montreal reserved the prodigy Kotkaniemi, 18, during the first round as number three in the summer’s Entry Draft.
The forward joined Montreal practice strength in the late summer, and has perfomed well in the September practice matches.
Kotkaniemi managed to score in his very first practice match.
The head coach Julien said the Finn has taken big development steps since he arrived at the rookie camp.
NHL season begins next week the night between Wednesday and Thursday Finnish time.
Montreal faces Toronto Maple Leafs in the opening round.
What is a good leader like?
This week Finland has heard a lot of discussion about leadership.
Chairman of Nokia, Risto Siilasmaa, discussed his book Transforming Nokia that deals with his leadership philosophy in an interview for Helsingin Sanomat (HS).
At the same time he criticises his predecessor chairman Jorma Ollila's leadership style.
Ollila categorically denied the claims, but also earlier reports on Nokia have discussed the leaders’ inability to work as a team; the culture of fear and silence that in part caused the downfall of the mobile phone business.
The risk-taking capacity and agility of the company's rise period were lost.
This week also saw the business life mega event Nordic Business Forum organised in Helsinki. The event gathered the cream of Finnish business to Messukeskus.
In addition to the main star Barack Obama, 12 stars of business world were seen on the stage.
There was a lot of talk about good leadership.
Leadership theory legend Gary Hamel said that a good leader must have the courage to take a company to the future also when everything is going fine.
The problem is that decisions are made by those, who are most mentally bound to the decisions of the past.
John Mackey, the founder of Whole Foods supermarket chain known for its extensive organic product selection, said a leader has to be able to convey the company meaning to the whole staff.
And that meaning has to be something more besides simply making profit for the owners.
Author of a successful book on introverts, Susan Cain explained research has proven the most successful leaders to be humble.
They act in a peaceful, quiet, and determined manner.
Often they are introverts.
Professor of Finance Aswath Damodaran reminded the listeners that a good leader's characteristics must match the company’s life cycle stage.
In the early stage of the company a leader must be able to tell a story on which the company's future is founded.
A company grown to a mature stage needs a leader who know the numbers.
These lessons were attended by 7,500 Nordic Business Forum visitors - mostly Finnish leaders.
They were at a risk of an information overload.
Being a good leader requires a lot.
That is why leadership so often fails, also on the highest level.
Siilasmaa and Ollila were also present.
They had a friendly discussion behind-the-scenes.
Though they were hardly contemplating whether they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And their humility was not easy to estimate as an outsider.
Stunning Sara Chafak arrived at the red carpet straight from Los Angeles - spends most of her year abroad
Model Sara Chafak arrived at beauty contest final in a stunning black dress.
The fantastic dress of Miss Finland 2012 also had a lacy train.
I have a slight jet lag.
I came from Los Angeles again.
I pretty much spend most of my time there, Chafak tells her news.
Chafak says she goes to auditions in L.A.
She has done for example commercial shoots.
She describes her work in the States as interesting, and also similar with what she does in Finland.
She does however say that it’s important to work even harder, because it’s easy to find a replacement for a model.
You must push harder and be aggressive, Chafak says.

Danish police found the Volvo searched for in a large operation: ‘We cannot disclose where’
Danish police’s extensive hunt has paid off.
In the beginning of the operation, the Great Belt Bridge and the Oresund Bridge were closed to the traffic.
All overland and ferry traffic from Zealand island to Sweden, Germany, and other parts of Denmark was suspended.
The police was looking for a Swedish-registered Volvo V90.
IS spoke with the shift manager from Copenhage police media centre.
The missing car has been found.
We cannot yet disclose where the car was found, says Henrik Storm form Copenhagen police communications to Ilta-Sanomat.
According to Storm, the police does not believe the missing black Volvo has no direct connection to the threat.
According to him, the biggest danger is over.
Danish Ekstra Bladet reported the police press briefing on Saturday.
The officer in charge of the investigation, Jørgen Bergen Skov, kept silent about the progress of the operation.
He did not want to tell the category of the offence for the investigated case.
Skov did however say it is a ‘serious crime’.
It was a matter of threat to human life.
Three people have been searched for during the operation.
The police do not say whether they have been already caught.
According to the newspaper, the ferry service limitations have been cancelled.
The Copenhagen police followed the events also via their Twitter account.
STT reports that according to the police, the general public has no reason to worry, because the threat was directed at certain people.
The name of Macedonia has been a cause for disagreement for decades - now the nation votes on the issue in a quarrelsome vote
Macedonia, located in the Balkans, is currently voting on the proposition for the country's new name.
According to a deal between Macedonian and Greek governments, the name would be Republic of North Macedonia.
So far Greek has vetoed Macedonia’s bids to join NATO and EU.
According to Greece, Macedonia is the name of its northern region.
The question in the referendum does not mention a new name, but inquires whether the voter support Macedonian membership in EU and NATO by accepting the deal.
The voting had a slow start at least in a school located in the centre of capital city Skopje.
A retired nurse Olivera Argirosvka, who voted at the school, hoped that the deal gains support.
Referendum means change, if it opens the doors to Europe and to NATO.
It means change especially for the young people, she said.
In official communications, the name used for Macedonia, independent since 1991, has been the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev’s government has campaigned for the ratification of the deal.
The nationalist right wing opposition, including the President Gjorge Ivanov, have encouraged people to boycott the referendum.
In addition to the result, there is the the voter turnout to wait for: whether it will be over the required 50 per cent.
The referendum is not binding, but if the yes votes win, it would give a mandate to change the constitution.
To change the constitution, a majority of two thirds in the parliament is required.
The Greek parliament also has to ratificate the deal.
The polling stations are closed eight o’clock in the evening Finnish time.
A handsome victory!
Robert Helenius knocked out Erkan Teper
Late Saturday evening Robert Helenius faced Erkan Teper in a heavy weight professional boxing match in Germany.
The 34-year-old Finn competed with his 36-year-old German opponent in Waldenbuch located near Stuttgart.
The main match of the evening was the IBF heavyweight Intercontinental title match.
The winner may have a chance to fight in matches tougher than the one on Saturday, with a significant financial importance.
Helenius resolved the match in the eighth round, when he knocked Teper out with his hard left hand punch.
Teper was unable to get up from the mat.
‘Nordic Nightmare’ hurt his opponent already in the third round, when the German’s nose started bleeding.
This was Helenius and Teper's first encounter in the ring.
They were supposed to fight already in December 2015.
Back then Teper pleaded injury and pulled out of the match.
After that it transpired that the German had been busted twice in a doping test.
During his professional career, Helenius has taken 28 matches and lost twice.
Teper, a clear favourite in the match, has won 19 professional matches in his career and lost three times.
Hamilton won by a team order - gap to Vettel already 50 points
Formula one championship title is yet closer to its confirmation, as Mercedes’ Lewis Hamilton won the Russian GP and stretched his lead to Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel to already 50 points (306-256).
There are only five races left.
Valtteri Bottas, who had the pole position, drove to second place.
Last year in Sochi Bottas took the first win of his career, and this time retained his lead for the opening half, but then Mercedes ordered Bottas to let Hamilton pass.
Vettel was third, Ferrari’s Kimi Räikkönen fourth.
Red Bull's Max Verstappen started from the last row but was fifth.
A pair assaulted a man from Juuka in Joensuu - were caught a block away
Two men assaulted a 31-year-old man from Juuka by hitting and kicking. The incident took place around Siltakatu 12 in Joensuu on Saturday after 6 pm.
According to the police, the men also stole the victim’s phone, among other things.
The police reached the suspects, a 35-year old man from Heinävesi and a 39-year-old man from Ilomantsi, a block away soon after the incident.
They were seized under suspicion of robbery, the police reports.
The victim was bruised, but the injuries did not require a visit to a doctor.
CEO of electric car manufacturing company Tesla, Elon Musk, steps down as chairman of the board for the company.
Musk settled the matter with US authorities.
Musk has also been fined 20 million dollars for his tweets, in which he claimed he had secured funding for taking Tesla private.
United States’ Securities and Exchange Commission SEC has sued Musk for securities fraud.
Musk still continues as Tesla CEO, but the company also has to pay a $20 million fine, if the settlement between authorities and Musk is confirmed in court.
Canada is racing against time to reach an agreement on Nafta with the U.S.
Time is running out in the negotiations on free trade agreement Nafta between the United States and Canada.
The United States set the deadline for Sunday, and the countries’ negotiators have had intensive discussions through the weekend.
Canadian head negotiator, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland postponed her address in the United Nations General Assembly in order to fully focus on the trade negotiations.
At President Donald Trump's insistence, the United States, Canada, and Mexico started the negotiations to reform the North American Free Trade Agreement Nafta about a year ago.
In the end of August, Mexico and the U.S. reached a bilateral understanding, but so far there has been no agreement with Canada.
The United States and Mexico want to validate the agreement before the winner of Mexican presidential election, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador takes office in the beginning of December.
Trump has said it’s not essential to include Canada in the agreement.
Earlier he notified the Congress that the plan is to sign the agreement in the end of November - whether Canada is involved in it or not.
Because of these schedules, the text of an agreement between the U.S. And Canada has to be ready on Sunday, so the United States Congress has enough time left to evaluate it.

The police seized 11 people after the match between Honka and HJK - rowdiness on the field and in a metro station.
The police seized eleven people on in Espoo on Saturday after a men's football league match between Honka and HJK, confirmed Detective Inspector Teemu Värtinen from Western Uusimaa Police Department to the Finnish News Agency STT.
The rationale for apprehension was protection from offence and disturbance.
The apprehended were released after the situation had calmed down, said Värtinen.
The apprehensions were earlier reported by Ilta-Sanomat.
The match ended in a goalless draw.
After the final whistle, a great number of spectators rushed to the field from the section reserved for HJK supporters.
The situation escalated into pushing and shoving as well as fist fights between the two teams’ supporters.
Mounted police officers were also needed to stop the situation.
In addition to the football field, there was some brawling going on in the area of a nearby metro station, where some of the apprehensions also took place.
I was not present, but what I could see from the pictures, it was an unpleasant situation, Värtinen referred to the pushing and shoving on the field.
According to Värtinen, there have been no criminal complaints done after the events.
Pöytäkivi chased his Finnish butterfly record in the world cup, also Laukkanen swam to finals
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Pöytäkivi made it to the finals in the closing day of Swimming World Cup's competition 3/7 in the Netherlands.
The short-course meets are held in Eindhoven.
Pöytäkivi from HSS chased his Finnish record in 50m butterfly, placing second in the preliminaries with a time of 22.82.

Students act a rare treat: a classical tragedy - simple Oresteia impresses with its visuality.
Classical tragedies are a rare treat on Finnish stages.
For example, there has not been a classical tragedy in the Finnish National Theatre since Sophocles’ Philoctetes in 1998.
Now Theatre Academy takes the only complete classical trilogy, Oresteia by Aeschylus, to a tour that begins from the National Theatre.
Beginning in 2015, the Lavat auki! productions have actor students from the Theatre Academy working internationally together with a professional director.
This fourth production, just like the first one, is directed by Mikko Roiha, who resides in Berlin.
Oresteia had its international premiere in Berlin in April.
Roiha’s adaptation of Oresteia laudably condenses the tale of how the curse upon the doomed House of Atreus is lifted and a constitutional state is formed to 80 minutes by condensing especially the chorus parts.
The playmanages to be quite faithful to the spirit of Kirsi Simonsuuri’s excellent translation (2003).
Dramatic lights and presentation revealing the sides of the theatre space emphasise the simple and clear stage thinking.
In the centre of it alternates the dynamics between actors playing main roles, stepping forward from the chorus in turn, and the chorus.
The performance utilises both double and triple portrayals of the main roles.
The actors never leave the stage, so also for example the murders of Agamemnon, who returns from the war of Troy, and his prize of war, Cassandra, are shown on the stage, unlike in the classical tradition.
Of course the performance does not even claim to be faithful to the classical performance tradition.
If anything, the viewer is presented with a modern interpretation, faithful to the text, and continuously aware of its ritual-like roots.
Roiha has managed to create a rhythmic group from the Master-level actor students, a group that performs as a tight-knight team, even as a single organism.
The chorus parts especially are where the actors and their very expressive, sculpture-like group formations do themselves justice in the bare stage adorned only by a white curtain.
Impressive.
Oresteia's performance tour continues in Kouvola and Oulu Theatres.
Korean manufacturer making its first hydrogen lorry
The new model will be seen in Europe especially due to a co-operation agreement between Hyundai and Swiss H2 Energy.

We continue to develop the fuel cell technology even further with this project, first of its kind in the world.
We will continue to seek opportunities for expanding these lorries into other markets by for example monitoring fuelling infrastructure, Hyundai Motor’s Executive Vice President In Cheol Lee said in the agreement’s launch event.
Fists were doing the talking on several occasions in Kajaani
A man in his thirties assaulted three men in a restaurant in the centre of Kajaani and in front of it on Saturday after midnight.
First the man hit a man inside the restaurant, after which he was removed from the premises.
Outside he pushed another man to the ground, and as a third man intervened in the situation, the attacker hit him, too.
The police seized the attacker.
The man continued to act in an aggressive manner in the police station, kicking one of the police in the leg.
The man also threatened to assault and kill the police.
The man was taken into police custody to calm down.
The incident is investigated as three assaults and a violent resisting of an official in the performance of his duties.
Also another assault took place on Välikatu in the centre of Kajaani on Saturday after midnight.
A victim was assaulted by two men.
First a Kajaani man in his twenties hit the victim.
A while later another man knocked him down, and the man who earlier hit him further kicked the victim.
Outsiders pulled the attackers away from the victim and the police was called.
The offenders however managed to leave before the police arrived.
The police asks the eyewitnesses to contact Kajaani police by phone 0295 416 520 or by email at tutkinta.kainuu@poliisi.fi.
A long-term radio host Erkki Pälli has died
Erkki Pälli, known as Yle's long-time journalist died of cancer aged 83.
Radio host Erkki Pälli, 83, has died.
He passed away of terminal liver cancer he told about on his Facebook page in March 2018.
This is the end now.
Even the doctor has said it, I live one day at a time, he commented his situation to Iltalehti a month ago.
The security of ladies and men in shops must be guaranteed
The first time I was paid for a newspaper story was in 1984.
With this level of experience, when a news story manages to astonish me, it is usually a big thing.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27.9.) about the insecurity of workers in retail, I was astonished and occasionally even a bit angry.
For that story, I also talked with Erika Kähärä, Service Union United (PAM) specialist in working environments.
She says the crime statistics do not reveal the actual situation.
This is a growing problem, even though employers naturally claim otherwise.
The police are informed only about those cases that are clearly serious, and many real violent situations are left unreported.
‘Based on the Occupational Safety and Health Act the companies certainly have a responsibility to compile statistics of their close call situations, but these statistics are for internal use only, and their information is not collected anywhere’, she said.
The mental injuries are not included in the statistics.
Violent situations always have had the problem that there do not always result in physical injuries.
Despite this, psychological traumas can be much more severe than bruises and cuts.
It is difficult to draw a line between a violent situation and an impending violent situation, since also aggressive threats of a certain level must be considers as violence - even though there was no physical violence.
Too many are afraid at their workplace, even though no actual violence would happen.
Some neighbourhoods are troubled.
The shop has hired security guards.
When the business opening hours became deregulated, there was a lot of discussion also in the media about its effects to the salespersons’ safety.
‘Back then quite a few employers organised security guards for at least the night-time hours and to prevent working alone’, Kähärä commented.
When nothing happens, wrong conclusions are drawn.
This seems to have had an effective influence, but this brings about a new negative trend.
When security managed to control the disturbances, an impression was created that this security would be unnecessary.
Now many places are looking for solutions to eliminate expensive security services.
Petty assault is an actionable offence, and it is quite understandable that an assaulted salesperson does not want to make a request for investigation about an offender who usually lives close to the shop.
But, according to a subsection in the same 2011 act, petty assault is under a prosecutioner’s jurisdiction, if it takes place in a workplace.
I think we need precedents now.
The next time a shop lady or man is assaulted, the police should investigate and the prosecutor prosecute.
After a court would put a few assailants to prison, and if the judgement is from the tougher end of the penal scale, the manners would smarten up.
A society that requires a small place food shop to be open nearly day and nigh should guarantee the safety of shop assistants.
Heidi Sohlberg taunted a beauty queen before live broadcast - ‘Sara, remember that Iiro is married’
This year, the beauty queen coronation won’t be seen traditionally on TV, but it’s broadcast via Viafree site.
The show will be hosted by ex Miss Finland, Heidi Sohlberg, and the host of Viasat's and Viaplay's NHL and KHL studios, Iiro Harjula.
The host for backstage and red carpet is Janni Hussi.
Before live broadcast, the host trio informed the invited guests and media representatives present about how the broadcast will progress.
In the beginning, Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harjula resounding applauds.
Scream now, ladies!
Look at our male host, Sohlberg enthused over her colleague while the audience cheered.
Many Miss Finlands from earlier years follow the contest from the first row.
Among others, Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi were sitting next to each other, and Sohlberg cracked a joke to either of them.
Sara, remember that Iiro is married!
Sohlberg cracked, looking at Saras.
Most likely Sohberg directed her joke to recently divorced Sieppi, who laughed at the comment, even though she first looked confused.
Sieppi discussed her divorce the first time in Ilta-Sanomat weeked newspaper.
The beauty queen said she doesn’t want to publicly open up about the reasons for the divorce, because that is just between her and Roope Salminen.
She said she’s in no hurry to find a new relationship, but that she is going to focus on herself.
I will focus on my own things, and above all, will begin to live my life by myself, Sara Sieppi said.
Harjula's marital status emerged also later, when Sohlberg accidentally called Janni Hussi and Iiro Harjula a couple.
The host trio shared a laugh at the blunder.
Wasn't Iiro married, or how was it?
Janni Hussi acknowledged the mistake.
An Ostrobothnian man tortured his domestic partner by slashing, burning and feeding a strong sauce to her
Pohjanmaa (Ostrobothnia) District Court has sentenced the 34-year-old Kokkola resident to three years of imprisonment for the numerous crimes against his domestic partner.
The means of commission of the offence include, among others, a belt, a cable, and cable ties.
The court sentenced these objects forfeited to the state.
The most severe charge concerned a suspected aggravated rape.
This charge was however dismissed by the district court.
The Kokkola man was considered guilty of four assaults, and aggravated assault, coercion, illegal threat, deprivation of liberty, aggravated deprivation of liberty, and two malicious damages.
The crimes were committed between the 26th of last March and 24th of last May.
After the final deeds, the man was apprehended and detained a couple of days later.
On Thursday of the past week, Pohjanmaa District Court passed its judgement and ruled that the 34-year-old must continue to be kept in Vaasa prison.
No proof about the rape
The 34-year-old was also accused of two aggravated deprivations of liberty and of an aggravated rape on the 22nd of May.
The court however dropped these charges as unsubstantiated.
The case was tried behind closed doors.
The district court judge gave a public report on the sentence, though.
According to the district court judge, the accused had directed violence, threatening, and coercion to his domestic partner in situations where she was tied.
The accused slashed his victim with a knife, burned her with a cigarette, fed her strong sauce, and poured water and coffee on her.
With its sentence, the court ordered that the means of commission of the offence were to be forfeited to the state: a belt and a cable, cable ties, a bathrobe belt, a knife, and a billhook.
Four witnesses
According to the district court, the parties continued living together between the deeds.
The judicial decision states that a large number of the most serious deeds happened in the end of the crime period.
Four witnesses were heard in the court, two women and two men.
The 34-year-old must pay 5800 euros as compensation for pain, ache, suffering, and temporary damage.
Doubtfully he has such money, since the convict already has earlier debts in collection.
The imprisonment is not the man's first.
Iltalehti will not publish the name of the convict in order to protect the victim’r privacy.
During the time of writing, the recent district court sentence is not non-appealable.
Europe in a four-point lead to Ryder Cup finals
European golf professionals strengthened their lead against United States in the traditional match play game on Saturday.
Europe leads 10-6 in Ryder Cup played near Paris, when there are still twelve Sunday twosomes coming.
Europe won three of the four four-ball matches that began Saturday, and in the afternoon foursomes the wins were shared 2-2-.
European guiding lights were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all the four matches they played as a pair during Friday and Saturday.
Earlier no European pair has reached a feat like that.
On Sunday the twosome attempt to make more history.
No European player has won five points in a single Ryder Cup, and only three Americans have managed such achievement: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK condemns its supporters violent troublemaking in the match against Honka: ‘Violence does not belong to football’
Veikkausliiga premier division football team HJK issued a press release on Sunday, denouncing its supporters disruptive behaviour in the match against FC Honka in Tapiola on Saturday.
‘On behalf of our supporters, we apologise the events that took place after the Honka-HJK match’, the press release states.
After the match, circa 50 HJK supporters rushed to the field, and some seemed to be trying to start a fight with Honka supporters.
And a fight also broke out between the supporters.
Security officers did not manage to calm the situation down, but police officers and also mounted police officers were needed.
HJK's press release states the team players and officials are shocked about the incident.
The after-match incidents are against the values of our long-established team of 111 years.
‘We absolutely dissociate ourselves from all such activity that endangers the match safety’, the press release declares.
HJK promises to aid the authorities and event organisers in investigating the potential elements threatening safety, and in removing unwanted side effects.
Fan culture is a part of football and an important thing to HJK.
We will in every way support positive, happy, and encouraging activities in football stands.
‘Violence is not part of that’, the press release says.
A Philippine inventor flies with a drone car - this is how you avoid traffic jams
Mendiola is a Philippine inventor, hip hop dancer, and a Gyro Gearloose of some sort.
He is one member of the growing group who swear to have invented a flying car - or at least their own version of it.
He has competitors such as Audi and Airbus.
However, Mendiola does not believe in the mass manufacturing of his vehicle.
According to reports from from the world, he has used a great deal of his fortune to build his dream.
Six years ago he began developing his flying car.
Now he calls his development version a dron car.
He says he recently conducted the first successful test flight - he floated in over seven metres with his machine.
One of his goals was to avoid traffic jam.
I hope the machine evokes positive reactions.
Five years ago this was just a dream, Mendiola said according to British Daily Mail.
JHL anticipates: Industrial action beginning tomorrow will be visible in children’s daycare and in social and health services
Overtime and shift-trading bans beginning tomorrow in the public and welfare sectors concern especially social and health services and children's daycare, estimates Päivi Niemi-Laine, President of JHL (the Trade Union for the Public and Welfare Sectors).
The impact will be wide, and it will most certainly manifest in not having enough staff available.
Everyone has to think about how to collect their children.
The employer’s task now is to take care of the services and that no one’s life is in danger, Niemi-Laine says to STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the lack of employees was visible also in the beginning of the year, when JHL members were banned from overtime and shift-trading because of agreement negotiations.
Through their flexibility, the employers have made possible to not hire staff, but use employees’ overtime or shift-trading.
This is not yet an industrial action.
When talking about occupational safety and health, it is a normal thing to take care that each employee has regular working hours and works only those regular hours.
With these actions, JHL opposes the governments attempts to weaken the lay-off protection in small businesses.
Labour market director for municipal employers Markku Jalonen will not estimate the effects of overtime and shift-trading bans in advance.
However, he does not believe them to be very revolutionary, even if the services can weaken.
Employers around Finland are aware of this and have made the possible preparations.
The public, welfare and technical sector covers such a wide area that it is difficult to say anything.
The effects can very quite a lot depending on field, region, and employer, Jalonen told STT.
Jalonen said some experiences were received already last week when the Finnish Union of Practical Nurses Super and the Union of Health and Social Care Professionals Tehy, among others, organised similar three-day actions.
Their effects remained quite small.
JHL overtime and trade-shift ban applies to for example employees in municipalities, church, and state, as well as in private social and health sector.
For example family daycare providers have been excluded from the ban.
At this stage, the industrial action applies to nearly 100,000 JHL members.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL actions can potentially last for a long time.
The union is prepared to take other industrial actions, if drafting of the lay-off bill continues.
The government should now recognise that they are running against a wall in high speed.
In Jalonen’s opinion, both the trade union movement and the government must meet the other halfway.
The unusual thing here is that people are already pulling out their big guns, even though the proposition has yet to be made, wonders Jalonen.
Great Barrier Reef is formed by children and adults - performance exercises consist of learning the motions of a ray and a sea horse
Great Barrier Reef by Other Spaces collective had its premiere last spring in Hamburg, and last Saturday was its second performance in Finland, this time in Kanneltalo.
Just like the previous performance of the group, Great Barrier Reef is a performance that is created together with the audience from the beginning until the end.
This time, however, also a more clearly-defined performance is formed to refresh and distil the perceptions from the beginning exercises.
There is plenty of fantastical magic in this theatre play also for children participants.
A child’s view has been considered also in the preparatory stage of the performance.
Still, Great Barrier Reef is not a children’s performance, but a performance formed in co-operation between the adults and the children.
It gives the adults knowledge and observations about the way children receive information and create art.
The children’s ability to throw themselves in the exercises and common games also dispels the distance between grown-ups and children.
Great Barrier Reef has a little bit of a fairy-tale ballet, circuit training, and nature-themed lesson in it, but its final setting is organised around different visits to non-human situations.
Great Barrier Reef begins with learning about corals and about movements of organisms and fish who live within the reef.
Six different exercise groups teach for example about the motions of a ray and a seahorse.
Finally a performance lasting a little under an hour is formed, and in it the music, lights, shiny paints and costumes help in getting to know the life within the coral reef.
In Great Barrier Reef, the participants are both diving people observing the life within the reef, and corals that are being observed.
They also play the part of organisms observing corals.
The looks at many different directions and perceptions create a performance that is dense and teeming with life.
To be an organism’s view, and organism observing a view, or an organism or view observing another organism - and all this at the same time.
Children seem to have no problems to do this.
Other Spaces collective’s exercises aim to reach the limit between thinking and action, but it is challenging to reach it when the group is comprised of both children and adults.
On the other hand, children’s participation makes it more meaningful.
After the workshop, a silent demonstration for endangered corals is organised at Sitratori.
One should not let themselves be hardened by the destruction surpassing human understanding, even though it can be difficult to understand the significance of practising one’s own compassion in the face of these visions of destruction.
Other Spaces has created its performance in such a way that it honours the variety of life also with a political gesture.
There are also other generations, other consciousnesses, other species and their future generations it clears the way for.
Children grow up too fast - I’m happy there were no smart phones when I was a child
Present-day children and young people are more and more irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking when they’re younger and younger.
I think children should be children thoughout their childhood, and not mess up their lives because of intoxicants and sex, because all the others say they are doing that.
I was taken aback, when my friend told me she had had to pick up her fifth-former sister from her ‘boyfriend’s’ house during weekend.
When she came to get her drunken sister, she told about her sex experiences from that evening.
I could’ve not imagined my own sister in the same situation, because throughout our childhood we've been told and advised that we should not touch intoxicants and sex is an adult thing.
I hope present-day children could live a proper childhood, and they wouldn’t need to grow up too early because of the peer pressure created by friends.
I keep seeing younger and younger girls on Instagram, wearing make-up and revealing clothes in their pictures.
Snapchat is used during evening to take and send revealing pictures.
It is more and more difficult to guess, which age the girls are.
Present-day 13-year-olds can easily look like they’re 18 or even older.
My childhood consisted of playing in the forest and boardgames.
I’m happy there were no smart phones when I was a child.
I got to be a child for many, many years, and I didn’t have to wonder what others think about me.
Yle: Official have told the political leaders that the case Airiston Helmi has nothing to do with national security.
In an interview with Yle, Ilkka Kanerva said Finnish Security Intelligence Service and Finnish Defence Forces came to inform the Defence and the Foreign Rights Committees earlier this week.
The Finnish state leadership has been told that Airiston Helmi investigation currently has nothing to do with national security, but organised crime, Yle reports.
The anonymous sources’ information was confirmed to Yle by the Chair of the Defence Committee, Ilkka Kanerva (National Coalition).
According to Kanerva, the Defence Forces and the Security Police visited the Defence and the Foreign Rights Committees to tell about the ongoing investigation.
This is primarily considered as financial crime.
They were rather strict about not speculating about anything else, Kanerva commented in the Yle interview.
According to Yle information, the attached material so far has not shown any connection to national security, but the investigation is just beginning.
We have no way of knowing what might yet be revealed, one of Yle's interviewees stated.
The extensive house searches started a week ago in the Turku archipelago and on mainland beg the question about whether the investigation is simply about financial crime or if it has something to do with Finnish internal security.
Earlier this week, Iltalehti put together an article scrutinising the allegations both pro and con.
Video: a dream goal saved Liverpool from the first loss in the series
Liverpool winning streak in the Premier League came to an end, but it was still the happier team after a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge.
This Sunday it will be exactly one year after Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and left with a 1-0 away win.
Back then Pep Guardiola’s combination sent a signal to the whole Premier League that City is now serious.
Everyone remembers how the last season ended.
And surely Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp had the same idea when coming to West London.
The Reds had started the League with six consecutive wins.
Liverpool had a stronger start, and especially Virgil van Dijk seemed to control his end of the field alone.
As for Chelsea, on Wednesday they won a fine Football League Cup away win on Anfield Road.
Then Eden Hazard came off the bench to decide the match with a beautiful individual performance.
Obviously now Hazard was playing from the very first minutes.
On the 25th minute he first played a tight triangle with Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
Finally the Croatian saw Hazard rushing forward and sent him a perfectly balanced through ball.
Hazard strayed a bit to the edge of the penalty box, but from there managed to sweep a perfect left-footed volley in to the lower corner.
Pool's Brasilian goalie Alisson was a bit slow with his save and only managed to touch the ball with his fingertips.
Klopp must have felt the losing position being slightly unfair, since almost right after Antonio Rüdiger cleared Mo Salah's shot from the goal line.
In the second half, also Chelsea keeper Kepa saw some serious action.
Basque goalie had a quick reaction to Sadio Mané’s shot, and pushed the ball from the foot of the goal post to a corner kick.
As for the other end, Alisson resetted Hazard's fast break with his dive.
The guests’ best chance came on the 72nd minute, as James Milner's crossing found Bobby Firmino.
However, the star Brazilian's header was directed towards his national team mate David Luiz, which saved the home team's lead.
Even that didn't hold anymore on the 89th minute, when substitute Daniel Sturridge had a free shot from 25 metres.
Sturridge was playing on his old home stadium, and to honour that, the forward threw a powerful shot in the upper corner.
Liverpool's winning start of the League came to an end with the 1-1 draw, but it still holds the top position - together with Manchester City.
Chelsea is also still going for the championship with only two points from the top.
Discussion about clock switching divides the people
I remember some decades ago a newspaper asking several Finnish influential persons what divides Finnish people.
Only response I remember was Juice Leskinen’s: ‘Nen’ ending.
Some surnames have a ‘nen’ ending, some do not.
Dividing lines can spring up anywhere, and this was one of the possible reasons.
In EU, Finland has achieved that this annual clock changing is about to become history.
Many agree that switching clocks twice annually has been simply foolery, and that it has caused many problems.
In the end, this achievement seems to be the easiest part of the solution, even though it has not been that easy.
The most difficult part now is to choose the ultimate time: current summer or winter time, or some other time zone.
The people can also have their say on otakantaa.fi site.
The online survey has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications, and it will be open until Friday 12 October.
Discussions are heated both around coffee tables and in social media, and everyone has something to say about the matter.
Those favouring winter time justify their opinion with the effects of morning sunlight to peoples’ well-being, and those defending summer time with the effects of evening light on peoples’ will to spend time outside and that way to their well-being.
Both sides have solid supporters and good arguments.
According to research, morning light sets the pace for a person’s day and increases energy levels.
On the other hand, if a person does not particularly suffer from waking up when it’s dark, light increases the time people spend outside and better enables for example autumn yard work.
The amount of extra light hours after a normal work day has already been calculated.
I would rather take both, but it’s unlucky that we cannot help our location in the northern corner of the Earth.
The winters are anyway too dark, the summers too light for many people.
It is typical for discussions about this matter to support one’s own views and oppose the other side very uncompromisingly.
There is no need to listen to the justifications of the opposing side, since the most important thing is how one feels about the matter.
Since almost everyone has an opinion about this matter, it is somewhat pointless to try to change someone’s mind.
It is effort well wasted.
It is easy to have an argument about this topic, since it does not require to really go into details, and an opinion is justification enough.
These kinds of topics are generally those, who incite most furious, and most futile, debate.
Obviously it will be annoying if a wrong option is chosen, but we will surely reconcile ourselves with it.
And, should life feel too glum, it always offers a suitable scapegoat.
Josba fought a narrow away win
Josba's first away game in floorball First Division against Nurmo’s Jymy resulted in full three league points.
Josba returned home from Seinäjoki with a triumphant 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory.
In the beginning of the third period, Nurmo was still a goal ahead, but Josba experimented with line-ups and rotated players.
In 50.47, brothers Eetu and Juuso Lehtiniemi plotted the 6-5 winning goal.
As both teams got penalties, many crucial minutes were played with even strength.
The most effective Josba player was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2+1).
The second chain had a good firepower anyway, as Teemu Tuhkanen (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) all scored.
Also Miika Kosonen (1+0) played in the second chain when he scored.
After three league rounds, Josba has six points.
The next opponent is O2-Jyväskylä in an away match in two weeks.
Eno church celebrates its bicentenary on Sunday
Eno church bicentenary is celebrated tomorrow on Sunday, for some part in a very sad atmosphere.
Kiihtelysvaara church arson a week ago was a shock.
Also Eno church was guarded on the two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, today is a day of celebration.
Even if noone would want it to be so, Eno church is now the oldest church in the Joensuu parish union.
The church on a hill in the centre of the village has always been the heart of Eno, despite all sorts of municipal and other mergers.
A family service begins at Eno church at 10 o’clock today.
After that, a Karelian banquet table is set at the church hall.
There is a lot of different things happening during the day, both inside and out.
It is possible for example to visit the church building guided by retired sacristan of 37 years, Ari Räsänen.
Church birth celebration also is an end of an era.
The church hall, built in 1982 and already taken out of use, will keep its doors open for the last time today.
Currently we have temporary facilities at the old municipal hall, chaplain Markku Kostinen says.
The church hall was destroyed by indoor air problems, but the church has been healthy in place for already 200 years.
Elon Musk steps down as chairman of the board for Tesla - Fraud charges settled with $40 million
Electric car manufacturer Tesla and the company’s CEO Elon Musk have settled their case with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC, who regulate the U.S. securities industry.
SEC suspected Musk to be guilty of a securities fraud, and Musk was in danger to be removed from the management of the company he founded.
However, Musk is allowed to continue as Tesla CEO.
Instead, Musk has to step down for three years as chairman of the board for Tesla.
The company has to hire an outside chairman.
Musk will also be under stricter supervision.
According to the settlement, Tesla will have to appoint two independent directors and oversee Musk’s communications in the future.
In addition, both Tesla and Musk have to pay $20 million (ca. 17 million euro) to settle the case.
‘The resolution is intended to prevent further market disruption and harm to Tesla’s shareholders’, says SEC co-director Steven Peikin.
The case began in August, when Musk tweeted that he could take Tesla private.
He also wrote that funding has been secured.
This tweet caused Tesla’s stock price to rise temporarily.
SEC suspected Musk guilty of a securities fraud.
According to SEC, the tweet was false and misleading, and Musk had not discussed the deal with the company’s other directors or potential financing partners.
In practice, SEC charged Musk with misleading the investors.
On Friday, SEC announced it is going to sue the company and Musk.
SEC told it is seeking to impose fines on Musk and to ban him from being able to hold officer or director positions at publicly-traded companies.
SEC’s summons scared the investors, and Tesla's share took a nosedive.
Over 800 people died in an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
The death toll from Indonesia's quake and tsunami disaster has soared to at least 832, the disaster agency said according to news agency AFP.
The number of deaths is believed to grow higher, since the investigation of damages is till ongoing.
Vice President Jusuf Kalla predicts the death toll could reach into the thousands.
An earthquake on Friday triggered a tsunami that surged over the Palu city in the island of Sulawesi.
A warning about a tsunami was issued right after the quake, but it was quickly cancelled.
According to officials, nearly all the known deaths are at least so far from Palu.
The rescue officials are worried about the Donggala area close to the quake centre, where the situation is for the most part unclear.
Already now several people are known to have died.
Cries of help from the ruins
The Indonesian army has been called to aid the rescue workers in searching for victims.
President Joko Widodon, who arrived in the destruction area today, asked the troops to be ready to work day and night.
One of the focus points of the rescue work is a Palu hotel, the ruins of which are suspected to still hold 50 to 60 people.
Muhammad Syaugi, head of the national Search and Rescue Agency managing the rescue work, said that one people has been pulled out alive from the ruins of Roa-Roa hotel, popular with business travellers.
We also heard people calling for help, he said.
Syaugi said heavy lifting equipment is now quickly needed in the quake and tsunami area.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media in order to find their missing family and friends.
Help, you in Palu and nearby.
My friend’s family members are still missing, one of the writers pleaded in a Facebook group.
Politicians’ phone numbers leaked to troublemakers in Britain
Many British politicians were subjected to nuisance after their personal details were leaked because of an app security flaw.
The troublemakers had access to e.g. Ministers’ phone numbers.
The app in question was a mobile application used for Britain’s Conservatives’ party conference.
For example Brexiteers Michael Gove, Secretary for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson were among those targeted for disturbance.
Several ministers received nuisance calls.
Because of a security flaw, members of the public were able to access the politicians profiles in the Conservative party annual conference’s mobile application.
They could enter the profiles using a politician’s email address, which is widely available online.
The person entering a profile could view and edit the data stored within.
For a brief moment, someone managed to swap Boris Johnson's profile picture for pornography and change his job title to a libellous one.
Michael Gove’s picture was changed to one of media tycoon Rupert Murdoch.
Dawn Foster, a columnist for The Guardian described the problem by writing that the conference app allows one to log in as other people with their email address.
After that it is possible to view the contact details in a person’s profile and, for example, send messages as them.
The conference app essentially made every journalist, politician and attendee’s mobile number public, Foster criticised.
A Conservative party spokesperson apologised for the breach.
They said the technical issue has been resolved and the app now functions securely.
The Information Commissioner's Office ICO investigates the breach.
The application was created by an Australian Crowd Comms company.
Opposition party Labour criticises the Conservative party saying they cannot be trusted in security issues.
The Wall Finland quiz show's audience has a huge number of applauding Poles every week
The sharp-eyed viewers paid attention to the studio audience reactions in The Wall Finland quiz show.
The American television format The Wall has spread quickly worldwide, and its Finnish version arrived at channel Nelonen last Saturday.
Hosted by Heikki Paasonen, the game show has been filmed in Poland in the same studio, where the other international productions of the format are made.
The shooting possibilities of the studio in Poland are exceptional, because the format's tall, 12-metre game wall requires a generous space.
During the opening episode, social media highlighted the show's studio audience, which people guessed to be Polish.
There was a Twitter discussion about whether the possible Poles sitting in the studio understand anything about the game played in Finnish.
Unne Sormunen, managing director of Finnish programmes at Nelonen, explains the issue to Iltalehti.
She says the studio audience consists of the players’ close friends, other Finns, expatriate Finns living in Poland, and Polish viewers.
The Finnish production audience consists of international applauders, just like the audiences of other countries’ The Wall episodes, filmed in the same production space.
Finald also has these groups, the so-called professional audiences that visit different programmes’ shoots, Sormunen explaines.
She reminds people that following the game is not so difficult to understand, even if one does not understand the language it is played in.
It is easy to separate the red and green balls falling from the wall.
However, there are interpreters present in the studio to translate for those speaking a foreign language.
There are two interpreters who interpret simultaneously everything that happens to the studio floor manager.
The manager then gives instructions to the audience and describes for example what kinds of jokes people are telling and what is the current situation, Sormunen says.
She compares the situation with how things were done recently with David Hasselhoff in a Finnish production.
Some years ago, David Hasselhoff was involved in Talent Finland filming here in Finland.
He had a continuous simultaneous interpretation coming to his earbud the whole time, and he knew everything that was said in Finnish, Sormunen summarises.
A typhoon that battered the southern parts of Japan proceeds towards the main islands - official warn about landslides and flooding
Officials also warn about possible landslides and flooding.
At least 50 people have been injured in typhoon Trami, but the official say there have been no major injuries and there is no information so far about fatalities.
In the southern island of Okinawa, the winds were so strong they upended cars.
According to Japan Broadcasting Corporation people have been evacuated to shelters, and there are over 300,000 households without electricity.
Over a thousand flights have been cancelled, and high-speed trains have in places come to a standstill because of the storm.
The storm is ecpected to hit near Osaka around noon Finnish time.
The capital Tokyo is not directly on the path of the storm, but strong winds and rain have been promised there, too.
Trains have been cancelled in Tokyo today.
According to meteorologist, Trami will continue to torment Japan until Monday.
The sky gets even cloudier for Ässät
The beginning of the season has been a bad one for Ässät.
The situation is already almost pitch black, as the team lost to Vaasa Sport on their home ground by 3 goals. The final score was 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1).
The Pori team now has had five consecutive losses, and a point total of two from six games.
None of the defensemen or players from two lower strings of the team has made a goal.
And the pressure keeps building.
When playing against Sport, the crowds started to leave the hockey arena already when there was still about half of the game left.
We’ve only played six games, and there’s no reason to give up.
We have to be worried though, since our game was that bad.
Especially performance during second period was shamefully bad, describes Jarno Kärki, who made 1+2 points for Ässät.
Sport naturally enjoyed their victory.
The team had a previous game on Friday, so that could have had an effect on their playing.
And maybe it did, but Ässät just didn’t manage to capitalise on it.
Bread day visitor number continued to grow
The mother of Bread Day, Pirkko Hyvärinen, marvels at the attendance in the big hall's auditorium.
Somehow I thought there would perhaps not be that many people this year, Hyvärinen thought in the morning.
In the autumn of 2017, Bread Day was organised at the same time with Finnish plowing contest, so maybe the expectation was that the attendance could even go down from the year before.
But unlike expectations, the aisles were crowded already before ten, the sellers said their products were sold out, new crop porridge was sold more than last year, nearly 500 portions, and Hyvärinen heard there had also been a rise in the number of cars.
The attendance estimate has been about 6,000, Hyvärinen says later in the afternoon.
During the five hours in the morning and afternoon, the programme had especially many things for families with children, which probably was the reason why there was a record number of them present.
Hyvärinen also estimated the event reaches people from even further distances.
Every year, the sellers also come to Liperi from a larger area.
This year, there were nearly a hundred sales representatives, handicraft, pastry, and harvest product sellers in the bread parish.
The mother of Bread Day, Pirkko Hyvärinen, marvels at the attendance from the hall auditorium.
The Bread Day began with a harvest blessing.
Teija Kiviniemi's beautiful bread won the public vote in the children's category.
There were 11 breads of varying shapes in the children’s bread competition.
The winner of the rye bread competition, Marjatta Vepsäläinen, spent the day at the Martha organisation's pastry workshop.
7 most beautiful lights - this is how you recognise a good lamp
Bring the space to life, create an appropriate atmosphere to the decor, and read a book without tiring your eyes.
It is worthwhile to invest in good lighting.
We collected three good reasons to investi in lighting.
The tips came from Innolux Director of Sales and Marketing Tarja Jokiniemi.
Do a favour to your eyes
The importance of lighting grows together with age.
Sufficient light can help in those problems many people get when they age, as visual acuity decreases and more and more suffer from glares.
As one gets older, also the need for light grows.
A person in their sixties requires three times the light than a person in their twenties.
It is worthwhile investing in the therapeutic effects of light and in lamp qualities already for health reasons.
A good lamp gives enough light but doesn't cause glares, Jokiniemi gives tips.
Create beauty around you
A beautiful decor is brought out only with suitable light solutions.
Modern home decorator has plenty to choose from.
A subdued japandi style combining Scandinavian and Japanese things is currently popular.
On the other hand, also the modern and playful retro style drawing inspiration from the 70s has had a boom in popularity, with its different metallic tones and icecream colours.
Authenticity charms in the same way it does in other house decor.
The materials now include wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather, and bamboo.
Express your personality
People invest in their homes much more than before, and decor has became a way to express one’s personality.
Instead of mass production, people want to have a tailored, even a bold lamp that has a story to tell.
People are clearly looking for Finnish and Nordic products with a well-known origin and designer.
They are very design-aware, Jokiniemi says.
One does not necessarily buy the most recent trendy lamp to one’s home, but rather a timeless classic one has saved many years for.
Certain kinds of timeless, jewel-like, elegant classics hang on from year to year, Jokiniemi says.
Thanks and goodbye!
KooKoo showed the door to their Canadian forward after three matches
The ways parted for KooKoo and forward Brendan O’Donnell.
The Canadian forward wore orange and black for a total of three Liiga matches without points, KooKoo’s press release says.
O’Donnell transferred to KooKoo in August with a one year contract including a trial period until the end of September.
During the last season, the 26-year-old forward played in KHL team Kunlund Red Star and in KHL farm league VHL in KRS Heilongjiang.
There is no information yet about O’Donnell’s new team.
Pelimies wants to show example in recycling - the merchandise is shipped in recycled boxes, plastic gave way to paper
Pelimies, a shop specialising in games, nowadays recycles not only games but also packaging materials.
Brick and mortar shop customers’ items are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in paper bags made from recycled material.
Items purchased via web store are packed for example in packaging that has come from the importers.
All the arriving packages are reused.
We may use the boxes about ten times, as long as the package is in usable condition, Ville Puurula from Pelimies Oulu says.
As padding material, the company mainly uses newspapers and other like recycled material.
We avoid bubble wrap as much as possible.
In the near future we plan to switch over to recycled material also with envelopes.
The company wants to be an example for others, too.
According to Puurula, recycling causes no additional trouble.
It's not a big problem to begin recycling.
It will also bring savings, when for example pasteboard packages are reused.
Recycling fits naturally in Pelimies’ operations, because in addition to new products, the shop's primary range of products include for example secondhand games and devices.
A must buy for every fashionista: A one and the same shirt works with every outfit
Classic clothes work from season to season, in any outfit.
With their versatility they create a good basis for a wardrobe, because it is easy to assemble different outfits around quality classics even inexpensively.
In the autumn, the most used wardrobe classics include high-quality knits.
A black turtleneck belongs to this category.
Black sweater with a turtleneck, made from natural materials can’t be a wrong purchase.
The garment can be combined with trousers, tulle skirt as well as with jeans, and it's possible to create a style that is either subdued or striking around it.
A turtleneck sweater fits both a youthful, modern dresser and a classically elegant master of style.
This is how to create the style.
This autumn’s trendy look is created with golden brown, flared trousers, a black turtle neck, and grey ankle boots.
A classic turtleneck together with other classics, a blue and green plaid skirt and wine red loafers form a feminine and elegant outfit.
Give a black turtleneck an edge by combining it with casually trendy garments: a denim skirt, high boots, and thick tights.
Youthful and stylish!
Russian intelligence services’ sabotage activities have a long tradition
There is no reason to suppose that the Foreign Intelligence Service of the Russian Federation (SVR) or The Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (GRU) would have abandoned this mode of operation.
During Soviet times, so called DRG groups specialised in sabotage activities.
The name comes from Russian words diversionno-razvedyvatelnaja gruppa: sabotage and intelligence group.
The agents of Soviet security service KGB working in western countries prepared detailed plans for important sabotage targets, says KGB archivist Vasili Mitrokhin (1922-2004) who defected to the West.
His information was published in Christopher Andrew’s books in the late 1990s and in the beginning of 21st century.
Among others, the targets included harbours, shipyards, big dams, oil refineries, and gas pipe connections.
In Germany, KGB acquired Bunderswehr, railroad, gamekeeper, and road worker uniforms and accessories to be used by DRG groups in cover operations.
This trick was used by Russian paratroopers in the Crimea in February 2014; they dressed in local Ukrainian riot police's gear, set up checkpoints on the roads leading from peninsula to Ukraine, and sealed Crimea off from its mother country.
During the cold war, agents hid equipment packages with mines, explosives, detonators, and communication devices in the ground for sabotage groups.
As late as in 1998, a KGB cache was found in Switzerland, and when officials sprayed it with a water cannon, its booby-trap detonated.

Sport manager of Hämeenlinna's HPK, Mika Toivola says that Filip Riska (center) has been a important player for the team in face-offs, penalty killing, and taking a defending role in fourth line.
Filip Riska, on trial period for the beginning of autumn, continues in HPK for the rest of the season.
The team management was impressed by Riska’s, 33, success in roles offered to him.
Filip has been an important puzzle piece in face-offs, penalty killing, and in a fourth line defending role.

True story on TV today: A climber left to die twice
American Beck Wathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on the man's own experiences.
Tonight’s movie is based on them.
Everest has its premiere in Finnish TV now.
In May 1996, climbers on Mount Everest were overtaken by a disastrous snowstorm .
Baltasar Kormákur’s 2015 direction tells about the fight for survival that has been covered plenty of times.
There have been previous films - and documents - about the tragedy.
The real events are looked through also in this article.
22 years ago, the world's highest mountain took the lives of eight climbers.
Two of them were experienced expedition leaders: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It was precisely Hall, who was Weathers’ guide.
An eye surgery performed just before his departure to Nepal might have saved Weathers’ life.
Because of that and the air pressure, he lost his eye sight, which meant he had to pass the climb to the summit.
Rob Hall continued to climb and didn’t return.
However, Weathers’ life-and-death struggle had only just begun.
As the storm blew up, he got lost and didn’t find his way back to the camp.
When people came to look for the man, they found him in such a bad condition that they didn’t believe he would survive.
Weathers was left to die.
As if by a miracle, he still managed to find her feet and find the others.
Weathers was badly frostbitten, so they still though he was dying, and once again he was left to his own devices.
It is obvious that against all expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, also his fellow climbers began to believe in his chances to such an extent they helped him.
The film features Josh Brolin as Beck Weathers,
Jason Clarke as Rob Hall, and Jake Gyllenhaal as Scott Fisher.
Other roles feature for example Robin Wright, Keira Knightley, and Emily Watson.
Eno church bicentenary has been celebrated today
The 200-year-old church of Eno has been celebrated within the church precinct today.
The church was opened on 4th October 1818, and to celebrate the anniversary, a celebration for the whole family was organised on Sunday.
At then o’clock the celebration began within the church precinct with a family service, after which a Karelian banquet table was set at Eno church hall.
The church was full.
517 people took part in the family service.
Eno vicar Armi Rautavuori was happy that people showed up in the church in such great numbers.
It will be a great joy for a long time yet and gives energy for my work, Rautavuori (in the picture) says.
The Kiihtelysvaara church fire has resonated with many, and it was not ignored in the Eno church bicentenary celebration.
Eno church is now the oldest among Joensuu Evangelic Lutheran parishes after Kiihtelysvaara church was destroyed in a fire.
Kiihtelysvaara wooden church was completed in 1770.
A prayer meeting was organised at Kiihtelysvaara in the morning, where the people calmed down and reminisced the church that was destroyed in a fire.
Pictures and videos: A medicane flashed its powers in Greece - the sea disappeared and a street turned into a river
A strong, hurricane-type autumn storm rolled to Greece from the southwest on Saturday.
A Mediterranean hurricane, a medicane, has been named Zorba.
The Hellenic National Meteorological Service issued a red weather warning to areas of Attica, Peloponnesus, the Ionian Islands, the Cyclades, and Crete.
Pictures taken from the area show a lot of flooding all around Greece.
A video published on Twitter shows, how, instead of a street, a river caused by flooding suddenly appeared between houses in the town of Kiato located in Corinthia.
Another video shows a car being carried by floodwaters.
In the southern part of Peloponnesus peninsula a strong wind caused rough seas.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens instructed people on its Facebook page to prepare for a storm in Greece.
The embassy urges people to follow weather forecasts and local officials’ instructions.
A mediterranian hurricane, also known as a medicane, brings about torrential rains and even a threat of flooding.
CNN reports that according to a study published in 2011, only about 1-2 medicanes occur per year, typically during the months of September and October, when sea surface temperatures are still quite warm.
The current storm triggered flash flooding across Tunisia and Libya before moving north over the Mediterranean towards Europe.
A cause for concern in Greece are the refugee camps on islands, like on Lesbos.
The thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in the camps have limited possibilities of finding proper protection.
Also the areas destroyed by last summer's wildfires near Athens are under threat.
A medicane raged in Greece also in last November.
No going offshore, the flights still on schedule - there are currently thousands of Finns holidaying in the Greek islands threatened by an autumn gale.
All offshore tours are cancelled, and one should be careful also when walking, so that branches or other loose objects flying in the storm do not hit one.
During the weekend, the guides distributed these kinds of instructions for the about 3,500 Finns holidaying in Greek via Aurinkomatkat.
The instructions are needed, because according to the forecast, it is possible that the Zorba storm battering the Greek islands this weekend can reach even a hurricane level.
For example, near the island of Crete, the wind velocity in gusts can rise even up to 45 metres per second.
The rottenness of the weather is made worse by torrential rains.
According to tour operators, all the people who have given their phone numbers and have travelled with Aurinkomatkat and Tui from Finland to Greece, have been warned about the strong winds with a text message.
Still sunny and warm
According to Aurinkomatkat Deputy Communications Manager Inka Ikonen, by Saturday early evening, the holiday resorts have managed to avoid the worst.
For example, the flights have landed and took off according to normal schedule.
Naturally we are constantly following the situation.
Safety comes first.
Tui’s Emergency Phone Duty Officer Antonia Schroderus says also their flights have ran on schedule.
We are constantly in contact with our staff in the resort.
It was still peaceful at least in Crete, she said early on Saturday evening.
Tui has currently a little over 1,500 Finnish travellers located in the most popular Greek islands, Rhodes and Crete.
Additionally, there are some a few hundred travellers staying in smaller locations.
For example, the worst storm will most likely reach the island of Kos on Sunday morning.
At the same time, Rhodes even saw a bit of sun on Saturday afternoon, and the temperature rose to 27 degrees, says Ikonen from Aurinkomatkat.
It is estimated that Zorba will continue to trouble Turkey next, even though it will be slightly eased off.
To prepare for this, we have already contacted our staff in Turkey, and for example checked the number of Finns who have flown to Antalya with Tui, Schroderus says.
Shirly Karvinen and Janni Hussi wore the exact same evening gown for the beauty contest final - this is how they reacted
A media personality and fitness beauty Janni Hussi arrived at Miss Finland final on Saturday wearing a low-backed evening dress.
Hussi says she got the dress from Meslew.
I went to the shop and decided to trust the professionals, who did find me an absolutely gorgeous dress for tonight, Hussi smiles.
Host Shirly Karvinen had chosen to wear the exact same silvery evening dress.
The pair themselves noticed their matching outfits and reacted with laughter.
Karvinen told Ilta-Sanomat her preparations were hurried, and she had to get ready in an aeroplane.
Hussi was a backstage and red carpet host in the contest final, and she interviews the arriving front row stars.
Hussi has a recent move behind her, since she moved to Jätkäsaari from Kamppi on Friday.
For the time being I’m going to stay there, we’ll see what happens.
The essential thing is that the new flat has a separate study, Hossi reflects.
Before the move, Hussi holidayed alone in Greece.
It was lovely, I was at the hotel for a week without going anywhere.
As my stress eased I got a cold, but otherwise the holiday was really successful, Hussi says.
Shirly Karvinen’s aeorplane behaviour attracted a lot of attention - the pensioners’ curious eyes were on her
Host and Miss Finland 2016 Shirly Karvinen told at the red carpet of Miss Finland finals that she has been busy with radio hosting and Love Island Finland shoots.
Karvinen has indeed been so busy she arrived to the final directly from a Finnair flight.
I did my hair and make-up in the aeroplane.
This is real glamour.
I changed into my evening dress at home, Karvinen laughs.
Karvinen says she drew out her makeup kit surrounded by pensioners.
Her preparations drew the fellow travelers’ attention.
I had a big mirror and via the mirror I could see people looking.
My makeup was amusing at least to others.
Karvinen flies to Spain once a week.
She spends a few days at a time in Marbella.
Karvinen says she has enjoyed her work as host for Love Island Finland.
She describes her experience so far to have been also thought-provoking.
Karvinen says she said hello to the show's singles on Friday.
Somehow it was really tough.
These are people's real feelings, Karvinen describes the show's singles’ feelings.
How to wear over-the-knee boots?
Three perfect example outfits
Classic clothes are garments that work from season to season, in any outfit.
Often classics are decades old, but sometimes newer items can come along.
An autumn and winter seasons’ hit shoe a few years ago, over-the-knee boots are not going anywhere.
As the name describes, boots coming up to above the knees repeat stylishly year after year, season after season.
Impressive boots divide the users’ opinions, but you should be bold and try this, well, bold style.
You see, over-the-knee boots suit almost any kind of outfit.
No matter whether it's denim, lace, tulle or tricot, the boots’ simple leather or fake leather surface works.
Long boots look good both with party looks and with everyday outfits.
Black over-the-knee boots match even very soft outfits.
They balance the femininity of a pink, floral pleated skirt and a soft, massive knit just right.
A fresh but stylishly autumnal everyday outfit to suit a romantic taste.
A strong and slightly retro outfit is created with a long, copper brown velvet dress, over-the-knee boots, impressive earrings, and a studded small bag.
Even though over-the-knee boots have a certain elegance, they are also a perfect match to a relaxed everyday outfit, together with a t-shirt, long shorts, and a trendy cap.
Wonderfully easy and yet so stylish!
Two robot cars to begin operation in Espoo
They will operate the rest of the year and take passengers, Espoo city reports.
Otaniemi robot cars act as a bus simulator, because the plan is to begin operation with a robot bus in the area next spring.
The project concerns developing and piloting a year-round robot vehicle traffic, and testing the vehicles technical functionality in Finnish conditions.
The trial will investigate how robot cars manage with the current street network.
At the same time, the city offers robot bus developers a possibility to develop the technology in a real environment, Head of Traffic Management Johanna Nyberg says.
This is the first time robot cars operate completely automatically among other traffic without any specific traffic arrangements.
The vehicle safety is on the responsibility of an assisting passenger always aboard the vehicle.
The vehicles sense continuously sense their environment with many different sensors, evaluating if the road is unobstructed.
If it is not, they decipher whether the sensed obstruction is a vehicle, a bicycle, or for example a snow flake, says Harri Santamala, CEO of Sensible 4, the company in charge of developing robot traffic.
The robot cars operate the whole autumn three days a week: on Tuesdays between 13 and 15.30, Wednesdays 10-15, and Thursdays 10-15.
The robot cars have six stops during their route and they take passengers aboard.
The robot car stops can be recognised from the stop markings.
The surest way to get aboard is from the stop number 1 at Otakaari.
Mokoma bassist fell off the stage in the middle of a gig and got hurt
Band Mokoma reports the surprising situation during their gig at Pakkahuone, Tampere, on their Facebook page.
Mokoma's gig at Pakkahuone in Tampere had a dramatic turn on Saturday, as the band bassist Santtu Hämäläinen fell off the stage in the middle of the performance.
The event took place as the band was playing the final song of the evening.
Hämäläinen broke his wrist.
The band reports the event on their Facebook page.
‘I’m alive!’
Yesterday Santtu tripped from the Pakkahuone stage during the last piece and broke his wrist.
Let’s wish our metal brother a speedy recovery!
The rest of the tour gigs will be taken care of with backups, the page says.
Mokoma fans are worried when replying to the picture update of Santtu the bassist lying on the bed with a cast in his arm.
We've been waiting for the news, we were really worried how bad it was.
It’s a big relief, luckily the bones will heal in time.
Good luck and speedy recovery to Santtu, and good rest of the tour for the band and the stand-in!
And thanks for yesterday, the gig was great, but in the future please leave this kind of drama out from the gig endings? one fan writes.
Police supervised hunting in North Karelia and Savolax
Eastern Finland Police Department carried out hunting supervision together with Metsähallitus and Finnish Wildlife Agency in North Karelia and Savolax on Friday and Saturday, the hunting contact persons of the police department said in social media on Saturday.
The main emphasis in supervision was the legality and permissibility of hunting.
Each hunter's game licence and hunting permit required on state land were checked.
In addition, the hunting gun licences were checked, as well as cartridge number of automatic weapons used in hunting game birds.
According to the police, 112 hunters were checked during the supervision, and only on hunter without a requisite hunting permit was found.
The hunter was punished with 12 unit fines for illicit hunting.
The police also conducted breath tests on 133 drivers, and two of them are suspected of drink driving.
The patrols also handled five traffic infractions with fine penalties, the police recapitulates.
In summary, it can be concluded that hunters observe hunt permissibility extremely well.
Many hunters were surprised by the supervision.
One hunter stated ‘I have hunted in the area for 50 years, and this was the first time someone checks the permits’.
Eastern Finland Police Department continues hunting supervision together with other supervision officials in the autumn.
Mykkänen travels to Turkey to observe the selection of Syrian quota refugees
Minister of the Interior Kai Mykkänen (National Coalition) will travel to Turkey in the next few days to observe the selection of quota refugees coming to Finland.
This year, it has been decided that Finland will receive 530 Syrians from Turkis refugee camps.
The selection trips are usually done a couple of times per year, with representatives from the Finnish Immigration Service, the Ministry of Employment and the Economy, and the Police.
Currently the delegation is already in Turkey, conducting interviews.
The United Nations’ High Commissioner for Refugees UNHCR first selects people who are in an especially vulnerable situation as candidates.
In practice, this means people who are considered to be in an exceptional distress, such as single parent families, handicapped and sick persons, women and children.
There are more people selected to the group arriving in Finland than the quota requires, since in practice some of them will not arrive for different reasons.
While in Turkey, Minister Mykkänen will also meet Turkish Minister of the Interior, Süleyman Soylu, and non-governmental organisations operating on the Syrian border.
Minister Mykkänen will be accompanied by Permanent Secretary Ilkka Salmi.
Talks about additional quota
Finland has been admitting quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees per year.
For a couple of years, the quota was 1,050 refugees per year, but since then, the Government has not reached an agreement about an increase.
The National Coalition Party has supported the quota increase, but the last time, the idea was shut down by the Blue Reform.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre) recently proposed the quota to be increased gradually to 1,500-2,000 people per year.
Mykkänen’s visit is the first one the Minister of the Interior makes to observe the selection of quota refugees during this term of government.
The former Ministers of the Interior, Petteri Orpo (National Coalition) and Paula Risikko (National Coalition), transferred to their new tasks before the visits could be arranged.
Finland receives a 10,000 euro subsidy for every refugee in an especially vulnerable situation.
Really going off the track now - it’s impossible to know whether to laugh or cry
Last Saturday Karjalainen reported on the legislative proposal to amend the Animal Welfare Act.
The article gives an idea that to start with, the proposal prohibits all such animals that have not been separately permitted with a ministerial decree to be kept as farmed animals, pets, or in other way related to business operations.
So to start with, everything else is prohibited except the animals that are individually mentioned in the act.
If the proposal ends up as an act, this most likely means we are abandoning a common principle in western democracies that an act separately forbids an action that endangers the safety of society or good practices.
Now the proposed provisions essentially forbid all such activities that the act or decrees don't separately permit.
The change will result in a situation where nothing new can be tried in for example business, and no other things can be done before an approving act has been adopted or a decree issued.
The government’s actions in bill drafting in general have been weak.
If we now go down the road that leads to a Finland where everything is forbidden that is not separately permitted, I don’t know any more whether to laugh or cry.
I don't doubt that the Animal Welfare Act needs an update.
But statute drafting in this direction is not a part of democracy.
Unfortunately I don't know the Constitution all that well, but I wonder whether it permits this kind of ‘everything is forbidden if it's not separately permitted in an act or a decree’ procedure.
I wish there would be a sensible minister to stop the progression of statute drafting of this kind.
Metti Forssell gives a tip: The four trendiest skirts of the autumn
The trend garment of this autumn comes with a snakeskin pattern.
It looks remarkably good especially in skirts.
Pair a snakeskin skirt with a subdued top, like a turtleneck or a regular t-shirt, to keep the outfit stylish.
This year there is a lot of silk out there, and a silk skirt especially is one of the season’s trendiest garments.
Pair a gorgeous silk skirt elegantly with a feminine top or casually with a knit.
You can also be more playful with a silk skirt, and put on for example trainers or this autumn’s trend shoes, cowboy boots.
No matter whether its grey, brown or multicoloured, all check skirts are now part of every woman’s must have autumn clothes.
Be bold when combining different colours and play with the check pattern also by using tops of different patterns.
For example a combination of check and polkadot patterns is beautiful.
Asymmetrical hems are a breath of summer’s lightness to take along to autumn.
Asymmetrical hem is at the same time both feminine and playful, and it fits perfectly both during weekdays and in a parties.
Baby Alexia, 3 months, sulks in a charming manner in Jere’s arms
In Karalahti family photo all the attention is on the sweet baby Alexia, aged three months.

Turkey recommends people to charge their cell phones in case of a storm
The Zorba storm that blew in Greece on Saturday is expected to move to Turkey on Sunday.
On Saturday, the meteorologists warned sailors, fishers, and farmers especially in the west coast of the country about the storm in Greece, writes CNN Türk.
The tropical storm is reported to move along the coast from south to north during the day.
Early Saturday evening, the disaster and emergency authorities recommended the citizens charge their cell phones before the storm and ensure the functioning of their internet connection, so they can receive up-to-date information, says local news agency Anadolu Ajansi.
The people are warned to stay at home and away from the windows, and move for example garden furniture away from the wind.
Turkey is expected to receive torrential rain with wind velocity between 28 and 33 metres per second.
Red weather warning in Greece
On Saturday, the Hellenic National Meteorological Service issued a red weather warning in southern Greece to areas of Attica, Peloponnesus, the Ionian Islands, the Cyclades, and Crete.
The Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the travel agencies organising trips to Greece warned the Finns in Greece about the storm Zorba.
Also the Finnish Embassy in Athens issued a storm warning.
The travellers were urged to follow the weather forecasts and local officials’ instructions.
A while ago when I contacted them, there were strong winds and rain.
The people were quite calm, Communications Manager Laura Aaltonen from Tui travel agency told STT on Saturday.
Aaltonen described the situation to be similar still on Saturday evening.
By the evening the Ministry for Foreign Affairs had received no messages from Finns in distress.
Ships did not operate in many Greek harbours on Saturday, local news agency Amna reported.
The boat trips offshore were cancelled on Saturday, the travel agencies told to STT.
According to the Finnish Embassy in Athens, temporary disruptions were expected in air and ship traffic.
Finnair reported on Saturday they are actively following the weather situation.
Kimi Räikkönen summed up the reason for Mercedes supremacy compared to Ferrari
Ferrari’s Kimi Räikkönen had to admit that the worst rival Mercedes was too tough in the Russian GP qualifying.
There’s no reason for panic in the Ferrari camp, the experienced driver estimated.
They just were faster than us, but it's not a huge thing.
So far our car in the qualifying was the best thing the whole weekend, but they just were too fast, said Räikkönen, who finished fourth and, together with his team mate Sebastian Vettel, was clearly slower than Mercedes.
Ferrari had difficulties already in the previous race in Singapore.
Räikkönen was asked what is the cause for the sudden drop behind Mercedes.
They seem to go faster than us - that's how simple it is.
If I knew the reason for that, we’d probably go as fast as they are going.
However, I don't know anymore than anyone else.
This is constant guesswork, and they appear to be in the lead now.
Who knows why?
Räikkönen’s future team, Sauber, had a rare treat in the qualifying.
Charles Leclerc, who replaces Räikkönen at Ferrari next season, was seventh, and Marcus Ericsson also managed to make it to the final qualifying session.
The tenth position is the best one the Swedish driver has had in over three years.
And even if there were as many as five drivers not participating in the second session, the end result was still delicious for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging for Räikkönen, considering the next season.
Yes, if you compare to where they were in the beginning of the season, the step forward has been a huge one.
Next year there will be a different story, so we’ll see, we’ll see.
That was it - Robert Helenius knocked out Erkan Teper: ‘Robbe is back’
A match between Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper progessed in an even manner in the Stuttgart night.
The German had more initiative in the ring, but he didn’t manage to land good hits.
Helenius has a significantly wider reach and controlled the match with his hard series of punches that found their way in well.
The Finn also was obviously in a better physical condition than Teper.
The resolve finally came in the eighth round, as Helenius knocked Teper out with his left cross.
The punch was so hard the veteran, who was fighting in front of a home crowd, didn’t even try to get up from the mat.
After victory was confirmed, Helenius’ celebration was quite calm.
In the ring interview he first complimented the good atmosphere created by the audience and his opponent.
Then he changed into Finnish for a moment.
Thank you for all the spectators and Finnish supporters.
We took the belt with us today.
Helenius rejoiced right after the match.
From the perspective of Helenius’ career, this was a really big win.
There might even be a possibility to go to a world championship match, Helenius commented to Iltalehti before the match.
A defeat, on the other hand, might've ended his whole boxing career.
Of course I've thought about it.
I’m not getting any younger, 34-year-old Helenius admitted before meeting Teper.
Number of Indonesian disaster victims can multiply
According to The Guardian, the vice president of the country warns about a clear rise in the number of victims.
The vice president of the country, Jusuf Kalla, says the death toll can reach thousands.
Difficult circumstances
The rescuers look for those trapped in the ruins and also for the dead in the Sulawesi areas that have suffered worst: Harbour city of Palu and its neighbouring city of Donggala.
So far all the victims are from Palu, there is no certainty of Donggala situation.
Hundreds of people are missing and about 540 are badly injured.
There are still people trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings, and the rescuers have not yet been able to get out.
For example, hotel Roa Roa in Palu has collapsed.
The rescuers say they have heard trapped people crying from the ruins, but a lack of heavy clearing equipment has delayed rescue work.
Indonesian president Joko Widodo has ordered the troops to help in rescue and clearing work.
There is a need for army and its equipment, because electricity and communications links are down in many places in the disaster area.
Also fuel reserves are running short.
Miss Finland finalist’s hesitant answer and long consideration caused roars of laughter
New Miss Finland is currently being chosen at Billnäs Ruukki.
Each beauty finalist was asked a question during the interview round.
The finalists drew a question from a glass bowl on a table.
The hesitant answer of especially finalist number six, 23-year-old Emilia Anttikoski, brought about a hearty but benevolent laughter in the audience.
Question that was posed to Anttikoski came through Facebook.
User Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what is the last book the finalist has read.
Anttikoski considered her answer for quite a while, before she hesitantly began:
Thank you for your question, Pirkko-Ella.
The last book I’ve read is..., Anttikoski said pondering.
Her pause for consideration caused roars of laughter in the audience, until Anttikoski continued:
The last book I’ve read is...
I've read books in school!
Probably something related to economics.
So the last book I’ve read is something about economics, Anttikoski answered.
After her answer, Anttikoski received resounding applauds from the audience, accompanied by laughter.
Earlier during the Miss Finland tour Anttikoski attracted attention because she didn’t want to pose in just underwear on account of her principles.
Miss Finland 2018 will be chosen at 9 pm, when last year’s Miss Finland Michaela Söderholm resigns the title.
Sikke's apple and pear cake is delectable
This is a recipe for you, who have your own good, sour apples, because Finnish apples are dreadfully expensive in the shop.
Pears you might have to buy, even though many might already have a pear tree growing, too.
It is possible to make this cake just from apples, if you don't want to buy pears.
Obviously the flavour is more diverse, if you also invest in a pear.
Peel the apples and the pear, remove the cores.
Slice them.
Melt the butter in a pan.
Beat the eggs and sugar into a froth, then add corn flour and melted butter.
Combine cornstarch, i.e. maizena, and baking powder, and add those to the batter.
Add almond flour and wheat flour, mix well.
Line a bread pan with baking sheet paper, sprinkle two tablespoons of sugar on the bottom of the pan, and spread pear slices on top of the sugar.
Spoon half of the batter on top of pear slices and spread the apple slices on top of the batter.
Spoon the rest of the batter on top of the apple slices.
Bake in an oven in 180 degrees for about an hour, until the surface is nicely brown.
Let cool in the pan and then remove to a platter.
Do not cut the cake until it’s properly cooled.
The cake structure is fragile and easily crumbled, because the batter contains gluten free almond and corn flours.
An international crime fiction festival will be organised at Ruka in January
An international literature festival focussing on nordic crime fiction will be organised for the first time at Ruka, Kuusamo in January.

Status symbols do not attract friends - Four facts about popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic or admired?
Sydney University researchers analysed the matter, and outlined two types of ‘coolness’ consisting of slightly different characteristics: generally attractive coolness and its partial counterpart, dissident coolness.
According to researchers, attractively cool people had many socially desired characteristics: they were extroverted, friendly, conciliatory, and competent.
The dissidents, on the other hand, were typically distant, independent, rebellious, and had an edge to their personality.
They craved for experiences and cared little for outsiders’ evaluations.
Both types had good self-esteem and steady emotional life in common.
Tough role is not cool in the long run: high status during teenage years does not necessarily lead to success later in life.
This is reported in an American study published in Child Development journal in 2014.
Young people who started dating early, partied, gravitated towards good-looking groups, and wanted to be popular, as young adults had a bigger risk of substance use and straying into crime.
They managed their relationships worse than their once more unnoticeable peers.
Luxury cars, designer bags or watches signifying high status do not make a person cool - or at least not genuinely attractive company.
In a research published in Social Psychological and Personality Science in August, most of the people were more willing to befriend a person dressed in a high-street shirt than in a designer label shirt - even though most people chose to wear a designer shirt for the introductory situation.
If you’re in the Greek holiday islands, beware!
A storm is about to hit there - a weather forecast is screaming red
During the weekend, the rainfall in southern Greece may be equal to the average amount of rain in Finland during six months.
Zorba storm will hit Greece during the weekend.
Be prepared if you are staying in the area of Peloponnesus, the Ionian Islands, the Cyclades or Crete.
The storm will be very strong, so the Finnish Embassy in Athens reports about it on its Facebook page.
According to the Embassy, the Hellenic National Meteorological Service has issued a red weather warning to these areas.
The oncoming storm is also told about in weather service Foreca’s blog.
According to it, the strongest winds can be up to 45 metres per second.
By way of comparison, the Kuisma storm that lashed Finland early in the week blew about 31 metres per second at its height.
According to the blog, the biggest concern of Zorba storm is not the wind though, but the heavy rain.
There can be up to 300 mm rainfall in the southern Greece during the weekend.
This is equivalent of about a half of Finnish annual rainfall.
Weather service Severe Weather Europa has shared a video about the storm development on its Facebook page.
Earlier this week, the Zorba storm has caused flooding in Tunisia and Libya.
Do you recognise Anku from Love Island Finland, drooled over by men?
Appears on confusing YouTube videos
Not many know that the beauty Anku, drooled over by men in Love Island Finland show, also appears as a craft lady on odd YouTube videos published in 2010.
On these videos, Anku advises the crafters for example how to build an octopus out of an old kitchen paper roll.
In her sympathetic style, Anku also shows how to make a hedgehog with real, growing spikes from old pair of tights.
Now it’s time to grow Easter grass, but we’ll do it in slightly surpising a way, Anku hints and presents saw dust, tights, and grass seeds to make the hedgehog.
You can see the videos below or from Anku’s YouTube channel here.
Valtteri Bottas was shaking and bursting with adrenaline in Sochi - will he have to be Hamilton’s aid on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas was still shaking dozens of minutes after his pole position-worthy drive, standing in front of the media.
A great lap left behind Mercedes number one star, Lewis Hamilton, and was no doubt important also mentally for the Finnish driver, who has gathered his share of criticism this season.
A nice lap.
I don’t know what happened to Lewis when he did not finish the decisive lap.
It feels good, I’m still shaking a bit, Bottas clarified.
I’ve had only one pole position this year, in Austria (in midsummer), so quite a bit of time has passed.
This circuit has been good to me in the past, and again I had some good laps.
It's not easy to overtake at Sochi circuit, so the start plays an especially large role.
And naturally Bottas had to reply to a question whether he's driving for victory tomorrow or whether he has to assist Hamilton, who is close to reaching the championship title.
My goal to the race is definitely trying to win.
When you have a pole position at the start, it really is the only goal, Bottas states.
But as a team, we fight for both championships.
Lewis’ lead to Sebastian Vettel is quite big, and the gap between him and me is very big, so I have to bear that in mind.
We’ll see what happens, Bottas added, though.
After the qualifying, Hamilton was genuinely happy about Bottas’ success, and also Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff was pleased.
Lewis meant to win Valtteri, but he didn’t succeed in the seventh turn.
Valtteri knows he has to give everything he has to win Lewis.
And he was so charged that adrenaline was bursting from his ears, Wolff enthused.
Wolff was evasive when answering a question about whether the team will allow Bottas and Hamilton to drive fairly.
We're going to have the conversation tomorrow morning and then see how the race is going to pan out.
Erno Kinnunen from Kitee won the Finnish Rally Championship
The Finnish Rally Championship series had a rare ending.
Hardly ever have brothers ended up as Finnish champions at the same time.
Now Eerik and Henrik Pietarinen from Tuusula achieved that in the final rally driven in Salo-Turku area, as Eerik won the SM(FRC)1 and Henrik SM(FRC)2 class.
Erno Kinnunen from Kitee ensured the best achievement of his career, as the third place in the final rally clinched his Finnish championship in the two-wheel drive cars’ SM(FRC)4 class.
Competing with a Honda Civic, Kinnunen and navigator Ville Mäkelä began the Turku event with patience, since the starting points were clear: a position in the leading group would guarantee the title.
In the darkness of Friday evening, the pair had to give others a handicap, when part of their additional headlamps betrayed them in the second special stage.
We were pretty blind for a third stretch.
You can't fuss around in a situation like that.
On Saturday we just followed behind Jussi Teppo, who was second in the series, Kinnunen said.
Syria demands the United States, France, and Turkey to withdraw their troops
The Syrian foreign minister demands the United States, France, and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
Speaking for the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday, Foreign Minister Walid Muallem says the foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and without any stipulations.
Muallem said the foreign troops are in Syria to fight terrorism, and according to him, the war against terror is ‘almost over’.
In his UN address, Muallem also invited Syrian refugees to return to home country.
There is, however, no end in sight for the war of past seven years.
Over 360,000 people have died in the war.
On Friday, Chancellor Merkel said in Germany that a Syria meeting has been planned for October, and in addition to herself, the presidents of France, Russia, and Turkey would participate in it.
Not quite Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the Supreme Court Justice drama from the television
Judge Brett Kavanaugh, nominee for the Supreme Court, and professor Christine Blasey Ford, who accuses him of sexual assault, gathered exceptionally many people in front of their television sets.
The Supreme Court Justice nomination drama that is at full throttle in the United States gathered at least 20 million people in front of their televisions on Thursday.
That is when Kavanaugh, nominated by Donald Trump, and Californian professor Blasey Ford, who accuses him of harassment, appeared in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
According to preliminary results, the six main channels ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC, and NBC had a total of 20.4 million viewers during the hearing broadcast.
In addition, there were several million following the hearing online.
According to NBC, 6.8 million people followed their live stream, and CNN reported its record of the year with 8.2 million live broadcast launches.
CNN number rises to over 10 million, when people following the broadcast via YouTube and Facebook are counted in.
Also Fox News Digital reached 8.0 million launches.
Digital launches are reported by the channels themselves, TV viewer numbers come from research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen publishes the final numbers on Monday, but they are anyway going to be huge.
20 million viewers reached by few
Normally viewer ratings of over 20 million are reached only by sports matches, big Oscar and Emmy galas of the entertainment world, and occasional political events such as presidential speeches, and, in 2016, also presidential election debates.
The annual most viewed show of the United States, NFL final match Super Bowl is still far away, though.
This year, Super Bowl on NBC channel gathered about 103 million people in front of their screens.
According to Nielsen, last year Trump's first speech to the Congress was watched by a total of nearly 48 million people, and his inauguration by more than 30 million people.
Matter of top importance
Appointment as a justice to the Supreme Court is an extremely significant occasion, since it is a lifetime tenure.
Trump already got to appoint one new justice, when Antonin Scalia passed away in early 2016, and the Republicans managed to stop the then president Barack Obama from appointing his follower.
Another place became open when judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced this year he is going to retire.
Kennedy was appointed by the Republican President Ronald Reagan, but in many questions he was the so-called swing vote, who could decide the position of the court of nine.
He supported abortion rights and rights of the sexual minorities, and his vote was decisive in 2015, when gay couples nationwide received a right to marry.
Kavanaugh is considerably more conservative in his views.
His appointment to the Supreme Court may secure the Conservative dominance for decades.
Children have a right to let their parents see their information
Only the parents of children under 10 years see their children's health information in the Kanta service.
It is a big problem, it is wrong, and it is odd.
Originally the situation in the Kanta service was even more worrying: the parents could not see the babies’ medical records or prescriptions.
In autumn 2016, the situation was fixed for under the 10-year-olds with an amendment described as temporary
After that, there have been promises to fix the practices, but the fixing has taken astonishingly long.
Now a fix is on the way - in 2020.
Since the problem is an explicit one, changing the law basis should not have been anything more than an open-and-shut case.
After that, according to a layperson’s understanding, it is simply about pressing a button: now the wire is closed, so let's open it.
Naturally a child can show their information to the parents - if the child has banking user identifiers or an official identity card.
But how many 10-year-olds have those?
An identity card is not free, and a 10-year-old can’t even get banking identifiers.
So basically it is impossible for anyone to see a primary school fourth-former’s records without asking them to be printed out.
It’s not that much about the parents’ rights than about the children’s rights.
It is essential to a child’s care that parents can be involved.
Obviously it's important to take care of the teenager’s right to privacy.
Even minors can have family situations, where not all things can be freely discussed.
Often they are related to sexual health, and taking care of it freely is a deeply meaningful human right.
In the United States, the FBI began to unwrap the harassment allegations against Kavanaugh
According to American media, FBI is investigating harassment allegations by at least two women.
Earlier this week, one of the women was heard by the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh had denied the accusations concerning alleged sexual harassment during in his student days.
The United States President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations on request by the Senate Judiciary Committee.
The investigation must not take more than a week.
According to Washington Post, the ongoing investigation is a report more restricted than a criminal investigation, and it may not become available to the public.
A man threatened to kill police officers at Kajaani police station
An apprehended brawler continued protesting even at the station.
The police say they took the man in police custody to ‘calm down’.
The police was subjected to a suspected attackers threat in Kajaani during the night between Friday and Saturday.
The authorities report on the incident that began, as a man in his thirties was violently picking a fight in a city centre restaurant.
First the man assaulted another customer inside the restaurant.
This resulted in removal from the premises.
Outside the fighter attacked another man by knocking him over.
As a third party tried to intervene, the man hit also him.
The triple assault resulted in calling the police.
A patrol seized the man, taking him to Kajaani police station, the police say.
The suspected continued to act in an aggressive manner in the police station.
He kicked the other police in the leg.
He threatened to kill and beat up the police officers.
The police say they took the man in police custody to ‘calm down’.
The man is suspected of three assaults and a violent resisting of an official in the performance of his duties.
Humanitarian organisations prepare to begin work at Indonesia's Sulawesi - ‘Clean water is the most urgent thing’
United Nations Children’s Fund UNICEF and other international humanitarian organisations are prepared to help at Indonesian island of Sulawesi, recounts Kirsi Haru, Chief of Communication at UNICEF Finland.
The local authorities are in charge of the rescue operations, but the need for extra help is apparent already in this stage.
UNICEF operates in nearly every country, and we have long-term projects also in Indonesia.
UNICEF always has a complete emergency help preparedness, in addition to its normal operations, Haru says.
The first task now is to find the people from the ruins, both the living and the dead.
In the Sulawesi city of Palu, the rescue operations are ongoin, but a bit norther in the area of Donggala, the situation is less clear.
There are still places, where communications do not work.
Relief actions are difficult, because also the roads are blocked, Haru states.
Buildings on Sulawesi are often lightweight, so the destruction caused by the earthquake and tsunami are great.
When the survivors have been found, they need shelter - in the beginning for example tents - and clean water.
In crisis situations, clean water is the most urgent thing.
First thing we can generally offer to people are water purification tablets that also UNICEF has in stock.
The goal is to repair the water systems as soon as possible, but in emergency situations, water is transported with for example trucks.
In crisis situations, many children are separated from their parents.
Finding the family members and reuniting families is one part of the Unicef duties.
Food assistance is organised by, among others, WFP (World Food Programme), which works as a branch of UN.
In the first stage, previously raised funds are used for emergency help.
Unicef, among others, has however already began to raise funds to help the victims of the earth quake and tsunami in Indonesia.
Billionaire Elon Musk to quit as Tesla Chairman of the Board - 20 million dollar fine for his tweets
Elon Musk, founder of companies manufacturing space rockets and electric cars, avoids fraud charges with a deal with the United States’ Securities and Exchange Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk quits as electric car company Tesla's Chairman of the Board and agrees to a 20 million dollar fine.
Musk steps down as part of a deal he made with the authority regulating the United States’ securities industry.
With this deal Musk avoids fraud charges.
The United States’ Securities and Exchange Commission SEC threatened musk with a security fraud because of the tweets he sent in August.
In these tweets, Musk wrote he is preparing to take electric car company Tesla private, which resulted in a quick rise in the company's share price.
According to the deal, Musk is not allowed to act as Tesla chairman of the board for three years.
In addition, Tesla must nominate a new “independent member” to its board and take two “independent managers” to its management group.
Tesla also has to found a committee to supervise Musk’s communications.
Musk is allowed to continue as Tesla CEO.
On top of Musk's personal 20 million dollar fine, Tesla as a company also has to pay an equivalent 20 million fine to the Commission.
Tweets misled investors
According to SEC, Musk's tweets misled investors and Tesla shareholders.
Musk claimed to have secured funding to repurchase Tesla from the stock market to a private company.
According to the billionaire's tweets, the company would have been bought out from the stock market with a stock price of 420 dollars.
After the tweets, Tesla’s stock price rose over ten per cent in twenty-four hours, but later fell.
According to SEC, Tesla's claims had no basis of any kind.
According to the Commission, in reality he had not negotiated the funding he claimed to have.
Neither had he discussed withdrawing the company from the market with other members of the managing group or the company board.
Friday this week, the price decreased 14 per cent, as SEC published the fraud charge.
The news about settlement are expected to again re-enforce the company's stock price.
The reason is not the Last Judgement
Naturally the Cathedral's bells won't ring when the hands are not moving.
It's a technical malfunction.
The clock in Helsinki Cathedral tower has stopped.
The hands point at twelve o’clock.
The situation is like from a mediocre horror film: if only there was incantation coming from the crypt and the organ would play by themself.
This is naturally not the case, because the clock has stopped because of a technical malfunction: it’s broken.
A repairer has checked it, but there is a part broken and we are waiting to get a new part, sacristan Eveliina Jamsen says.
At the same time Jamsen confirms the fact already mentioned by Kirkko Helsingissä Twitter account.
That is to say, the reason for the clock stopping is not the Last Judgement, the account mentions.
Jamsen says the church bells don't ring because of a malfunction.
