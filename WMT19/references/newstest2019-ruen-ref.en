The European Union was set up to protect freedom. It was the Soviet Union that stopped people leaving.

It was important to attack during the power play. I am happy for our players who took advantage of the power play.
Recently, we have played well during power plays, but have not been able to score.

We knew that Minsk would come out locked and loaded and ready to put their best face forward, and that’s how it turned out.
The part of the game with a power play was decisive; we scored the winning goal during a power play.
We had a good third period today, despite the fact that we let in an early goal in the period and it was clear that it would not be easy.
But we played very well in defense, restricted the opponent to few chances, did not allow them to catch us out during substitutions. Dinamo did not have any power plays, so the game ended well for us", said Hartley, as reported by the Omsk press office.

Elon Musk was forced to leave his post as chairman of the board of directors of Tesla
The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Tesla founder Elon Musk settled their dispute over a fraud case.
CNBC News reports on this.
The TV network reports that under the agreement reached, Musk must leave his post as chairman of Tesla’s board of directors.
The SEC allowed Musk to still retain his post as chief executive of Tesla.
The Tesla founder must also pay an administrative fine in the amount of $20 million.
The same amount will also be collected from Tesla.
The money will be distributed among investors who were harmed.
In addition, the company must appoint two independent directors.
Elon Musk is an American entrepreneur on the list of the 50 wealthiest people on the planet according to Forbes magazine.
He is the head of the space company SpaceX, the neurotechnology company Neuralink, and creator of the electric-car company Tesla, as well as founder of Paypal.
The SEC previously brought a case against Tesla chief executive Elon Musk for his announcement posted on Twitter of a possible buyout of the company.
Last month Musk announced plans to make Tesla a private company and to buy out all its shares on the stock exchange at a fixed price of $420.
The $420 share price was supposedly set “due to the significance of this number in marijuana culture,” the Bloomberg news agency earlier reported with a quote by Steven Peikin, Co-Director of the SEC’s security department.
Elon Musk consequently dropped his plans to buy up the shares.
Commenting on the court case brought against him by the SEC, the businessman stated that he considers the allegations of fraud unfounded, and added that he is very disappointed and saddened by these claims.
“Honesty is the most important value in my life, and the facts will prove that I didn’t violate it at all,” said the businessman in an interview with CNBC.
Meanwhile in August a group of Tesla shareholders brought a class-action lawsuit against Musk complaining of financial losses that they had incurred.
The plaintiffs asserted that Musk’s posts resulted in losses for them.
In particular, one of the shareholders stated that the tweets from Musk led to mistakes whereby sellers of Tesla shares were forced to purchase securities at artificially high prices in order to cover their positions.
Other plaintiffs also pointed out that careless statements by Elon Musk caused sharp fluctuations in the share price.
In September Musk was accused of market manipulation also by the head of Citron Research.
Meanwhile, if Musk hadn’t been able to settle his case with the SEC, he could have faced removal from the company’s management and even prison.
Former SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt told CNBC about this.
Musk is “not a bad guy, but he’s not capable of managing a car company.”

On September 30, 1928, i.e., exactly 90 years ago, the British bacteriologist Alexander Fleming announced an unprecedented discovery.
The discovery of penicillin marked the beginning of the era of modern antibiotics, brought Fleming worldwide fame and made him the Nobel laureate.
By the way, the isolation of penicillin from mold fungi was not the first discovery of Fleming.
A few years earlier, when he had a cold, he placed mucus from his own nose on a Petri dish (this is a kind of a glass dish in which experiments are conducted with bacteria) and a few days later he discovered that the bacteria that was there had been destroyed.
Penicillin was also discovered by chance in almost the same way.
Fleming's name was added to the list of the 100 most prominent personalities in human history.
His discovery, according to many scholars, changed the course of history.
With the help of penicillin, medicine began to beat the most longstanding diseases previously considered incurable - tuberculosis, syphilis, gangrene...
When, shortly after receiving the Nobel Prize, in 1945, Fleming arrived in the French capital, Paris newspapers wrote: “He did more than dozens of divisions to defeat fascism and liberate France".
According to experts, Fleming’s discovery of the world's first antibiotic has saved the lives of more than 200 million people on Earth.
Alexander Fleming died in his home in London in 1955 from a heart attack.

By the way, I found this very interesting, in my opinion, porcelain work at the same place, in Madrid, but at another time and for a completely different reason.

Trump spoke of “being in love” with Kim Jong-un
While earlier they had bullied each other, the leaders of the US and North Korea have practically fallen in love, joked Donald Trump.
US President Donald Trump reported a well-executed joke about their successes in resolving the North Korea crisis.
After starting with mutual threats of annihilation, now the leaders of the two countries have smoothed out their relations so well that they are virtually in love with each other, the American President remarked.
The man in the White House mentioned that he had taken on the North Korea problem from the previous administration as the most difficult problem in foreign policy.
Trump notes that Barack Obama’s team had so neglected relations with North Korea that it couldn’t even reach the country’s leadership by phone — the other side basically didn’t pick up the receiver.
Then the US and North Korea were on the verge of war, but today the North Korean leader is writing “beautiful letters” to the White House, said Trump.
Trump admitted that he had been “nasty” to Kim Jong-un, which, by the way, was mutual.
But now their relations have been smoothed out to the point that the leaders “have fallen in love with each other.”
Trump meanwhile asked people not to take his words literally and warned that American media will interpret his statements as incompetence.
Trump pointed out that recently Pyongyang had stopped its nuclear and missile tests, and is closing military bases.
The American president is sure that all of this is the achievement of his administration.
Last Tuesday Donald Trump spoke flatteringly of Kim Jong-un at a meeting of the UN’s General Assembly.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for his bravery and for the steps he has taken to de-escalate tensions.
Trump also noted that sanctions against North Korea are being kept in place until the moment of full denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
Negotiations in Singapore
On the 12th of June in Singapore, the first negotiations in history took place between leaders of the US and North Korea.
After a significant worsening in relations and mutual threats to use nuclear weapons, the summit looked like a breakthrough in the protracted North-Korean/American crisis.
At the end of the negotiations, the two sides expressed the intention to move in the direction of a peaceful resolution of the conflict, while not taking on any legal obligations.
Positive results from the meeting were the suspension of nuclear and missile tests by North Korea, as well as the return to the US of the remains of American soldiers from that country.
At the same time, no other practical steps toward the denuclearization of North Korea are being taken.
News media have reported that after the Singapore summit, the US sent several scenarios for disarmament to North Korea, but Pyongyang rejected them, calling them “gangster-like.”
Volgograd residents squeeze mustard oil with their own hands
A mustard festival was held today, September 29, at one of the museums in southern Volgograd. Attendees learned about how mustard oil is made using old techniques.

Nitsoi called for replacing "Moscow language with a Ukrainian product"
Ukrainian children's author and advocate for the purity of her native language, Larisa Nitsoi called for relieving Ukraine from the "Russian-language Moscow product and Moscow language."
To do this, she proposes as the Ukrainian product - "a cultural wave, a cultural onslaught."
Nitsoi shared her thoughts on "the feasibility of eradicating the Russian language in Ukraine" with the Ukrainian publication "Observer".
In her words, the right Ukrainian product is ready now - it already exists and will continue to be developed.
With time, Ukrainians will "recover" from this "Moscow language", she asserted.
For example, in neighboring Poland, in her words, Russian speech was widespread on television and radio, but it was practically absent in the public arena.
In this regard, in Nitsoi's opinion, Ukrainians are not using aggressive methods in this process: actions by authorities to prohibit the use of the Russian language, in her opinion, merely "expand the boundaries for Ukrainian speech at a legal level."
Previously, Nitsoi shared her experience supporting a "Ukrainian language regime" at a children's camp in the Carpathians, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016 she threatened to sue the Watsons bookstore chain, one of whose cashiers spoke to her in Russian.
Nitsoi lost her temper and threw her change at the young woman.
She called Ukrainians' use of Russian words "linguistic schizophrenia", calling on Ukrainians to refrain from using Russian letters even when writing last names.
Recently Nitsoi announced that the name "Rus" was stolen from Ukrainians, and thus Russia should be referred to as Muscovy.
Even the Ukrainian Security Service could not evade the writer's wrath: having visited there and overheard conversations among coworkers in Russian, she started a scandal and absconded, slamming the door.
During the break we had a man-to-man talk, and it bore fruit

“It turned out to be a really tough game, we had a serious man-to-man talk during the break, and it bore fruit: we scored two goals and kept the opponent at bay.
“You missed a few matches due to your injury at the beginning of the month.
How do you feel today?”
“I played the entire 90 minutes, so all is well!
In fact, I felt good.
Maybe at the end I slowed up a little to keep things safe.
Otherwise, the medics and physiotherapist Vladimir Gashnev led me to this game, and I am so thankful to them!
“What can you say about the atmosphere in the team?”
“It is no great secret that after victories it is easier to recover and the mood in the team is positive.
Now we are on a good run, although at first we had some bad luck.
We need to continue in the same spirit and make our fans happy”.
“Did you miss the game during your time away from the rink?"
“I did indeed miss it a little, because I really was in an unpleasant situation.
But I would like to reiterate my thanks to the physiotherapist and medics for putting me on my feet.
The most important thing is that we won and made our fans happy.
Everything else is of minor importance".

We call on citizens to observe laws and refrain from any violations of public order and peace and any violations of electoral secrecy," said the Interior Ministry representative.
In the referendum on Sunday citizens were invited to answer one question: "Do you support membership of the EU and NATO by accepting the agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Greek Republic?"
The referendum is aimed at settling a 27-year dispute between Macedonia and Greece about the name of the former Yugoslav republic, which coincides with the name of a northern Greek region.
At an official ceremony on 17 June on the bank of Lake Prespa, through which the border between the two countries passes, the foreign ministers of Macedonia and Greece signed an agreement on the official name of the former Yugoslav republic.
It envisages the use of the name "Republic of North Macedonia".

The head of the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs also stressed that S-300 is a defensive and not offensive system, and it is intended for protecting the Syrian sky.
Pashinyan hopes to conduct early elections to the parliament of Armenia in 2018
Elections to the parliament of Armenia may take place as soon as in 2018, announced the prime minister of the country Nikol Pashinyan.
"Possibly, by the end of the year," replied the head of the government to journalists' question about the timeframe for them to take place (quote from Interfax).
Mr. Pashinyan also did not exclude that "again people will take to the streets" for conducting early elections, if the discussion of this issue with parliamentary forces is not crowned with success.
But I am inclined to conduct negotiations with parliamentary forces.
I hope that they are also ready for a constructive dialog", the premier was quoted as saying by Novosti-Armenia.
Nikol Pashinyan added that early elections are a demand of the people, and also a part of the government's program, for which the parliament voted.
"The long-term vision of the government," in his words, is also necessary for attracting investment and the development of the economy.
At the General Assembly of the UN in New York, Mr. Pashinyan promised after his return to Yerevan to start "negotiations with representatives of all parliamentary, and also non-parliamentary forces, in order to discuss the timing and conditions of early elections".

Accusations were news for Dagestani deputy
The Sovetsky regional court of Makhachkala remanded in custody for two months the deputy of the People's Assembly Radzhab Abdulatipov, suspected of participating in a criminal organisation that documented disability status for bribes.
Kommersant learned the details of materials of the investigation, shedding light on how, exactly, according to the Investigative Committee of Russia, the younger brother of the former head of the republic Ramzan Abdulatipov, Radzhab Abdulatipov aided the criminal activity of the now former head of the Main Bureau of Medical and Social Expertise Magomed Makhachev and his accomplices.
Among other things, in the course of the criminal intelligence and surveillance operations conducted by employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, it was established that Radzhab Abdulatipov had lobbied for the appointment of Magomed Makhachev to the position of head of the bureau, allegedly having received for this 70 mln rub.
Recall that earlier, in relation to Magomed Makhachev, other managers and employees of territorial bureaus of medical and social expertise subordinate to him, the investigation opened a criminal case under art. 210 (creation of a criminal organization with the use of professional position and participation in it), art. 290 (receipt of a bribe by an organized group), art. 292 (forgery by an official) and art. 159 (large scale fraud) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
As follows from the case materials, at the end of 2013 Radzhab Abdulatipov, knowing about the illegal activities of Magomed Makhachev and his accomplices, who were engaged in the theft of funds from the Pension Fund, joined their activities, having entered the criminal organization.
Holding the post of head of the directorate of the Federal Migration Service of Russia in Dagestan and having connections with governmental authorities and law enforcement structures, and also using his familial relationship with the leader of Dagestan, Radzhab Adulatipov, investigators believe, "ensured the activity of other participants of the criminal organization, established contacts with officials of governmental bodies for the support of the illegal activity of Magomed Makhachev and his holding of the position of head of the federal state-funded institution 'Main Bureau of Medical and Social Expertise of the Republic of Dagestan', organized the illegal confirmation of disability status of citizens".
After disclosure of this information at the meeting of the Sovetsky regional court on Friday Radzhab Abdulatipov denied the accusations against him.
"Of course, all, that today is brought on me in the form of an accusation, to me it is all new, I am completely unaware of it," he said.
The court arrested the deputy from United Russia not for 10 days before bringing charges, as was with previous high-ranking Dagestani bureaucrats, but immediately for two months, since the case includes art. 210 of the Russian Criminal Code.
According to the Criminal Procedure Code, for bringing charges the investigation has much more time – up to 45 days from the moment of detention.

Kosachev: At the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly the subject of Russia in a negative light was practically absent
The head of the Federation Council committee on foreign affairs Konstantin Kosachev considers that the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly was successful for Russia and does not exclude that it could become a turning point in the perception of the Russian Federation as an integral participant in the solution of global world problems.
"The uniqueness of the current 73rd session, in my opinion, is in that the rhetoric, to which we had already almost become accustomed in recent years in relation to Russia, was now much more subdued," said the senator in an interview published on Sunday by Rossiiskaya Gazeta.
He explained that in previous years the Russian Federation was sometimes "referred to as one of the three main threats to humanity, on par with Ebola fever or climate change or terrorism, Russia was among these, in any case, in the narrative of a group of western countries, which on this account spoke out quite unanimously".
At the 73rd session, emphasised Kosachev, "the subject of Russia in a negative light was practically absent".
"If one carefully analyses the speech of the president of USA, the president of France, the speech of the foreign minister of Germany, I'm not now taking Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, in any case, there was certainly no choir," the politician pointed out, noting that Russia "is no longer a kind of wall on which to practise hitting a tennis ball".
The head of the Federation Council committee does not exclude that this indicates a kind of tendency which, in his opinion, "will distinguish the current session [of the UN General Assembly], although this tendency may only fully manifest itself in a year, in two, three".
"I do not exclude that the current session in some sense may be pivotal," allowed Kosachev, explaining that "there are too many examples of how with the inclusion of Russia it is possible to move forward in international affairs".
As an example he gave the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
"At the moment, unfortunately, it is not Ukraine, but I do not doubt that in time the Russian view on the Ukrainian crisis will also be sought," the parliamentarian added.
He supposes that this is connected with the appearance of a "sensible, reasonable perception of Russia as not just a possible but integral participant in the solution of global problems of our time."
"I hope I am not mistaken, but I have a feeling that we will pass the point somewhere beyond which movement will not be backwards, it will be movement forwards," he added.
One other "interesting and important feeling" in this context Kosachev said was the "demand for the Russian view of how the modern world should develop".
"I was present at a great many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the General Assembly session] foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, I held my own meetings, and with great pleasure I saw that while one-two years or five years ago on the whole nobody was interested in the Russian opinion, the Russian view of what is happening in the world, now the situation is different," said the chair of the Federation Council committee.
In his opinion, this is due to how "the so-called new liberal order, represented by the West, does not have answers to the questions of how to solve international problems due to the obvious lack of ideas in the global space, the lack of ideas on how to solve the problems of the Middle East, problems of terrorism, problems of nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, problems of migration".
"And now the demand for the Russian view is becoming more and more obvious," Kosachev said with certainty, stressing that in this sense he considers "the current session successful for the work of the Russian delegation, successful for Russia".

Damask claimed its right to apply military force in Idlib
Damask hopes that there will be no need to apply military force in the Syrian Odlib province, claimed the Syrian minister of foreign affairs Valid Muallem.
However, he said, Syria has the right to do so.
The minister added that Turkey can quickly get the militants of Jabhat al-Nusra, which is forbidden in Russia, out of the demilitarised zone in Idlib, RIA Novosti reports.
The minister of foreign affairs also stressed that Damask will have to use military force to solve the problem to the East of Euphrates if curds express separatist intentions.
At the same time, according to Muallem, the talks with currish SDF forces went well until they were suspended because of the USA.
On September 17, Putin and the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan agreed to create a demilitarised zone along the line between the military opposition and government forces in the Syrian Idlib province by October 15.
Terry takes up the role of head of the Chelsea youth team
Earlier it was reported that the 37-year-old defender was in negotiations to move to Spartak Moscow.
RT reports, with reference to the Mirror, that the former England captain John Terry is now heading the Chelsea youth team.
According to the source, the well-known player, who has been part of the London club for a long time, will lead the team of under-23 players.
It was noted that Terry will replace coach Jody Morris, who has gone to Derby County.
In September, Terry was close to moving to Spartak Moscow, but ultimately abandoned this idea after talking to his family.
The first vice-speaker of the Verkhovna Rada, Irina Gerashchenko, apologized to the Ukrainian journalist Roman Sushchenko, who was convicted in the Russian Federation for "espionage", for not being able to release him from the dungeons.
She said this in a video message to the political prisoner recorded on the eve of the second anniversary of the illegal arrest of Sushchenko by the FSB.
According to her, during these days a protest is being held at the walls of the Russian embassy in Paris, whose participants have declared a hunger strike, while demanding the release of the Kremlin prisoners.
Every day French journalists, politicians, cultural figures, including people who know you well, are fasting in support of Oleg Sentsov, other political prisoners of the Kremlin, and of course, you.
There is not a single international meeting, not a single negotiation, not a single interview, in which the President of Ukraine, the Ukrainian government, we all, have not demanded that pressure is put on the Kremlin, that pressure is put on Putin, with one demand - Oleg’s release, Roman’s release, the release of the political prisoners of the Kremlin and the people who are being illegally detained in the occupied territories of Donbass and Crimea", - said Gerashchenko.
She also expressed confidence that these hardships will toughen up every Ukrainian, making us "angrier, tougher in protecting the national interests of Ukraine, in protecting every Ukrainian, in understanding what is good and what is evil".
We remind you that the correspondent of Ukrinform in France, Roman Sushchenko, was detained by the Russian security forces on September 30, 2016 at a Moscow airport.
On October 7, he was charged with spying for the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.
On June 4, 2018, the Moscow city court sentenced Sushchenko to 12 years in a penal colony, and the Supreme Court of Russia declared this verdict lawful.
Russian jailers granted a last request to the Ukrainian before his transfer to the colony.

"I could not even hold a spoon"
Vakhtang Kikabidze on the fight against cancer
Now many artists are talking about how they managed to beat cancer.
The disease, unfortunately, does not spare anyone, and popular people’s stories about their victories over cancer give hope to many sufferers.
The famous actor Vakhtang Kikabidze admitted that he was alive only thanks to his wife.
Many years ago he was diagnosed with a terrible diagnosis, which sounded like a sentence.
"It felt like a hammer had hit the bottom of my skull.
I fell over.
I became disorientated.
I was admitted to the hospital.
There I could not hold a spoon, could not stand, and fell over all the time.
They began to do tests, and the resuls turned out to be bad, the artery was not allowing the flow of blood.
They took me to Moscow, and there they said that there was a large purulent cyst in my head, and they did an urgent operation.
And during the operation, the doctors saw a tumor behind the cyst", - said Kikabidze in the program "Once Upon a Time".
The tumor turned out to be malignant.
Then, 37 years ago, the residents of Tbilisi even came to his doorstep to say goodbye to their idol.
But the actor's wife did not allow the living actor to be written off, she firmly believed that he could beat the disease and for over a year did not leave her beloved husband's bedside.
If it were not for Irina, I would not be alive now.
When I have faced emergency situations, she has always been there, like a rock", - the actor admitted.
The actor managed to beat the disease, and now he happily lives in his house in the center of Tbilisi.
And from time to time he denies rumors about his illness, about his untimely death, which continually appear online.
The creators of the website "Peacekeeper" added the Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó to the "Purgatory" section.
The reason was "an encroachment on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine".
In addition, the head of the MFA of the neighboring country was accused of "direct threats of invasion of Ukraine" and "support for separatist sentiments in Ukraine", as well as participation "in organizing a provocation aimed at the massive violation of Ukrainian legislation by Ukrainian citizens".
Note that ahead of Szijjártó the governor of the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra Pavel and Onufriy, the head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) were put in the "Purgatory" section.
The reason was their opposition to receiving the Tomos by the Ukrainian local church.
Earlier, commenting on the issuance of Hungarian passports to Ukrainian citizens in Zakarpattia, the President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko demanded respect for the sovereign rights of Ukraine.
Authorities named the price of the “golden parachute” for the deputy governor of Voronezh.
The deputy governor of the Voronezh region Yury Agibalov was paid 23 monthly salaries based on the regional law “On state positions”.
However, the actual size of the “golden parachute” for the official who was released from the post that he was temporarily occupying was in fact several times smaller than the sum mentioned in the media”
These clarifications were provided to the press service of the regional government.
According to the law, the monthly salary on Agibaev’s position is 11,189 roubles.
Thus, the one-off payment was 223,892 without the income tax, the press service stated, not one million, as the media reported.
The official was receiving pension starting from July 2018.
He was at the state service for more than nine years.
The payment and pension were accrued to him after he resigned, explained the regional government representative to RIA Novosti.
The addition to the pension wasn’t payed when he was at the state position, and his salary didn’t change compared to the previous period.
Aleksandr Gusev, temporarily acting as a governor won the governor elections and entered the post on September 15.
Agibalov was freed from his job in the end of his governor term.
Other officials at this position before resigned in the same way.
On September 29, the Nezygar Telegram channel published documents showing that Agibalov was payed 23 monthly salaries as he left the vice governor position, and two days later he received the same position without the “acting as” prefix.
State Duma deputy urged to talk to school children about the dangers of masturbation
Onishchenko holds the post of first deputy chairman of the committee for education and science.
Based on the experience of his work, he noted in an interview that teenagers are provoked to masturbate by harmful information they find on the internet.
It’s worth fighting against this at the level of educational institutions and families, the deputy added.
Gennady Onishchenko, deputy of the State Duma of the Russian Federation (in an interview with the radio station "Moscow Speaks":
As part of the general sexual education of children, this must be done, explaining the harm, because here there is a risk specific to the sexual health of the child, both boy and girl.
The problem is objective, it lies in the fact that children reach puberty quite early, and then a large discrepancy appears between their puberty and ability to officially enter into intersexual contact.
According to Onishchenko, "prudishness", the hushing up of "problems of a sexual age" and the lack of a culture of adequate parenting are preventing a solution to the problem.
The doctor is sure that many teenagers encounter masturbation.
The deputy believes that the provision of lessons about the dangers of masturbation is most of all worth it in the schools of "hyper-urbanized" regions.
"If we start this conversation in our Muslim republic, they will simply not understand us, to put it mildly", - said the professor.
Gennady Onishchenko is an acting academician of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, member of the Presidium of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, doctor of medical sciences, professor.
Honored doctor of Russia and Kyrgyzstan, member of the presidium of the All-Russian public organization "League of Nation's Health".

AfD is now second by popularity in Germany
The anti-immigrant “Alternative for Germany” party set a new record for popularity, while Angela Merkel’s ratings are falling.
By all accounts, Germany’s residents have started to seriously tire of Angela Merkel’s immigration policy, which has made the country a desired destination for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
Clearest of all on this matter are the latest opinion polls: Alternative for Germany keeps getting more popular, while the positions of Merkel and Seehofer, who head the two allied governing parties, are weakening.
This week the AfD set its latest record, rising to second place in popular preferences.
At 17%, the conservatives have managed to stay ahead of the social democrats, who have about 16%.
A gap of one percentage point could be attributed to statistical error, but the fact still must be noted that the AfD, which was established in 2013 out of a small group of economists and eurosceptics, was able to turn into a serious political force.
Leading in overall standing is still the CDU/CSU union of parties, which has about 30%.
But a falling trend is still observed: In April, support for Angela Merkel’s union of parties was still four percentage points higher.
The German chancellor’s personal rating is falling, while she is leading the government for a fourth term in a row.
Support now for Angela Merkel stands at 48%, which is 7% lower than last year.
We should add that after the Social Democrats are the Greens (15%), the Left (11%), and the Free Democrats (10%).
The Evolution of the “Alternative”
The Alternative for Germany party was founded in September 2012 out of the “Electoral Alternative 2013” group, which had taken in former members of the Christian Democratic Union.
The group initially arose in opposition to government policy, but early on it handled only economic issues, including problems with the euro and interactions within the EU.
The group spoke out against Germany “subsidizing” weak EU economies, and didn’t exclude the possibility of reimbursing Germany and of a full exit from the European Union.
As the immigration crisis deepened, the AfD’s platform expanded.
In 2013 the group became a full-fledged political party, which occupied the Eurosceptic niche and began to harshly criticize the government for the failure of its immigration policy.
In the last parliamentary elections in 2017, the AfD managed to enter the Bundestag for the first time, getting 94 seats (out of 709).
Two representatives of Alternative for Germany received seats in the European Parliament.
A video was published with a journalist who called the citizens of Ukraine "a nation of blockheads"
The host of a political talk show on Ukrainian TV and author of two books Ostap Drozdov admitted live that he considers his compatriots to be a "nation of blockheads".
They believe the TV and read little.
As Drozdov noted, it is difficult to live and work in such a country.
"From childhood we were not taught a culture of reading and acceptance of texts", - the journalist said.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drozdov’s words, accusing him of lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the State committee for television and radio-broadcasting of Nezalezhnaya began a campaign against literature, in which there are the slightest hints of criticism of the Kiev authorities, banning the import of whole 201 editions.

Canadians created a car to prepare for the apocalypse - Behind the Wheel magazine
Anyone who wishes can purchase this automobile.
The company Roshel Defence Solutions announced that it is already receiving orders for its armored car.
Roshel Senator APC, armored car for the apocalypse
The theme of the apocalypse is not just profitable for video game makers, film studios, and book publishers.
Now automobile companies are mastering this niche, which is new to them.
Thus, the Canadian Roshel Defence Solutions came out with its armored car for the apocalypse, the Senator APC.
In their time spent not pursuing dreams, the engineers of this company make armored cars for the police.
The Roshel Senator APC is designed for 12 passengers, who are contained in a fully welded armored capsule that lacks special comforts, but is completely secure.
This bunker (it could not be called anything else, since its armor level satisfies the B7 standard) is installed on the chassis of the powerful Ford Super Duty pickup truck.
Its bottom, also armored, can protect the capsule from grenade explosions and anti-personnel landmines.
Interior of the Roshel Senator APC, armored car for the apocalypse
In order that passengers not be harmed even by the blast wave of an explosive detonated near the automobile, the interior of the car is equipped with special shock-absorbing chairs.
Furthermore, the capsule has an autonomous ventilation and fire-extinguishing system.
For safe vision, the Roshel Senator APC is equipped with an omnidirectional camera system, including nightvision, as well as an armored lookout tower on the roof.
The automobile does not have any weapons.
The front portion of the interior of the Roshel Senator APC, armored car for the apocalypse
In order that the weight of the armored car not reduce its mobility, the Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a 330-horsepower durable turbo-diesel 6.7 liter motor, the entire power of which is transmitted to the four wheels of the armored car through a 6-speed automatic transmission.
The Roshel Senator APC simply has no chance of getting stuck
The Roshel Senator APC, armored car for the apocalypse, may be seen at a special exhibition in Washington in October.
Timeframe named for death of the Universe
The Universe will exist for approximately 140 billion more years, which is 10 times more than the age of the observed world, equal to about 13.8 billion years.
Research of an international collective of scientists was published in a library of electronic preprints and sent for publication in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, reports the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
Experts arrived at similar conclusions by using the HSC (Hyper Suprime-Cam) camera of the Subaru telescope to observe about ten million galaxies.
Tracing the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which account for more than 95 percent of the energy mass of the observed world, scientists, working within the standard cosmological model ΛCDM (Λ Cold Cold Matter), estimated the rate of expansion of the Universe, which turned out to be a little slower than previously thought.
A press release from the Observatory Subaru notes that the observations provided a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the Universe, and the recording of data from the European space telescope Planck clarified the restrictions imposed on the parameters of ΛCDM.
In July scientists modeled the possible death of the Universe.
Three years earlier their colleagues presented new conclusions supporting the view that the observed world will end its existence in 22 billion years as a result of the Big Rip.
Another attempt fails to unite the initiators of the pension referendum
The opportunity to elicit the public's opinion about pension reform has been postponed indefinitely
A meeting of the nationwide initiative group for a referendum against raising the retirement age was held in Moscow on Saturday.
Representatives of 13 subgroups took part in the meeting, putting forward proposals for the wording of questions (in total, the CEC registered five questions).
They decided to apply to the Central Electoral Commission to register a single initiative group and ask the public the question: "Are you in favor of the pension age, as established by legislation as of July 1, 2018, at which Russian citizens gain the right to an old-age pension, not being increased?"
This wording was registered by the Vologda subgroup, whose representatives did not participate in the meeting, but it was considered the simplest and legally most succinct.
Most of the meeting participants were supporters of the Fair Russia member Ilya Sviridov (six subgroups) and the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (four subgroups).
They were joined by three independent subgroups from Nizhny Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg.
Earlier, Sviridov told Vedomosti that invitations were sent to all the initiators, and representatives of about 40 subgroups expressed their agreement to take part.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, who heads the Vologda subgroup (the wording of her question was supported by another 15 subgroups), told Vedomosti that she did not receive an invitation and did not plan to take part: "It was not clear who our friend was and who our enemy".

Zinetula Bilyaletdinov: Admiral created big problems for us
Ak Bars head coach Zinetula Bilyaletdinov summed up the KHL regular season championship match against Admiral (4:2).
"It was not an easy game. It was complicated.
Our rival fought with dignity, creating us big problems.
I am happy that in general we played well today.
I have said before that the goals will start coming as long as we work on it.
And the fact that we won is also very important".

"We have our own system he works by.
Therefore we took such a decision", said Bilyaletdinov, as reported by the club's press office.

In the match between Lokomotiv and Akhmat, Turbin's errors rained down fast and furious
Former all-union referee Vladimir Levitin commented on the performance of referee Evgeny Turbin in the match of the 9th round of the Russian championship between Lokomotiv and Akhmat and assessed the controversial incidents of the game.
"How would you assess Evgeny Turbin's refereeing in the match between Lokomotiv and Akhmat?"
"I believe that the referee confirmed that he is not suitable for refereeing matches in the Russian Premier League.
It surprises me that with the mess in the fifth round game between Spartak and Dinamo, neither Turbin himself, nor the heads of Dinamo drew any serious conclusions about his lack of abilities.
The result had a quick impact on the ninth round: errors in his performance and missed calls on bad tackles rained down fast and furious.
For example, in the 50th minute, Locomotiv's Eder pushed over Akhmata defender Rodolfo in his own penalty area.
Just eight meters from the goal line, but Turbin did not call a penalty".
"How would you assess the incident with the participation of Idowu, who in the 82nd minute appeared to handle the ball?"
"I believe the defender deliberately handled the ball in his own penalty area.
Turbin was close to the incident, had a good view of it, and his assistant was to the right.
This incident should have been seen by the fourth official Sergey Karasev.
However, none of the three referees did not see it, and no penalty was awarded.
Therefore, the score was corrupted, and any sporting justice was ripped up.
It was a case in which refereeing by the rules was ousted and the sporting spirit of the game buried".
"In the 52nd minute, Turbin did not dare to send off defender Oleg Ivanov, who commited a foul in a duel with Krychowiak, and when the referee showed him a yellow card, he defiantly applauded him.
What do you think of this incident?
Was it necessary to brandish the second yellow card?"
"In this incident Turbin brandished the first yellow card in somewhat spurious circumstances.
A second would have been logic".
"Oleg Ivanov talked after the match about refereeing double standards in that some teams are awarded a penalty for such violations, as in the incident with Idowu, and others are not.
How would you assess the player's words?"
"It depends on how you interpret double standards.
It was a penalty.
But it wasn't given.
So the referee did not give a second penalty in the opposition goal.
That was the principle applied here.
And the second incident with double standards is that the referee looks at who is playing.
On Saturday Locomotiv and Akhmat played, and there have been serious complaints about Turbin's performance, because the team was put at a disadvantage".
Saturday Night Live started with Matt Damon playing Judge Kavanaugh, who has been accused of rape.
Matt Damon played US Supreme Court appointee Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first episode of the new season of NBC’s Saturday Night Live.
In a short skit, the actor played Kavanaugh at the Senate hearings where he is accused of rape.
Earlier, the Supreme Court appointee attracted attention with his emotional and detailed accounts during discussions with Senator Amy Klobuchar.
So, Kavanaugh repeatedly admitted to his love for beer, but stated that he had never drunk to the point of memory lapses.
In addition, in his attempt to vindicate himself from the rape accusation, Kavanaugh stated that in those years he had been a virgin.
Damon also played these details up.
“All I did was drink lots of beer, and I wasn’t thinking at all about sex.
I was the proudest, drunkest virgin that anyone ever saw.
Everyone knows that,” said the judge as played by Matt Damon.
Earlier Kavanaugh was confirmed as a judge for the US Supreme Court.
Barbra Streisand discovered strange behavior in her cloned dogs
American singer Barbra Streisand said that the clones of her dead dog behave completely differently from the original pet.
"They are not alike.
In fact, [the clones] look like her, but cloning the soul is impossible," emphasized the 76-year-old singer.
At the end of 2017 Streisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old dog of the Coton du Tulear breed named Samantha, which had to be put to sleep due to health problems.
In July 2018 it was reported that a dog of the chihuahua breed named Miracle Milly, which was named the smallest dog in the world, had been cloned for the 49th time.
Specialists are engaged in cloning the six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so small.
The United States has contemplated a naval blockade of Russian deliveries of oil and gas
The United States could begin a naval blockade of Russia in order to obtain an advantage on the global energy market.
The US government is so eager to fight for success on the global hydrocarbon market that it is prepared to resort to a naval blockade of Russia, which remains one of the world’s main suppliers of fuels.
US Department of the Interior head Ryan Zinke spoke yesterday of the possibility of a naval blockade.
Unlike other similarly named government agencies around the world, the department conducts not police functions, but civilian ones, and this includes carrying out policy in the area of natural resources.
For this reason, Zinke’s announcement falls entirely within his sphere of responsibility, though not without political overtones.
Appearing at an industrial event in Pittsburg, Zinke stated that with its naval forces the US controls shipping lanes in the Middle East and could block them if the need arose.
Zinke’s words could lead to the conclusion that the need may be tied to Washington’s desire to interfere with Russian deliveries on the global energy market.
Zinke mentioned that Russia still received the lion’s share of its income from world oil and gas deliveries.
He said he is sure that a desire to distribute energy shipments in the Middle East as well as Eastern Europe was the prime motive for Moscow’s expansion in this region.
The agency head made it clear that the US is still considering maintaining its leadership on the global energy market, now that it has become the largest supplier of oil and gas.
For this, Washington will have to put confine Russia and Iran, and Zinke considers a naval blockade of commercial routes to be an acceptable means to this end.
Kalmyk director receives acclaim at festival
Our fellow Russian and Gogol Center actor Yevgeny Sangadzhiev together with his film "Harmony" received a special mention from members of the jury of the Sixth Annual "Dvizhenie" Festival of Debut Films, which was held in Omsk.
The awarded festival certificate stated that "this is a signal that will earn an immediate response from large players in the film industry."
As many will know, the picture by the young Kalmyk director was presented as part of the "Movement. The Beginning" program of short films, in which eight films were entered.
The main prize in this competition program went to the picture “Yana, or Anya Written Backwards”, which was the directorial debut of actress Yana Gladkikh.
The "Dvizhenie" National Film Festival of Debut Films focuses on youth cinema. However, this is not to be understood as a reference to the age of the producers, but to their inner spiritual state and their desire and willingness to take risks.
As a graduate of the Elista Art School named after P. Chonkushov and the Russian Institute of Theatre Arts - GITIS, Yevgeny Sangadzhiev meets all these requirements.
He is young, talented, and creative, and in his work he strives to attain new non-standard forms of self-expression.
More than 300 Syrians fled the Idlib de-escalation zone in a day
The Idlib de-escalation zone in Syria was fled by 301 people, including 141 children, the Centre for Reconciliation of Opposing Sides in Syria reported on the evening of 29 September.
The evacuation took place via the Abu ed-Duhur humanitarian corridor.
The centre also said the situation in the de-escalation zone remained tense.
For example, as a result of artillery fire in the area of Makani al-Duwairi in the city Aleppo a Syrian soldier died.

A campaign is underway in Sakhalin Region to immunize the population from flu.
Doctors in the island region are urging residents to be more proactive and not to ignore the recommendations of doctors.
This year, 219,000 residents in the region are expected to be vaccinated, including at least 70 percent of all children.

Russia will produce supersonic passenger planes
Production of supersonic passenger planes will start in Russia from 2030.
This was reported by Kirill Sypalo, the CEO of the Zhukovskiy Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute.
According to him, the academic centre is working on supersonic issues both as a part of international consortiums and as a partner of the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
“We estimate that we need 3 or 4 years, to build a working prototype of this technology, and 10 to 15 years, to get production line models that would allow us to transport passengers across huge spaces of our country", - added Sypalo.
He said that Russian researchers now face the task of making the technology economically feasible and safe at the same time.
In the beginning of September, the aviation engineering company Tupolev PJSC claimed that it completed the predevelopment analysis of passenger supersonic plain. They estimate that the plain will be able to develop speed up to 1900 km/h at the height of 11 km.
This was announced by the deputy CEO of the enterprise Valery Solozubov.

He said this on air at CNN.
He said that he can only confirm the words of the Washington Post columnist that the result of Putin’s aggression against Ukraine was the unification of Ukrainians.

Now this is more than 54%.
Who did this?
Putin.
In 2013, the European integration of Ukraine and EU membership was supported by 33% of Ukrainians.
Now this is 74%.
Who did this?
Putin", - Poroshenko said.
So thank you, Mr. Putin, for making my country much more European and much more willing to defend European and transatlantic values.
And we are very sure that we will not return to the Russian Empire", - stressed the president of Ukraine.

A club has appeared in Russia that I am interested in
Former captain of Chelsea and the English national team John Terry speaks about why he attended the match of the ninth round of the Russian championship between Spartak and Rostov (0:1).
"A club has appeared in Russia that I am interested in.
I have been following the team for just a short time, and it has been interesting to observe it from the outside.
I can’t say that I’m a fan because my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I do like Spartak and want to apologize for my decision", said Terry, as reported by the Chelsea fans website.
With 18 points Rostov rose to third place in the standings, with Spartak in fifth place with 15 points.
In the next round, the red-and-whites will play Yenisey on October 7, and Valery Karpin’s team will host Orenburg a day earlier.
Expensive violin passed onto a pawnshop for pittance
When a man brought a violin to a LBC Boutique and Loan pawnshop located in the city of Somerville, Massachusetts, the pawnshop worker offered only USD 50 for the old and flimsy-looking instrument.
But an experienced store manager, Dylan McDermmitt, suspected that it was in fact an old and expensive instrument, and he decided to consult with an expert for an appraisal.
It was then discovered that the violin was made in 1759 by the famous Italian violin maker Ferdinando Gagliano and is estimated to be worth USD 250,000.
The bows alone for such violins are valued at USD 16,000–18,000.
An investigation revealed that the violin had recently been stolen from one of the residents of the city, and the instrument was then returned to its rightful owner.
It is not yet known how the person who sold the violin to the pawnshop obtained the instrument, but it is known that the seller had no criminal background.
The manager says that now everyone who brings a violin to the pawnshop will be asked to play it to make sure that it really belongs to them.
Exciting clash awaits fans in ninth round of Russian Premier League Spartak will take on Rostov at its stadium in Tushino under the leadership of Valery Karpin, a man who, as we know, is no stranger to the “people's team”.
The fact that the clubs currently have an equal number of points (15 each), occupy 3rd and 4th places in the standings, lagging behind Zenit (which has a distant lead) and only one point ahead of Dynamo, makes this match particularly significant.
The red-and-whites are going through a rough patch: the club is again plagued by idiotic scandals. Massimo Carrera's team also unexpectedly took a beating at the hands of SK Rapid Wien in the UEFA Europa League, and they recently lost to Akhmat Grozny at home.
After the match with CSKA Moscow, which ended in a fair draw, Spartak was able to beat Chornomorets Odesa with a minimum score and not without some difficulty in the championship. It is still too early to say whether the most popular club in Russia has managed its way out of its crisis.
For three games in a row Rostov has not been able to win, but it has gone undefeated now for five matches.
Let's see whether Karpin will be able to extend his team's winning streak by winning such a key match that they cannot afford to lose.
The previous meeting between Karpin's Rostov and Spartak ended in victory for the capital team.
The start of the match is set for 7:00 PM.
Aftershocks shake Indonesia after a powerful tsunami
Meteorologists have observed over 170 aftershocks in Indonesia, where an earthquake occurred several days ago, accompanied by a three-meter tsunami.
Measuring 7.4 on the Richter scale, the earthquake mainly affected the island of Sulawesi, according to the channel "Russia 24".
Over 420 people perished, and over 500 were injured.
Authorities had previously warned the population about the threat of a tsunami, but later rescinded the warning.
The fact is that sensors did not detect the approaching wave.
At this time, the fate of dozens of residents, who were preparing to celebrate a national holiday in the coastal city of Palu, the city most damaged by the elements, remains unknown.
London brought accusations against Moscow
Russia is attempting to reverse the results of the Cold War, announced the British Secretary of State for Defense Gavin Williamson.
Nevertheless, the UK will defend its values, he emphasized during speeches at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham.
Threats are mounting, Iran and North Korea are becoming more dangerous, enemies are working in grey areas using cyberattacks and fake news, added the Minister.
But the biggest of them is Russia, which is expanding its military presence in Ukraine and the Arctic region.
Moscow immediately contested these allegations by western politicians, reports TASS.
Then the British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt noted that Russia would pay a high price if it flouts international rules and uses chemical weapons.
Hunt mentioned the poisoning in the British city of Salsbury, in March of this year, of Sergey Skripal, the former Russian military intelligence officer convicted of spying for the UK, and his daughter Yulia.
In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, a referendum is being held on joining the EU and NATO, subject to changing the name of the country.
The referendum is intended to resolve the 27-year dispute with neighboring Greece over the name of the country, which coincides with the name of the neighboring Greek province.
One of the first to vote was Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, an ardent supporter of renaming the republic Northern Macedonia.
The preparations for the referendum and today's voting are being monitored by international organizations.
The head of the observation mission of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, Jan Petersen, told Euronews how the work of the observers is organized:
Approximately 100 teams dispersed across the country today to observe the entire process, from the opening of polling stations to their closure, then the counting of votes and the drawing up of reports.
During the month, 10 of our teams worked in the country, and they oversaw the preparation for the voting, the work of the media, the observance of the law on campaign financing and the organization of the referendum.
Fei Dulgeri: "About 500 foreign observers are closely monitoring the voting process.
Groups of observers are recording the events in detail and communicating with members of election commissions, in order to subsequently put the information down in the final report".
An interpreter compared Russian and German mentality
Russians and Germans have different mentality but these differences don’t prevent them from understanding each other.
Berbel Sakse, a professional simultaneous interpreter, related this on the International Day of the Translator on September 30.
Berbel Saks is engaged more than 30 years in the translations from the Russian and English languages.
Germans like to plan quietly events, and Russians, as they say in a proverb, "long harness and quickly go".
But it seems to me, for mutual understanding between the people and for work of the translator it doesn't play a major role,” she said in the interview to RIA Novosti.
According to the interpreter, “it is enough to know history” to understand that the countries can’t do without each other
In the future, Sakse noted, there’s np sense for Germany to ignore Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, there’s no sense in ignoring it.
We need Russian gas, oil, there are a lot of things that define our common destiny,” she said.
A day before the German chancellor Angela Merkel claimed that the country tries to “start relationships” with Russia and sustain them.
Especially important, she said, it the Nord Stream - 2 project constructed from the Russian coast to Germany on the bottom of the Baltic sea.

Let us remind you that the previous nights were marked by ground frost in the western and northern regions of Ukraine, as well as in the Vinnytsia region.
Putin appointed a new head of the Presidential Foreign Policy Directorate
Vladimir Putin by decree relieved Alexander Manzhosin of duties as head of the Presidential Foreign Policy Directorate.
In his place, Ivor Neverov was appointed to this post.
Mr. Manzhosin had headed the Presidential Foreign Policy Directorate since 2004.
As one of the reasons for his departure a source close to the Kremlin named personal circumstances, noting that there were no substantial complaints about the quality of his work as head of the directorate.
Igor Neverov previously headed the Second European Department of the Foreign Ministry
In 2009-2014 he was the ambassador of Russia in Sweden.
Russians donated one ruble for a deputy with low pay
In Yekaterinburg the charitable fund Chelovechek opened a collection of funds for State Duma deputy Vera Ganza, who complained about low pay.
The progress of the campaign can be followed on the site of the organization.
"The Chelovechek charitable fund expresses hope that we as the whole world can save this public servant.
We ask all empathetic people to gift a chance at life and a happy future!
All collected funds will be given personally into the hands of the poor person.
God Save You!" says a message of the fund.
In total the benefactor wants to collect 380 thousand rubles for the deputy, which is the equivalent of a month's pay.
Accounts of help received are published on the fund's page in VKontakte, where the organization posts screenshots of money transfers.
The most frequent sums of donations are one ruble and 50 kopecks.
At the time of publication Russians had donated to Vera Ganza 1633 rubles.
The collection of funds started on 28 September after Ganza's complaints of a low level of income.
In her words, the average pay of a deputy is 380 thousand rubles, from which nothing is left over, so it is necessary to spend money with a credit card.
Ganza complained that parliamentarians are not compensated for expenses.
After this in the Duma it was announced that the possibility of reimbursing expenses would be considered.
The film "Between Two Waters" was awarded the "Golden Shell" at the festival in San Sebastian
The film "Between Two Waters" (Entre dos aguas) by the Spanish director Isaki Lacuesta was recognized as the best film of the 66th International Film Festival in San Sebastian.
The film won the main award of the festival - the "Golden Shell".
The Norwegian actress Pia Tjelta was awarded the "Silver Shell" for best actress in the film "Blind Spot" (Blind Spot).
The best actor was named the Argentine Dario Grandinetti for the film "Red" (Rojo).
The director of that film, Benjamin Naishtat, was awarded the title of best director.
The comedy Night School topped the American box office.
The comedy Night School, which debuted last Friday at American movie theaters, earned $28 million on its first weekend in distribution.
This success allowed the unimaginative flick starring Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish to top the US box office for 28-30 September.
Released so far in only 20 countries, the film brought in $5.5 million, including $2 million from British viewers.
In its fight for first place, what’s remarkable is that this creation of Malcolm Lee pretty clearly got ahead of another newcomer in western distribution, the cartoon Smallfoot, a curious story of a charming yeti meeting a representative of humankind, whose existence the starring character had never believed in.
This project of directors Karey Kirkpatrick and Jason Reisig collected $23 million on its kickoff weekend, basically justifying the expectations of experts who had predicted $20-25 million for the weekend.
Regarding Smallfoot’s total box-office receipts, at the moment they amount to $38.6 million (while it has debuted already in 50 countries): Its most active market was Mexico, filling the coffers with $3.6 million.
The top three at the time was completed with the children’s tale “The House with a Clock in Its Walls,” from horror master Eli Roth. This proves conclusively that the director can produce quality movies for the 12+ audience too.
For its second week in distribution, the screen adaptation of John Bellairs’ book with the charming Jack Black and Cate Blanchett earned $12.5 million, bringing total global receipts to $53.8 million.
In spite of its departure from the top 3, the thriller A Simple Favor, with Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick, continues to be an incredible surprise: The movie was not realistically expected to perform well financially, but during 17 days in distribution in America this movie by Paul Feig collected $43 million (including $6.6 million for 28-30 October). And right now it actually has $62.9 million in total sales.
The last of the top five this week was the horror show The Nun, which raked in $5.4 million in the reporting period.
During 24 days in American (and of course other) theaters, the spin-off film The Conjuring has total earnings of $330 million and now proudly bears the title of most successful franchise movie. The franchise also includes the two parts of The Conjuring and the two films about the terrifying doll Annabelle.
The results of the past weekend show that right after this Corin Hardy horror movie comes one more from that genre, the newly-appeared Hell Fest, which is one of the major youth horrors of the year.
On its first weekend the movie earned $5.1 million in the US. It is the brainchild of the famous film editor and now director Gregory Plotkin, who has previously worked on a set of big horror projects including Happy Death Day, which Hell Fest in some parts strongly resembles.
The result is extremely positive when compared to the film’s modest budget.
The seventh was Crazy Rich Asians ($4.15 million), which seems unlikely to fall out of the American box office top 10. The romantic comedy has now been on screen for seven weeks, and for September it’s the sixth-highest-grossing film of the genre in history, with $165.7 million.
That’s exactly the amount the movie has earned so far on the domestic market; its total revenue is now $218.8 million.
The last three of the US top ten by revenue for 28-30 September were The Predator, White Boy Rick, and Peppermint — last weekend they earned $3.7 million, $2.38 million, and $1.1 million, respectively.
We’ll add that next weekend in the US, the long-awaited Venom with Tom Hardy will be in full swing. It will without a doubt take over the leading position in the American box office on the first weekends of October.
Of the other premieres of the coming week, the musical drama A Star Is Born deserves special mention. This movie by Bradley Cooper won at the Venice Film Festival. And also the crime drama The Hate U Give.
The head of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs paid tribute to Nazi victims in Italy

This year the ceremony was attended by the head of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs Heiko Maas.
He said that "with deep sorrow and great shame" he bows down before the murder victims and their families.
Maas promised to challenge nationalism with the struggle for freedom, mutual respect and friendship between Italy and Germany.
Together with the German minister, his Italian colleague Enzo Moavero-Milanese arrived in Marzabotto.
The head of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs emphasizes that the heads of the foreign affairs agencies are attending the ceremony together for the first time, and this symbolizes the desire of both countries to preserve the memory of past crimes.

Valery Belov: God helped Sibir today
The head coach of Vityaz Valery Belov speaks about the defeat at the hands of Sibir (3:4) in the KHL regular season championship match.
“A colleague spoke about the Sibir fans, and I want to draw attention to our fans”, said Belov, as reported by the Vityaz official website.
"I hope they will continue to support us in the same way, because now we have a full stadium and a great atmosphere in almost every game.
In the game, perhaps, God helped Sibir today, because they made bad mistakes, especially our leaders.
Actually our leaders lost the matchup 0:3, so it was difficult for us to get back into this match, although we had opportunities.
Nevertheless, I will take the blame.
Because apparently we missed something during our preparations
This was a different team to the one in the last match".
"This is ugly nepotism"
The audience is outraged by the choice of Agutin on the show "Voice"
The viewers of the show "Voice 60+" accuse the mentor Leonid Agutin of "ugly nepotism and brazen sham".
When in blind auditions he recognized the voice of his father Nikolay Agutin from the first notes, many hoped that he would remain neutral and not turn to the performer.
But filial feelings took over, and he picked a relative for his team.
Then many considered it a joke, but forgave the mentor bias at the first stage.
But the "joke" dragged on, and the star's father absolutely unjustifiably took the place of more worthy performers.
And now the viewers are not ready to forgive Agutin for such an injustice.
Yesterday we, the viewers of the show, were outraged by nepotism by the ugly and frank dragging our close relatives onto the final ladder.
I even doubted that Agutin had the stamina and sense of conscience to not drag his dad to the end all the way to first place", - discussed Irina Petrovskaya and Ksenia Larina in the program "Person from the TV".
Meanwhile, for the sake of his father, Leonid Agutin "ejected" wonderful performers who actually sang, while Nikolai Petrovich whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining that the viewers still want to see his father in the show.
But, as it turned out, this is not at all the case; the viewers want an objective assessment and to see genuinely talented performers in the final, and now Agutin has discredited the show.
"I sympathize with the participants of "Voice" from the Agutin team - they were doomed".
"Last time, Agutin showed how he loves his dad, but today he had to prove himself as a professional".
"The competition has lost its meaning".
"Remove two talented people from the project and leave your father in the project who does not sing but whispers, how do you call a mentor after this?",
"You like how your dad sings, then organize a concert in the Kremlin with your money and see how many people come to this concert".
This is the show "Voice", and not the show "Big Shot Relatives".
"On the part of Agutin, this was unprofessional".
"Then you have to offer dad to perform on your own show, and not on a show that is made with the money of Channel 1".
"This was a real chance for someone, and he took someone's place.
And I don’t understand why the voiceless dad should evoke a greater appreciation than any other participant with real vocal skills.
Why was the worker from Surgut with a magnificent voice and timbre ejected, and Agutin's father brought to the finals?
And then we all complain that for decades there are the same faces on the stage and on the screens!
Yes, because you cannot break through nepotism!"
"What did you expect?
This is Russia!
Cronyism and nepotism everywhere.
And the money in the family budget will come in handy!
The theater of the absurd continues!"
The users also recalled that in one of the seasons of the traditional "Voice", the son of Gradsky took part in blind auditions.
Then in no way did it occur to the mentor to take his son into his own team.
Moreover, he said: "Come on, get out of here, everything is clear".
Agutin could not act like a professional.
Canadian military servants are granted permission to wear beards for raising the spirit
Canadian defence ministry allowed military servants to wear beards.
According to the CBC channel, the bill contains instructions on how to take care about the beard.
It mentions that the servants may be ordered to shave “because of safety reasons”.
The beard can be up to 2 cm long, it must be neatly cut, the neck and cheekbone must be shaved.
The fleet servants are allowed to wear beards only on land.
The novelty is expected to “raise the moral spirit in the army and attract more Canadians to the military service.”

Previously, it was reported that the policemen in France were allowed to wear beards and tattoos.
At the same time, the court in Egypt supported the decision to fire policemen who wear beards.

Companies and bureaucrats are threatened with the punishment if they do not timely submit data on a building under construction to the Uniform Housing Construction Information System.
This innovation will help those who decided to purchase an apartment in a new building, but are worried about the developer going bankrupt.
This was discussed at a conference in Saint Petersburg for representatives of the construction industry.
Due to amendments to the law on shared housing, developers must be fulled credited in a bank.
Many experts have already started talking about a potential sharp price increase for apartments.
However, as it turns out, not everyone agrees with this.
In the center of Kiev, a robber threatened a man with a knife, forcing him to withdraw money from an ATM.
The incident occurred on the evening of September 29 on the street Ivana Kudri, reported city law enforcement officers.
According to the victim, the unknown person approached him and initiated a conversation, but then suddenly grabbed a knife and demanded he give him money and his mobile phone.
Since the victim had no cash, the stranger ordered him to withdraw money with his bank card.
After the attacker received 4 thousand hryvnias and the telephone, he hit the victim and disappeared", - the report says.
The law enforcement agencies managed to detain the robber, he was a 25-year-old from Kiev.
He now faces up to seven years in prison.
Also, the police are working on a line of enquiry of the attacker's involvement in other similar crimes.
Let us remind you that the day before in Odessa there were several high-profile robberies of cash couriers.
In one case, armed robbers were caught with the help of a drone.
A scientist spoke about a possible scientific expedition program of the Russian Federation to the Moon
The head of the Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, associate member of the Russian Academy of Sciences Anatoly Petrukovich talked to RIA Novosti about a possible research program for Russian cosmonauts to the Moon.
According to him, the scientific community is now developing directions for such activities.
"There is no consolidated opinion yet", - the scientist emphasized.
He noted that one of the options is to place a low-frequency radio telescope on the far side of the Moon, which would help to avoid interference that originates from the Earth.
"This is the only place where such a telescope can be deployed to research cosmic sources of radio waves", - Petrukovich added.
He also believes that the Moon could be used for testing robotics, to use local resources for construction.
In addition, cosmonauts should be engaged in the search for primitive organic matter on the Earth’s satellite, the scientist believes.
This could help us work out how life comes into being on planets.
Earlier, the head of the "Roscosmos” corporation said that in an optimistic scenario the Russian Federation could carry out a manned mission to the Moon by 2030.
Offended customer dumps basket with feces at the 7-Eleven store
Damian Simms, a 41-year-old resident of St. Petersburg, Florida, harbored a grudge against the manager of a 7-Eleven 24-hour convenience store: in May Simms was ejected from the store by the manager for inappropriate behavior.
So Simms decided to get back at his enemy in an original way.
At half past one in the morning, he entered the store and dumped the contents of the basket that he brought with him partly on the floor as well as partly on the products on the shelves.
The basket contained feces and urine, which Simms "borrowed" from a nearby porta toilet.
Police who arrived at the scene of the incident arrested the "avenger."
He was booked into jail and was released by posting bail of USD 300 pending trial.
He was charged with unlawful trespassing onto another person's property and a criminal offense, and he was also forbidden to enter the store again or to approach the manager.
Although Simms's crime seems more ridiculous than serious, his court sentence could be quite harsh, since he is a repeat offender: he has been charged with grand larceny, robbery, illegal possession of a weapon, drunk driving, and animal abuse.

"German Mikhailovich, how do you rate Yerofeyev's performance?"
"You know, I think he played great.
It was emotional, nothing over-the-top, just as we asked of him.
He attacked hard and created opportunities, such as the chance with Vitaly Kravtsov, when he failed to score with the net wide open.
For his first game it was an impressive performance.
I think that he will play in future games.

Zinke also noted that the situation with Iran is the same.
According to the secretary, it can e solved either economically or in a military way.
He would prefer to avoid the former, so he has to press Iran and push out Iran’s energy resurces.

There was nothing I could do and it was really difficult
Sergey Sirotkin: There was nothing I could do and it was really difficult
Williams driver Sergey Sirotkin from Russia commented on the result of the Grand Prix of Russia.
"To be honest, I don't really want to say what is on my mind.
I had a good start, but in the second turn I got caught between two cars which immediately sandwiched me.
I instantly lost all the gains that I had made at the start.
I ended up in a really bad position.
I was stuck in traffic.
We hoped that after the others took a pit stop, there would be clean air and the pace would step back up, but the tires were worn out.
He also fought with his partner, with whom he also made contact.
As I understand, he made a few mistakes.
We ended up in such a situation on the track which is the hardest of all to overtake on, I could not do anything, and it was very difficult to be honest.
I do not want to talk about it anymore", said Sirotkin to RIA Novosti.
Sirotkin finished 18th in the Russian Grand Prix. The winner was the British Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton.
Tarpishev said the removal of Glushakov and Eshchenko from the starting lineup of Spartak was absurd
Russian Tennis Federation President Shamil Tarpishev commented on the removal of soccer players Denis Glushakov and Andrei Eshchenko on Moscow’s Spartak team from training with the starting lineup after a “like” on a criticism of the team’s head trainer Massimo Carrera, says Sport Weekend.
Carrera’s actions were absolutely absurd.
To pay attention to things like that is utter stupidity.
I absolutely disagree with what Carrera is doing.
It only deepens the discord on the team.
And first of all, it was just poems. You can interpret them any way you like.
If I were in Carrera’s place I wouldn’t have reacted at all.
After all, everyone has their own opinion.
And second, everybody wants to brag.
If Glushakov and Eshchenko post “likes,” that doesn’t mean they have something against the trainer.
I think that Italian isn’t flexible enough in his perception of the situation.
And that doesn’t help create a positive atmosphere on the team.
Spartak doesn’t have a game today, so there’s no reason to blow this whole thing out of proportion.
Maybe he should have just laughed with them about it.
There’s a lot about Spartak that isn’t right. They haven’t gotten their act together after the younger players came on the team.
“Judging from all of this,” Tarpishev is sure that “this isn’t boosting optimism before the game.”
The two teams will play on 30 September starting at 7:00pm Moscow time.
John Terry, fired earlier from Spartak, led the young Chelsea team.
The “Sirius” students discussed nature-like technologies with researchers
The students of the education centre “Sirius” in Sochi, participating in the School of agrobiology and plants genetics, visited a lecture of National research centre “Kurchatov institute”.
The lecture was a part of Global international forum of convergent and nature-like technologies organised inSochi at the instruction of the Russian president Vladimir Putin, says the education centre’s site on September 29.
The lecture was opened with a documentary “Kurchatov’s codes”, in which the institute’s president member of the Russian Academy of Sciences Mikhail Kovalchuk told about global challenges that drive the development of civilisation.
The lecture was published on the “Sirius” site.
The school students learned that modern technologies need a lot of energy.
Alternative sources can’t produce this amount of energy yet.
Nature-like technologies that are being developed by the young scientists, will solve this problem, say the forum’s organisers.
Apart from this Kovalchuk talked about risks and responsibility when developing nature-like technologies.
“The advent of such technology is a unique phenomenon and a huge benefit.
They mean an explosion in medical technologies, improvement of the life quality and infrastructure.
But there is another side.
Development of nature-like technologies is in fact reproducing the live nature’s systems.
There is another side - it is an intended interference in the man’s life.
Risks are everywhere.
When a car appeared, people started dying under its wheels.
But we still use cars.
All technologies are double-sided.
When I am creating a medical technology, I may be at the same time creating a weapon of mass destruction, said the scientist cited by REN TV.
After the film screening and discussion about the recent scientific achievements, the students asked questions to the participants of the meeting.
The speakers were the candidate of physics and mathematics, head of Kurchatov complex of nature-like technologies Yulia Dyakova and the head of Nano- Bio- Info- Cognitive and Social sciences and technologies (NBICS) complex of Kurchatov institute Vyacheslav Demin.
The education centre “Sirius” in Sochi was created by the education foundation “Talant and success” on the basis of the Olympics infrastructure at the instruction of president Vladimir Putin.
The centre is aimed at discovery, development and professional support of gifted children.
Earlier in September it was reported that the winners of all-Russia online competition on information safety “Cyberchallenge” will be granted a chance to study in “Sirius”.
An air traffic controller saved a passenger plane during an earthquake in Indonesia at the cost of his own life
Indonesia bid farewell to air traffic controller Antonius Gunawan Agung, who saved hundreds of Batik Air passengers at the cost of his own life.
On September 28th he was working at the Palu's Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport on the island of Sulawesi.
An airliner was preparing for takeoff at the moment the powerful earthquake struck.
Agung refused to abandon the air traffic control tower, and helped the airplane take off.
When the magnitude of the quake reached 7.4, the tower started to collapse.
The 21-year old air traffic controller was forced to jump from a height of four stories.
Upon landing he suffered serious trauma to his internal organs, and doctors were unable to save him.
Russian submarine Kazan frightened USA
The greatest danger for the fleet of the USA is posed by the Russian submarine Kazan.
So said American Rear Admiral Dave Johnson, Rosbalt reports citing The National Interest.
“We’ll be facing tough potential opponents.
One only has to look at the Severodvinsk," he said, pointing at a predecessor model of the Kazan.
In the opinion of the commander of US Naval Forces Europe James Foggo, Russia has concentrated its efforts on modernizing its submarine fleet.
Macedonia: the referendum failed due to the low turnout
The referendum was intended to endorse the agreement of the authorities in Athens and Skopje to rename the Balkan country to "Northern Macedonia".
Greece objected to the use by the Macedonians of the name of its historical province.
The renaming offered prospects for the former Yugoslav Republic to open a way to NATO and later the EU.
But, as the EFE agency reports, the just 34% turnout at the Sunday plebiscite "did not reach" the constitutional threshold of 50%.
However, since the referendum was only advisory in nature, the authorities in Skopje may decide not to reject the renaming.
Speaking soon after the closure of the polling stations, the prime minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, a supporter of changing the name of the republic, said that if among the votes cast there are more "yes" votes, then Macedonia will change its name, despite the quorum not reached.

Residents of Kemerovo outraged by flock of sheep in cemetery
On September 30, a message was posted on a frequented social network page devoted to Kemerovo by an eyewitness stating that livestock freely roam one of the local cemeteries.
A fairly large sized herd of animals has been browsing between the fences and are eating the grass.
Commentators expressed various opinions: some local residents noted that a few livestock in the small cemetery causes no harm to anyone, and their appetite could even help clear the area of weeds and mow the grass. Nevertheless, some residents of the city are not enamored of the animals.
One outraged resident of Kemerovo posted (style preserved): "This is a burial place, not a pasture.
Sheep have no business being there.
Of course, you can't say that the sheep are commiting an act of blasphemy, but that's not the point."
In any event, one of the eyewitnesses noted that the problem of the presence of the animals in the middle of the cemetery is already known, and the necessary measures will be taken soon.
'Davlet’ (to exert pressure) or 'dovlet' (to loom over) - which is correct?
The word 'davlet' does not exist.
'Dovlet' is correct.
The word "davlet" with the meaning of "draw towards, exert influence, an impact" exists only phonetically, because we hear the sound [a] instead of [o] in the word "dovlet".
We use this word believing that it comes from the word for pressure ('davlenie').
But "pressure" and "loom over" are etymologically not only not close and are even in some sense opposed in meaning.
Have a think about that for yourself.
'Dovlet' (to loom over) (liturgical, literary, obsolete) means "quite, complete, enough, to be sufficient for someone or something, to satisfy".
It is related to the words 'dovolstvovatsya' (to be content) and 'udovolstvie' (pleasure).
Previously, it also had the meaning of "not to depend on anything, to be self-contained" - "to prevail over oneself".
The Old Slavonic "довьлѣти" ('dovleti') is akin to the words "command" and "will".
"Davit" (to crush), "podavlyat" (to suppress) are completely different.
These words have genuinely creepy "relatives": daos - "wolf" (crushing sheep), deyja - "to die" and dvaidī - "to oppress".
The similar phonetic appearance of the words "davlenie" ("pressure") and "davlet" ("to loom over"), as well as the inevitable obsolescence of the latter, forced them to contaminate one another.
So we had this very "d[a]vlet’", which is also used in writing with an "a", which, really, is incorrect and impossible from the point of view of the processes of the origin and development of these words.
So, it's correct to write "dovlet" ("to loom over").
But this word is obsolete and in its correct meaning it is no longer used.
If you want to note that any circumstances/people exert a negative impact on you from above, use the word "davit" ("to oppress").
You can also use the construction "exert pressure", but remember that this sounds bureaucratic.
Russia was the leader in the EuroSkills championship in Budapest
The Russian national team was the leader in the EuroSkills European professional skills championship.

Our car is noticeably slower than Mercedes
The Ferrari driver Kimi Raikkonen speaks about the Russian Grand Prix qualification round, in which he came fourth.
"Kimi, today did you have the chance to fight for the pole?
How did the car perform?
"It looks like Mercedes were much faster today", said Raikkonen, as reported by F1News.Ru.
But the performance of our car was the best since the beginning of the weekend".
"During qualifying you were no slower than Sebastian Vettel, but in the end the gap was still quite large.
What was the reason for that?"
"I wasn't doing badly, but then one of the Mercedes drivers got ahead.
He was preparing to overtake and manged to get round me, and this evidently lost me some time.
However, it is unlikely this greatly affect the result"
"It is very difficult to overtake in Sochi. Will the start of the race be the key moment?"
Basically you never know how things will turn out.
In any case it won't be easy, because our car is noticeably slower than Mercedes".

I am a simple volunteer and I want only one thing - to save lives
The authorities plan to allocate large sums of money to rebuild infrastructure and provide assistance to those affected.
Here they are trying to organize the distribution of food, drinking water, medicines and other essentials, but despite the measures taken, there is not enough humanitarian aid for everyone.
Hungry people are taking food from destroyed shops right in front of the police, who are not in a position to prevent this.
In the city of Palu, the airport reopened only on Sunday.
From here, a military cargo plane evacuated 200 people to Makassar - first of all, the wounded, and also tourists who had come here and who could not return home.

A friendly person gave a kid exclusive parking - Behind the Wheel magazine
Miracles are always happening in our life!
The German journalist Christie Dietz discussed one of them on Twitter.
She wrote on her page that her four-year old son parked his balance bike (children's bicycle without pedals) on the same lamppost all year.
One morning, a small sticker appeared on the lamppost with a photograph of the green bike and the inscription: "Only".
The delight of mother and child was boundless.
Christie thanked the anonymous benefactor and praised him for his interesting and fresh idea.
Her tweet quickly spread through social networks and made many people smile.
Comments to it were also remarkable:
"This is miraculous!"
"Thank you for beautiful communication in this world."
"I think there are few people in the world capable of such an act."
"Unfortunately, they do not draw the same attention as the mischief of scoundrels."
"This is the world that we need!"
Readers asked the journalist to tell them if she ever manages to find out who had the idea to put the sticker there.
Of course the culprit, by all appearances, must have been somewhere nearby: he saw the boy park his bicycle more than once before the idea occurred to him.

Russian bailiffs demanded a debt from a dead old woman
In Kurgan court enforcement officers demanded that a long-dead woman repay a state duty of 200 rubles.
Ural Meridian reported about this.
In mid-September relatives of the deceased Maria Mitrofanovna Slepneva received a letter from the Kurgan department of bailiffs, in which it was said that in relation to the 105-year-old woman enforcement proceedings had been initiated.
According to the court verdict the woman must pay 200 rubles to the local tax inspectorate.
After receiving the letter relatives of Slepneva contacted the department for explanations.
The department of bailiffs promised to sort out the situation.
Users of social networks, having found out about what happened, advised the relatives to submit counterclaims for nonpayment of the pension and social benefits to the old woman for the years "lived" after death.
In 2016 in Kemerovo a court recognized as alive a man who according to documents was considered dead.
The death notice was supposed to be assigned to his namesake, but by mistake the notice was done for the wrong person.

Vuchich implemented the highest level of battle readiness for the Serbian Army
Serbian President Alexander Vuchich ordered the implementation of the highest level of battle readiness, to which the country's Armed Forces were brought due to the situation in the north of the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija.
"The President ordered the highest level of battle readiness to be maintained, and it will be cancelled by a separate order," Serbian Defense Minister Alexander Vulin announced on Sunday, whose words are cited by TASS.

Numerous immigrant communities and anti-racist organisations filed an open letter demanding the minister’s resignation.
Russia protected itself from terrorists with its operation in Syria
After three years of Russian military operations in Syria, approximately 100,000 terrorists have been killed, of which 85,000 were killed by the Russian Aerospace Forces.
This was discussed in connection with the third anniversary of the start of the Russian military operation in Syria by the former commander in chief of the Aerospace Forces, the head of the Federation Council Committee on Defence and Security Viktor Bondarev.
He noted the high accuracy of airborne weaponry: Aerospace Forces have precisely struck and continue to precisely strike all their terrorist targets.
In Bondarev's words, after three years in Syria tens of thousands of terrorist targets have been destroyed - including, for example, ammunition stockpiles, fortifications, and headquarters.
Russian airstrikes broke the jihadists' defences - this was a decisive investment in the advance of Syrian government forces, reports Interfax.
In this regard, in the words of Bondarev, the operation of our forces in Syria allowed the protection of Russia itself from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the start of the operation in Syria over two thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including the "Islamic State" (IS, prohibited in Russia) and "Jabhat al-Nusra" (prohibited in Russia).
According to the data of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, four thousand IS fighters are Russian citizens and around five thousand are citizens of post-Soviet countries, reports TASS.
This figure refers only to those people who have been identified, and does not taken into account those who were not identified, Bondarev emphasized.
The majority of them were trained and prepared to take up arms at any moment, and Russian passports gave them the right to freely enter the territory of our country.
Thus, remarked Bondarev, in Syria Russia fights international terrorism abroad - otherwise this evil would "spill over onto us."
Phone numbers of Boris Johnson and a number of British ministers exposed

For example, in the profile of the minister for the environment, ecology and rural affairs Michael Gove his photograph was replaced with a photo of media magnate Rupert Murdoch.
Syria accused USA of supporting terrorism
The head of the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Walid Muallem accused the USA and its partners of war crimes in Syria and support of terrorism.
[The Western] coalition completely destroyed the Syrian city of Raqqa, it destroyed the infrastructure and public services in areas against which its actions were aimed, it committed mass murder of the civilian population, including children and women.
These murders according to international law are war crimes," he said.
In Muallem's words, USA and their partners showed "direct support for terrorists", since the goals of fighters and the western coalition in Syria coincided and presupposed "sowing chaos, death and destruction along its path".
The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also noted that the battle with terrorists in Syria was practically completed, and in the country it had become safer and more stable.
Muallem added that Damascus intends to also cleanse Syria of illegal foreign presence, and the priority in reconstruction the country will be given to Syrian partners.
In September the head of the Russian center for reconciliation of the warring parties in the republic lieutenant-general Vladimir Savchenko announced that two American F-15 planes had launched strikes on the Syrian province Deir ez-Zor with banned white phosphorus munitions.
USA denied all accusations.
The President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko believes that while respecting the sovereignty of other states, Ukraine has the right to demand the same respect for its own sovereignty.
The head of state said this during a trip to the Kharkiv region, commenting on the issuance by Hungary of their passports in Zakarpattia.
By protecting Ukrainian citizens, I defend the sovereignty of our state.
Just as we respect the sovereignty of other states, we demand the same respect for Ukraine", - said Poroshenko.
According to Poroshenko, he as president will protect Ukrainian citizens, no matter where they are - in the east or the west of the country.
At the same time, the head of state supported the position of the MFA in the passport scandal with Hungary, which is the intention to expel the consul of this country from Berehove.
"I fully agree with every letter that was said by the MFA", - the President noted.
As reported by "FACTS", on September 19, a video appeared on the internet, which recorded the time of issuance of Hungarian passports to Ukrainian citizens at the Hungarian Consulate in Beregovo.
At the same time, they openly took the oath of allegiance to Hungary.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Pavel Klimkin, noted that the consul of Hungary, who is featured on the video distributing Hungarian passports to Ukrainians, must leave Ukraine either by decision of Budapest itself, or he will be expeled by Kiev.
It also became known that the prosecutor's office of the Zakarpattia region opened a criminal case on the issuance of Hungarian passports.
The incident comes under the "Treason" clause.
Putin secretly flew to Siberia
It is known that Vladimir Putin spent the last two days in Dushanbe, where he took part in the work of the Council of CIS States, and also held a number of bilateral meetings with presidents of neighboring countries.
Data on the flights of the Russian "Board No. 1" on the Flightradar website indicate that at around 6 pm Tajik time on September 28, the Il-96-300 took off from Dushanbe airport and headed for the northeast.
In the area of Lake Balkhash, the aircraft's transponder was turned off.
The direction of its flight suggests that the liner could have flown to Khakassia.
According to information from the agency "Baikal24", the head of the region Victor Zimin personally met the president in Abakan on the night of September 29.
According to unofficial information, Putin flew to the republic to spend the weekend. However, site sources believe that the true reason is the "second round problem".
Next Sunday in Khakassia, the second round of the elections of the head of the region will take place.
Valentin Konovalov (CPRF) and the current head of the republic Viktor Zimin ("United Russia") entered it.
However, on September 21, Zimin withdrew his candidacy.
In the upcoming round, together with Konovalov, Andrey Filyagin ("A Just Russia") should take part.
The Khakassia media suggest that Putin may accept the resignation of the head of Khakassia and appoint a new acting head of the republic, and also take a decision on the fate of Zimin.
Putin already visited Khakassia in January of this year.
Along with Tuva, this republic is one of the president’s favorite vacation spots.
More than 10 million Syrians have become refugees since the beginning of the seven-year armed conflict in Syria.
About five million people fled to other countries, primarily to neighboring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.
Now, according to Damascus, the hostilities are nearing an end, and the country is ready for the voluntary return of refugees.
This was announced by the foreign minister of Syria Walid al-Muallem, speaking at the UN: "At present, the situation on the ground has become more stable and secure thanks to the successes achieved in the fight against terrorism.
The government is continuing reconstruction work in areas destroyed by terrorists, returning them to normal life.
All the conditions have been created for the voluntary return of Syrian refugees to the country, which they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions that made life difficult for people and deprived them of their livelihoods.
The Syrian authorities also urged the global community to facilitate the return of refugees and to allocate funds for this.
Meanwhile, the United States and the countries of the European Union refuse to provide assistance to Syria, stating that first a political solution to the conflict must be found.
"Volkswagen" admitted its guilt in full in "dieselgate" in January 2017.
In December last year, Oliver Schmidt, one of the managers of the American division of the company, was sentenced to seven years in prison.
The Group's losses are estimated to be at least 25 billion euros.
This figure includes not only fines and compensation.
By June next year, the automaker is obliged to buy or fix 85% of the cars involved in the scandal.
In February, the company management stated that the obligations had already been fulfilled in relation to 83% of cars, so the program would be completed ahead of schedule.
"Volkswagen" is trying hard to compensate for losses and regain customer confidence.
So, recently the management of the Group changed again, and large-scale restructuring and fundamental changes to the management system were announced.
Furthermore, "Volkswagen" promises to buy even new cars if German cities ban diesel engines on their streets: the authorities gained this right in February of this year.

Metropolitan Hilarion compared the decision of Kiev to rename the UOC with actions of fasists
The head of the synodial Department of External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church Metropolitan Hilarion compared the renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of fascists in relation to Jews.
"It is the equivalent of how in fascist Germany they pinned a yellow star on Jews, it means marking the Church as an enemy organization, and precisely for that purpose this draft legislation was created," said the metropolitan in a broadcast of the television channel Rossiya-24 (quote from Interfax).
In his opinion, this step will have the most serious consequences right now, when the Russo-Ukrainian conflict is at an acute stage.
Kiev in this way hopes to receive full control over the UOC and "outlaw it", considers the clergyman.
"It is a Ukrainian church, and the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainian, they are patriots of their country," he added.
Earlier it became known that deputies of the Verkhovna Rada are working on implementing draft bill No. 4128 (on changing the governance of religious organizations), No. 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations,) and No. 5309 (on renaming religious organizations).
The latter proposes renaming the UOC of the Moscow Patriarchate.
Vicar of Holy Dormition Pochayiv Lavra calls for protection of Orthodoxy and Ukrainian shrines
The Vicar of the Holy Dormition Pochayiv Lavra Metropolitan Vladimir called for the protection of the Orthodox faith and Ukrainian holy places.
The text of his appeal to followers of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) was published on Saturday on the monastery's website.
As the metropolitan noted, "Christians have been called upon to confess their faith and protect their shrines at different times in the history of our predecessors and spiritual brethren.
In light of the situation that has developed, and based on the information that we have obtained as well as the threats of reprisals that are spreading, it is clear that we are being called on to live through a period of adversity as well.”
He called for prayers and other forms of moral support.
In addition, the vicar of the Lavra emphasized that "your physical presence will also likely be required."
The priest added: "Lenin's spiritual grandchildren are threatening reprisals, and therefore we need to defend our shrines."
The message states: "As people who care about the fate of the Pochayiv Lavra, an Orthodox Ukrainian shrine and holy place of worldwide significance, we must be ready to defend it."
The Metropolitan urged his followers not to be taken in by those who mislead believers.
The vicar continued, "The UOC has canonical status, as was determined by the Tomos of October 29, 1990, that was issued by the Mother Church.
And now someone wants to make us dependent on the newly styled Patriarch Bartholomew, who is a friend of the Roman Catholic pope.
This new style with the consequences that it entails is unacceptable to us Orthodox.
We are pleased with the status that our church already has."
He recalled that since October 1990, the UOC has been canonically independent as well as completely administratively independent:
"It is in no way administratively or financially accountable to the Moscow Patriarchate.
In fact, our church already has a tomos.
What further Tomos do we need?" The metropolitan of the Holy Dormition Pochayiv Lavra Vladimir urged believers and all citizens of the country to ask themselves: if other confessions have a Tomos, does that make them independent of the Vatican?
The priest emphasized, "Believers have already understood and decided which church they will attend.
However, someone wants to sow hostility and discord once again.
Some are stung with envy of the churches and their shining domes, and they want to destroy them."
The Holy Dormition Pochayiv Lavra is the largest church and monastery complex in western Ukraine.
The monastery sits atop the Pochayiv hill 70 km from Ternopil.
The first historical records of it date to the beginning of the 13th century.

I think that if we continue to play like that, the victories will come
Dynamo Moscow head coach Vladimir Vorobyev - about “Avtomobilist”'s defeat (0:1) in the KHL regular season championship match.
“It was a good game, an interesting one, though it only lasted until a goal", “Avtomobilist” official website quotes Vorobyev.
"We tried to play very simple.
Liked the first period very much.
Didn't take advantage of some good chances.
In the second period, our rival pressed hard, but we survived.
But the ejections “fed” us a bit.
The guys played really well, carried out the coach’s instructions.
I think that if we continue to play like that, the victories will come.
Did not score, and with no goals you cannot win a game, but the very content of the game was right.
Success will come if we continue to play in this direction".
“In your opinion, did “Avtomobilist” improve from the game in Nizhny Novgorod?"
“The foreign team did not play there.
During pre-season, the teams worked on other task, many young guys did play.
I think that was a completely different game, different hockey.
“Avtomobilist” is a good, top quality team.
Judging by the tournament table, the team is playing well.
Good hockey, a great atmosphere in the arena as well as in the city.
We can only wish them good luck.
The team is moving in the right direction.
There’s many good players, and leaders.
A top quality defense and good goalkeeper.
It was difficult, we trained hard.
We knew that the team was unbeaten, we wanted to break their run, but it wasn't to be".

According to Valery Bogdanov, chairman of the Public Council at the Directorate of the Federal Marshals Service of Russia for the Republic of Kalmykia, practically every citizen in the region owes back debt on utility bills, traffic police fines, bank loans, and other forms of credit, and no one is immune from unforeseen situations.
But debtors can expect to face negative consequences in the form of a ban on leaving the country, for example.
That is why the Directorate of the Federal Marshals Service of Russia for the Republic of Kalmykia recommends that everyone who has planned a trip abroad check with their local marshalls service or on the website www.r08fssprus.ru for information about any unpaid debts and pay them off before traveling.
The service has created a “Database of Enforcement Proceedings” for the convenience of its citizens.
This special electronic application not only can be accessed via the regional websites of the directorates of the Federal Marshals Service of Russia, but also on social networks and mobile devices, including iPads, iPhones, and other smartphones.
Delgir Bodgayeva, assistant to the chairman of the Directorate of the Federal Marshals Service of Russia for the Republic of Kalmykia, explains that the database contains information about enforcement proceedings initiated by Kalmyk police officers against all debtors.
"If there are debts, the system displays information about the number of them; the date of initiation of enforcement proceedings; the name of the agency that issued the enforcement order or other certificate; the certificate number, the amount and type of debt; the address of the marshalls service; the full name of the marshall/enforcement officer; and the contact phone number.
Information on the status of enforcement proceedings can also be obtained on the state services portal at: http://epgu.gosuslugi.ru"

The main Macedonian opposition leader refused to vote on the referendum
On Sunday, September 30th, in Macedonia, a referendum will take place on the question of an inter-governmental agreement with Greece on renaming the Republic of Macedonia.
Citizens must answer one question: "Do you support membership in the EU and NATO, making an agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Republic of Greece?"
Nevertheless, the leader of the main opposition party "Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization - Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity" (IMRO - DPMNU) Christian Mitskosky announced that he would not vote on the referendum.
As announced by the party press secretary Naum Stoilkovsky, Mitskosky decided to abstain from voting in order to express their disagreement with the agreement, which he considers "detrimental."
According to the press secretary, the current referendum decides the issue of renaming the country and nothing more, since the strategic goal of the party is to achieve NATO and EU membership.
A week ago, the President of Macedonia George Ivanov refused to participate in the referendum.
He clarified that he chose the name for the country 27 years ago in a referendum on independence. The Macedonian leader looks negatively on the idea of renaming the country.
"It creates a new semi-sovereign government with a new name," remarked Ivanov.
The agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslavian Republic - the Republic of Northern Macedonia - was signed by the heads of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of Macedonia and Greece on June 17th of this year during a ceremony on the shore of Lake Prespa, through which runs the border between the two countries.
This agreement should decide a disagreement that has lasted for many years over the name of the country, and also mark a step towards NATO and EU membership, reports TASS.

This was reported by the European commission press service on September 30.
To control the aid mission, European commission sent its experts in the region.
It is noted that the money will be spent for disinfection, providing food, water, temporary shelters and medicine.

The US are also ready to help in liquidating the consequences of the disaster, claimed the US Department of State press person Hiser Nauert.
Also, the US diplomatic mission in Indonesia didn’t get any information about the US casualties.
On September 28, two big earthquakes with the magnitudes of 7.2 and 7.4 happened in the Central Sulawesi province.
By the morning of September 30, seismologists detected more then 130 aftershocks.
Due to this, some island’s regions still remain without transport connection, electricity and telecommunication.

The USA is behind the growth of opiate production in Afghanistan
The sharp exacerbation of the situation in Afghanistan on September 26th was much discussed in Iran.
There many conferences took place involving Iran, India, China, Afghanistan, and Russia, which was represented by the Secretary of the Security Council Nikolai Patrushev.
In essence, in the territory of Afghanistan fighters waged a real territorial war against the government authorities and peaceful population of the country.
"This year set a record for the number of bloody terrorist attacks, as a result of which thousands of innocent Afghans have died," remarked Patrushev.
Afghanistan's troubles began long ago.
After the terrorist attacks of September 11, the terrorist group "Al Qaeda" (prohibited in the Russian Federation), entrenched in Afghanistan, was declared to be the USA's chief enemy.
Not a month passed before America and its NATO allies began Operation Enduring Freedom there.
Seventeen years have passed.
Several thousand American troops are currently in Afghanistan territory.
Nevertheless, peaceful life is even more illusory now than before.
American forces have been driven behind the fences of dozens of their bases.
Despite their efforts, militants are paid off merely not to touch them.
The Government of Afghanistan controls a minority of the country's territory - 40%, according to Patrushev.
50% is controlled by the Taliban (prohibited in the Russian Federation).
Another 10% is controlled by ISIL (prohibited in the Russian Federation).
But they are quickly growing.
Their goal is to create a barbarian pseudocaliphate in Central Asia - exactly the one that did not succeed in Iraq and Syria.
By all appearances, America is behind this.
America is also behind the fact that, after 17 years of its presence in the region, the production of narcotics (opiates) in Afghanistan has increased by at least a factor of 40.
The colossal growth in fields sown with opium poppy and multi-billion dollar profits.
Macedonians are preparing to vote in a referendum on joining the EU and NATO, subject to changing the name of the country.
An agreement to rename the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as the Republic of Northern Macedonia was reached on June 17 as a result of long-term negotiations with neighboring Greece, which refused to recognize the right of its northern neighbor to be called Macedonia, perceiving that such a name challenged the same Greek province and Greek history.
Lyupko Petkovsky, political scientist: "Thanks to this agreement, Macedonia or Northern Macedonia is gaining the right to a better future and hope for social change.
And Greece will secure its right to its past.
There are no perfect agreements.
They arise as a result of difficult compromises and they cannot make absolutely everyone happy".
The ruling social democrats, led by the prime minister Zoran Zaev, are in favor of renaming the country.
The conservative opposition and the country's president Gjorge Ivanov are against it.
According to journalist Tsvetin Chilimanov, it does not make sense for Macedonia to join the EU - it is sufficient to have partnership relations with it: “Many people who do not like the agreement believe that the current socialist government headed by Zaev has been imposed from the outside in order to change the name of the country.
But this decision will bring about negative consequences.
First of all, loss of sovereignty.
Clearly there are countries that would not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans".
Fei Dulgeri, Euronews: “The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is facing the biggest challenge in its history.
The country is at a crossroads.
The choice that the citizens of Macedonia will make will determine the future not only of the Balkans, but also of Europe as a whole".
