A person before reading a book needs to think beforehand about what he will get from it.
Long ago our mentor Askar Tokpanov: I have seen you speaking on TV.
Not bad.
Deepen your mind, read Abay, do not get distracted.
He learned all Abay's poems by heart.
I also read songs of praise along with Abay's, Mukagali's poems.
I read again and again.
The things you read will be kept in mind.
When I was young my memory was great, I learned by heart quickly.
Today all of this is my wealth.
In fact, I am a sociable, talkative person.
I feel sorry for those who put on airs.
This is what abundance means!
This month I get 42,700 tenge in my hand.
Nobody hates to get, I was really glad.

It was recovered by "Elevator Agrofood" company as much as they can, now it stores, sells high-quality wheat with an adhesive capacity of 30 turns growing in Torgay district.
China on one side, Arabs on the other side, and Russia nearby express their interest in our Torgay district wheat.
We will soon install German powerful mill grinding 70 tons of flour per day, then we will give job for 10-15 more people.
We think that we will be able to raise the salary more.
Today, 22 people work at the grain elevator.
Among them, we have given 5-6 people earning 32-33 thousand tenge per month a raise.
This is a base wage only.
Work in agriculture is not given by time, sometimes when it is needed to perform additional works extra charge per hour is paid, - executive director of grain elevator Kurman Abdrakhman says.

Gorgeous celebration in all the cities and residential areas of Kazakhstan of the 100th anniversary of bloodthirsty red butchers of Leninist Komsomol is a shame for our country, brothers.
This, first of all, means Komsomols' slap in the face of the Independence of the Kazakh Country.
Yesterday the information about the great celebration of the 100th anniversary of red butchers trying their best by the initiators, heads of former Komsomol, followers initiated by today's red butchers Nurlan Omarov in Semey, the birthplace of "Alashorda" standing at the origins of Kazakh statehood was released.
I was surprised to see pioneers wearing a red tie on the Internet in Kazakhstan schools.
Now having seen these Russified, i.e. slaves with no origin started to poison openly the conscious of Kazakh young generation I found nothing to say... What a horror!
How can we understand this Komsomol's backtrack from the Independence of Kazakh Country, saying we are Russian slaves?
Oh, horror, slave's name is a slave!
We need to understand that recognition by those Tasmagambetov, Aitimova, Sultanov in fact that they are colonizers' slaves, open expression of their endless love towards Russia is an open recognition of the dependence of today's followers of yesterday red butchers first of all to Russia which we thought to be vanished into thin air up to date.
In 1986, I still remember dishonest actions of those current "forever deputies": K.Sultanov, B.Aitimova during famous December events in 1986 dished on D.Konayev who helped them raise in their careers to Gennady Kolbin, grieving and crying, now they told about those participating in December events: "Comrade Kolbin, I will bring those bitches you to punish them", and I was the one to write about this grief in my epos "Zobalan" (Outrages), during the Soviet Empire, in particular, in 1990, made one-hour long radio play in Munich, and I am the author of the famous writing traveling the world, akyn Zhumash Kokbori!
The Kazakh nation also did not forget who involuntarily quietened down at that time!
As the citizen of Independent Kazakhstan, as the child of the Kazakh nation, I will accuse openly the followers of those red butchers!
If our country is independent indeed, I will openly talk that the day born to punish them as the state betrayers constituting a threat openly to the Independence of Kazakhstan of forever president of this country as the whole people!
"My nation, my Kazakh, my poor people" (Abay), it is the moment to openly punish these red butcher Komsomol as the whole nation.
Wake up, Kazakhs, history will never forgive your next quiescency.
Never forget this, Kazakhs!

And asked to transfer 100 percent money for items to Qiwi wallet.

Arkhimed Mukhambetov about changing Kostanay region into Torgay.
Akim of Kostanay region Arkhimed Mambetov expressed his opinion concerning the initiative about naming Kostanay region as Torgay region.
Today the question concerning an open letter about changing the name of the region of the initiative group has been put at the briefing held in Astana.
I have familiarized myself with the letter.
I have seen it.
In general, I am against it.
Because Kostanay region has its own name from history.
If I am not mistaken, 17 people signed this letter.
I know a few people.
When I talked to them in person, Sabyrzhan Akhmetuly who was akim in many districts refused it saying "I have not signed this letter".
Kalibek Deripsaldin (composer) said that he also had not signed this letter.
For this reason, I believe that disturbing people is not correct, - Arkhimed Mukhambetov said.
The regional akim reminded that there is an order of changing the name of the residential area, and hearings must be held.
So, we will see.
But, in general, there is my viewpoint.
We have the center of the district formed with Torgay name, coming from long since.
If in 30s, 40s the name of Kostanay city was Torgay, then the works on returning the previous name would be reasonable.
But I am against it, it is my viewpoint - Arkhimed Mukhambetov concluded.
