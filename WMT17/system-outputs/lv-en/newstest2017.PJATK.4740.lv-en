russia and turkey : izstumto alliance ?
it was a gesture which ended the crisis .
russian and turkish leaders met on tuesday in order to sarokotos lasted eight months and notify the word &quot; war and economic sanctions .
however , vladimir putin ( with turkey &apos;s leaders , and the impression that ankara is that this partnership is needed most .
nevertheless , the two senators .
vladimir putin , the chinese , and was not caused by emotions , even after his to their usual standards .
in contrast , the eta call putin on his &quot; dear friend &quot; , repeating it at least five times , she said .
the number of cents .
but he promised that the relations with russia results not only to pre-crisis levels , but even still .
the next day the newspaper reported that uzvadoties biassed as if nothing bad would have happened .
in his enthusiasm resulted in conflicting feelings .
however , putin izstarojošā peculated showed that russia was not forgotten .
the first , which he mentioned in his address to the russian planes and the syrian border .
the moscow reacted strongly .
putin accused ankara of ponies ieduršanu moscow .
pāridarījums was a candy , given that it came from my friend .
restoring genuine confidence it will be very difficult , perhaps even impossible .
since november , both the russian public &apos;s position has changed .
for several months the government controlled tv , their broad hostility against ankara .
suddenly , it was all to blame the turks .
of gravest charge , which is the same as for the profits of the illegal oil trade with islamic state controlled part of syria .
he himself denied it fully .
the st petersburg was given a signal that it is time to forget the past .
after all , this meeting was held only because putin received apologies from the small screen .
russia could be seen as a kind of victory .
ankara &apos;s benefit from the peace settlement are clear to all .
first of all , we need all the iespejamie friends thereafter , when he was nearly overthrown in last month &apos;s coup attempt .
the numerous terrorist attacks have shaken his positions .
and there is also the economic motives .
russian sanctions have led to substantial losses , and , in particular , the ban on charter , which normally provides the turkish beach with several million russian tourists each year .
this figure fell by almost 90 % .
the russian and barrier-breaking čarterkompānijas confronts when scheduled flights will be resumed .
they expect to be seasonal and leave the mediterranean .
the national tv provides the fruit and vegetable prices , when will be renewed turkish fruit and vegetable imports .
as quoted from the local newspaper last : &quot; respect for them , all of us &quot; .
the visit also had other political motives in moscow .
ankara is angry at the west for , in their view , the weak response to the coup attempt .
we all may be alphabetized also prolonged the negotiations on accession to the eu , and putin &apos;s interference , who gladly used the situation that turkey and western relations are atvēsinājušās .
&quot; that certainly was a winner , providing support to ankara and its authorities following the attempted coup .
please note that i fear for regime change in the country .
the summit , which took place in this gleznajā maritime , he gave russia and turkey , and , as with the others , &quot; izstumto alliance &apos; , two countries which feel excluded from the west , by combining forces .
however , despite the public demonstration of unity between the two countries , there are significant differences .
one of those is syria , where russia presents itself as the peace by the media , but where russia and turkey supports the other side .
after more than three hours long discussions both presidents press conference revealed that they have not even touched on this issue .
turkish president purposefully avoided questions on the two countries &apos; differences , president putin has mentioned its only separately .
there is no real clear how both countries could find common ground on syria .
however , after several months of open hostility and a potential disaster , when a member of nato , turkey is a russian combat aircraft , the situation has improved , because both leaders have re-launched the talk .
royal bank of scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of scotland
my skb offisa future role , declared the bank &apos;s executive director .
outside of scotland skb will no longer be available .
ross said the united states &quot; channel in scotland that skb brand were the banks with global ambitions .
it has abandoned them , because prior to eight years the bank almost went bankrupt and it was necessary financiāla assistance .
in the meantime , brand stratēģisti have used skb brands in order to protect other consumer financial brands .
the bank received millions of pounds from international sports representatives , starting with the six nations ( oxy.n ) and ending with &quot; what is the mureju .
however , it has now been decided to give an opportunity to other nacionalajiem brands to gain popularity .
scottish royal banaka will be available to scottish customers , but will not be made public .
in england and wales , will be key in future skb cheerfulness and stock market way , but worries the other parts of the name will be changed to natwest .
the bank has already being used in the republic of ireland and in northern ireland .
now they will also benefit smaller private financial brands , such as coutts , adam &amp; amp ; co , drummond , and be &apos; s military bank .
united were caving in singapore with customers and employees by invernesšīru .
he told bbc scotland : &quot; skb channel will become our investors , and it will receive greater attention , because we have now become more about brand banking &quot; .
this time , the bank itself became a global brand and skb also became a global brand .
now , i say that we no longer have a global ambition , we need local ambitions .
each of these brands will be represented by something unique , each in its sector and our staff will work with clients under these brands .
skb has already announced that it will not &quot; psalm &quot; sponsorship and invite people from other brands to participate in co-sponsors .
&quot; it is the right time to become a banking because the banks within the eu we already have long asked ourselves the question of how to become a better banking clients ? &apos; &quot; executive director .
this is a very cynical , if , before three years ago we would have said that was an excellent bank for our customers and develop these brands .
however , thanks to the work and to the customer , rather than our own needs , we have made changes .
we can once again to revive these brands , which is why i think that now is the right time .

they are &quot; olympic piecinieks &apos; , because next year &apos;s olympic gymnastic team consist of only four athletes and this is the last year of the trucks were at work .
the truth is that &apos;s is an expensive sport and , above all , to subsidise a private , clubs and maintain them , parents who pay for the premises , travel , hotels , evolves ( coaches , athletes and their families ) and other expenses .
most of these clubs was located in urban areas , which can afford such a sport .
these clubs , with all their own , and it is costly and a contribution to the families .

liberal develops force , full life cycle and body coordination , as well as the hard work , discipline and commitment to the objectives .
this combination provides for a long life of good health and success , both at school and at work .
this team will inspire thousands of young girls , &quot; and it is fantastic .

this is so exciting . &quot;

the ways of the child to help cope with anger .
i am often confronted with the fact that the child &apos;s anger , the emergence of the parents considered something perverse and abnormal .
when a child openly showing their anger - we do not know how to react , &quot; wings &quot; washington &quot; .
jindal urges on a small negotiation on these so natural and human feelings - anger , and mercifully , which periodically going through each .
aggression - it is already a natural activity , addressed against other human beings , and it usually appears when the feel angry .
when we , as adults , we are angry , upset - usually know , is happening to us , and how to handle him .
we are their anger and niknumus they can : to express , to oppress , to conceal , to keep ourselves , tell us about it with their friends or other relatives , we can , in the end , a cigarette ( this is not the best way to anger unpixelated ! ) , , , , , , , , , and do the other things that usually do .
we are its aggression against other lookout , because we know that various other ways to cope with these emotions .
children , when anger from them , do not understand what is happening with them , as its name , and how to live with them .
they can say : &quot; go away ! &quot; , you &apos;re a fool , &quot; and &quot; bad &quot; &quot; , kohlschreiber said &quot; &quot; , i am with you nedraudzēšos &apos; - and very rarely , when able to say : &apos; i will fight for you &quot; .
children live in brampton , meaning they are fully located directly here , at this moment in time , they are spontaneous and genuinely feel their stamford bridge ground and , frequently , also located in various emotions .
it is very important that parents feel the child from the show , including anger , nekauninātu on it and nerātos , but precisely the opposite - to help the child .
are relations need picked ?
every day at work , which is not quite the same , whereas , as you would like , or simply a bad mood - there are so many reasons why i would like to briefly , days or even longer &quot; in &quot; from all over the world .
is it possible for a four-man also relations and breathe a little .
is it also but it shows that each of the partners romaine ?
the views and gentlemen at different ages .
janis ( 23 ) is short and succinct : &quot; in my view , if relations need a cheesecake , then marched together with real people &quot; .
the &apos; ( 30 ) is a scheme which , perhaps someone can help .
if the partner you are beginning to break each of the smallest detail , then certainly - this is the time when it should be examined other hunting the countryside , in order to understand , or was she lacking , or , in particular , for their &quot; or even in general , their no longer see .
so the answer is - yes , the withholding of the hilt can help to save time and to understand how important it is and isolated .
&quot; ( 29 ) reveal their theory .
in my opinion , the relationship is the cheesecake from each other daily , because if this time with people 24 hours a day , seven days a week , then the controversy is inevitable .
they are caused by the fact that a team-best every detail , what the other is doing , and it is starting to break .
people are the smart one another , particularly if not even longer on what was , not on what was done by the day .
my personal experience is , therefore , also i am not a relationship for longer than a few months ago .
if you do , think about the fact that elsewhere , or the other is better - why is this woman with which , together , deserves such , which may reflect on the fact that it is not sufficiently well and in the corner of the countryside ?
thinking alone is already a small betrayal .
if not , then not .
&quot; i have , therefore , condemn those who are not &quot; in &quot; ( 46 ) .
&quot; ( 33 ) is almost completely the opposite view .
it seems to me that we all need in a lifetime .
but every moment , all the time , from morning till night , look each other in the eye and the corn .
attopies .
there is so much the case - friends , work , &quot; he said .
everything has its own time .
of course the friend or wife , however , if both can keep their līdzsvariņu between family life and the rest of the world , then it can live up to the grave .
that , and only that .
&quot; ( 27 ) , it said : &quot; it is difficult to say - need or not , may or may not take into account the pause , but one thing is clear - its something ian wood relations until the end , no , something is missing . &quot;
if this is an issue is that , in the near future will be about change - the good or the bad side , it depend on ourselves .
i think that , whilst a further new and crazy , &quot; picked &quot; - something all the time , but when everything remains serious and relations to enter another phase , then the rest is out of the question .
you have but to spend all their lives together !
&quot; if now cannot withstand another society and from time to time , need a respite , then which will , when you will be pensioners , who , as a russian , or argue about which day was the better &apos; &quot; , ( 19 ) .

the researchers discuss &quot; the number of victims of the fall of the berlin wall &quot; .
according to a new study , the number of fatalities on the communist yoke , the former east german border could be much greater than previously thought , but doubts about the true number of victims still have not been addressed .
according to the data , which was disclosed to the fall of the berlin wall , he read out the verdicts , during the period from 1945 to 1989 at the border with western allied zones and the subsequent pumpkins communist authorities noslepkavojušas 1841 people who tried to escape from their controlled territory .
but with the border related deaths is studying for years and every time to adjust the number of victims .
the list attached another 11 deaths , including between the victims , including a six years old boy who drowned , family trying to get through to the czechoslovakia and hungary .
the new victims of the fall of the berlin wall is also the soviet army .
&quot; the final amount of the damage caused by a communist and socialist evil , not yet fully documented &quot; , said jon sopel , hildebrante .
&quot; our task is to ensure that those graves who died trying to escape from the communist controlled country , would be the zarzuela and ricard &quot; , highlights the hildebrantes ? , ? ? ? c .
however , other researchers questioned the new figures already .
&quot; the figure 1841 is untenable &quot; , the süddeutsche zeitung , argues the berlin free university of east german history expert Štāts disorders .
he , together with other researchers from the free university of berlin is currently reviewing the possible suspicious deaths at the border , and so far they have managed to confirm only 260 cases .
the researchers estimated that only to the fall of the berlin wall the communists to 138 people .
taking into account those people who died trying to escape to the baltic sea , or to the west via neighbouring countries territory , following Štāta view , the number of victims could be achieved around a thousand .
however , it is still considerably less than 1841 .
one of the reasons for the differences in the number of victims could be different methodologies .
he read out the verdicts , and also to all the east german border guards in cases of suicide , regardless of whether they were directly linked to their service .
it also lists the deaths , which are not related to direct violence .
&quot; if at the age of 70 to 80 years after a lot of border control , died from heart attack &apos; , it should be these &apos; slepkavnieciskās borders &quot; consequences , considers hildebrante .
however Štāts is convinced that draw the distinction between old people who , perhaps as a result of the deaths of their treatment , and those whose death caused prendrait &quot; at the border .
irrespective of the victims &apos; accounts is not easy , because of the communist east german authorities did not accumulate such statistical data , and researchers jāizvētī documents proved different archives , notes Štāts .
however , Štāta group recently , the new documents , and therefore , in the near future , it could come up with a new estimate of the number of victims .

spain &apos;s deficit reduction opportunities undermined by failure to form a government .
a month ago , on 12 july , the european commission ( ec ) presented its opinion that spain and portugal have not implemented sufficiently in measures to reduce the budget deficit to the level of the euro with the required 3 % of gross domestic product ( gdp ) .
calculations show that in spite of the austerity measures taken by the portuguese budget deficit at the end of last year was 4.4 % of gdp , but in spain - 5.1 % .
the european commission , however , decided not to apply to both countries , economic sanctions , while , at the same time , both in setting fiscal targets to the nearest time .
one of the reasons why the ec but not enforcing sanctions against the two countries is growing euroscepticism in many countries of the european union .
additional sanctions such negative sentiment is only increasing .
critics argue that the ec is not consistent in its decisions , from the beginning by agreeing on common rules and then failing to apply them in real life .
for example , the german president of beverley jens veidmanns pointed out that europe is losing credibility among themselves , creating the impression that the european union &apos;s rules are permissive and not binding .
the ec has proposed and approved by all the member states to extend the deadline for a budget deficit by the end of the year , in 2018 , portugal and spain .
the european commission , in the coming months to examine the progress made in both countries , while , at the same time indicating that both spain and portugal , both must be prepared to introduce further austerity measures , if the circumstances so require .
initial forecasts suggest that portugal may be able to achieve the target set at the time , and already this year , the budget deficit could be reduced to 2.5 % of gross domestic product .
this means that the stability programme , the government of this country must implement austerity measures amounting to 0.25 % of gdp .
these measures should be included in this year &apos;s budget , the additional attention to goods and services and procurement cost control .
in the case of spain the situation is much more complex .
the deficit must be reduced to 4.6 % next year , 3.1 % in 2018 and 2.2 % of gdp .
in addition , over the next two years of consolidation measures every year to be 0.5 % of gdp .
particularly difficult to achieving these goals makes the fact that eight months after the spanish political parties failed to agree on the formation of a government , and increasingly becomes the possibility that spain may be the third time during the year to hold early parliamentary elections .
however , public opinion polls indicate that the third election the political picture in the country substantially unchanged .
the party is still the current prime minister mariano &quot; the people &apos;s party , which won the elections once again gain over 33 % of the votes .
it &apos;s a bit piqued only socialists , while against austerity measures , according to the parties &apos; or &apos; together we can &apos; and &apos; fashion &apos; or &apos; citizens &apos; popularity is somewhat diminished .
the people &apos;s party wants to achieve a socialist and &apos; irreversible &apos; involvement in government yet this month , otherwise it will not succeed in mid-october to adopt and submit for approval by the european commission on the 2017 draft budget .
as the group of the european people &apos;s party &apos;s parliamentary representative , hernando , if the government fails to establish and parliamentary elections will be held , but also for the third time , spain will become a laughing stock all over europe .
pludmaļu cleanliness in the gulf of riga was is critical .
fifth year surveying beaches , activists concluded that , unfortunately , is increasing every year , the number of waste , and here are largely to blame for bathing . &quot;

it was that bathing every day of it , but the fight against netīrīgajiem visitors is quite difficult .
in addition , the waste water during heavy rainfall may be ieskaloti , thus it is a male quality .
apart from the beach and some sites , beaches and elsewhere in latvia is critical .
such a statement this week , the campaigns &apos; the sea &apos; volunteers .
the fifth year in the road along the gulf of riga , activists concluded that the population and number of waste to one hundred metres has risen .
unfortunately , this year it kritiskuma assessment has argued .
&quot; we can see that this will be the year in which the number of waste , at 100 metres , perhaps even may exceed 200 units &quot; , said , &quot; the sea &quot; , he says .

the organiser of the participant and non-family in pollution responsible for directly citizens .
&quot; the main source is the same day of the season , because more than half of the total number of waste is plastic , various waste , starting with the plastic bags , which are already at the stage of degradation , it is no longer possible for them to identify , and photography , bottles bercer &apos; .
the headset is also the bathing beaches . &quot;
for example , the average of every one hundred metres of waste collected nearly 800 units , which is critical of the many .
campaign organisers , &quot; that at around the same time and not everywhere ( papaver rhoeas also functioned as a warning or a ban .
&quot; the average figures on all three , bathing together - clifford , kerobokan jail and uninformed - unfortunately , a large and far exceeds the desired objective , to which it is moving to latvia , to reduce waste and the number of units to 135 units &quot; , concludes environmental defender .
bathing cleansing the poker every day , as lawyers seek deportation even twice , &quot; she said .
however , the fight with netīrīgajiem visitors is quite difficult .

that is why he calls for bathing , to report on the polluters and the police .
he called the police , and to point out these violations and , in a way , all the fight .
we can impose what new warnings , but , as i said , it &apos;s hardly as will radically change the situation .
&quot; since all together simply to address and be firm against such offenders &quot; , he stresses .
the water quality measurements taken this summer for the fourth time , lulzsec , which may impose a ban on the official site .
in both , as well as in other years , the quality of water everywhere , a good and satisfactory .
the reality is that all 56 bathing water quality all the time has been good and there are no restrictions on bathing .
&quot; the last time we collect the analysis at the end of august &quot; , inspections &quot; environmental health issues fortin said .
strong during heavy rainfall on land and the waste can be ieskaloti water .
this in turn may affect the quality of the environment .

&quot; in order to achieve the desired weight reduction results , very important is the right combination of food choices &quot; , said lithuanian romeraite-kuklieriene superhero &quot; .
in addition , it is easy to be done during the summer period , when our own gardens grow fresh fruits , berries and vegetables .
pdt , a combination of dietary products may help not only to reduce obesity , but also determined to promote different body processes .
macaroni and vinegar is a successful combination , because providing lasting first smart-trainer , and helps to combat the fat .
research , published in the journal clinical nutrition , proved that vinegar has a beneficial effect on blood glucose levels and helps us feel mundriem .
so ? and protein rich food such as meat , poultry , or protein , causing not only of weight loss , but also reduce the car &apos;s large meals at the next hearing .
such a combination capable of increasing the quantity of wembley after meals up to 35 % .
studies show that , on the publication of ? ? may help to get rid of abdominal fat .
he is composed , a nutrient - &quot; , while macdonald is a good source of vitamin c ) .
accepting a sufficient amount of these nutrients , may reduce the ? , ? ? ? level , hence the accumulation of fat in the body .
but nobody is talking about is what it is , which is connected to the fresh berries , is another , and the fat years for the breakfast , which is worth to her .
kristaps and berries contain fibre , which , in accordance with the conclusions of the canadian scientists control grelīnu - appetite stimulating hormone - and thus also the feeling hungry for more .
in addition , berries contain ? incident , which is reducing the weight of the assistants , as well as prevents the fat .
vegetables , protein , and also be able to work miracles in reducing weight .
this combination can lead to cop .
vegetables contain water and fibre , and therefore contributes to the cop .
at the same time , the protein slows down the digestive process and provides for a longer period .
&quot; we can eat chicken with lettuce , or a protein , from the finished mixture and enjoy it with their favourite vegetables .
the combinations of the products to avoid .
it is sugars ( monosaccharides or disaccharides - one or two molecules compounds .
in contrast , starch , which is located in vegetables is idyll .
fruit is mechanically and chemically decompose they does not biodegrade by a third or fourth degree digestive process , is happening .
starches decomposes at three different stages , which begins in the mouth .
it is therefore essential to someone immediately after meals .

the recycling requires different digestive juices , each with a different strength , features and time that must be cooked .
panther , medusmelone , muskatmelone and other melons always eat separately from the other .
melones is not shaming , if they are cooked together with other food products .
fats in combination with protein rich foods .
fats constitute a successful combination of starch , but the same cannot be said for the fat and protein - fat , protein prevents carpets inside
protein can be combined with a very small amount of fat .
if they consume large quantities of products containing proteins , apologies from fat consumption altogether .
this also applies to the faculty-focused - not advisable to combine large quantities of nuts ( containing protein ) with a whole etiquette ( containing fats ) .
such a combination of hampers effective weight reduction .

egg and meat processing thermal withdrawing the existing protein natural characteristics , making them easier to barber .
the meat and egg thermal processing makes this product contains existing iron and other minerals absorbējamas easier . &quot;
it should also be borne in mind that freezing products can reduce the amount of vitamin c from 10 % to 90 % , but does not affect any of the fibre parole .
dunk in combination with tomatoes may increase iron reception &quot; , which , in turn , provides a better brain and muscle activity .
our will receive 33 % less ne-asinsradošās iron , which can be found in plant foods such as beans , &quot; eastman , cereal products , than asinsradošās iron , which found the animal products in a country such as beef , fish and a martini .

portland kausētavas future becomes uncertain , when is terminated ambitious treaty .
aluminium kausētavas and hundreds of its staff , the future of mahmoud abbas has become blurred , when the energy company , which was its main commentator announced the suspension of cooperation .
this announcement follows the government &apos;s plans to stop subsidising the energy companies , which is vital in order to enable it to continue to work .
20 years of subsidies will be discontinued in november .
consequently , more than 2000 alkoas portland factory jobs are now at risk .
there could be up to 2000 both direct and indirect jobs .
in addition , it should also be unpredictable effects , because kausētava consumes around 10 per cent of all the electricity .
in 2014 , alcoa shut the point henry smelter , which led to the angleseas plants operational disruption .
alkoas kausētava portland working with losses and could be closed .
these events followed by several years of speculation on the rise in the value of the australian dollar and factory production costs .
the energy supplier agl , which supplied its own energy from the loy yang a power stations latroubes ielejā , says that most likely the other three owners stop their contracts .
most power plants owned by two companies - ucla and alumia , in addition to companies , there &apos;s also the chinese wired compound , and japan &apos;s marubeni to everyone . &quot;
&quot; agl looks forward to a continuation of the factory activity , which would mean further energy supply kausētavai &quot; , said its representative .
agl said that contracts are the so-called &quot; medium risk &quot; restrictive &quot; , which is intended to enter into force from november 2016 .
treaties have 12 months of validity , therefore they will be in force until 2017 .
&quot; agl expects these medium incomes will continue to bear in the 2017 fiscal year &quot; , said a representative .
from fg18 potential income risks are limited with the wholesale energy market for future prices .
agl claims that their forecasts are already too optimistic losses amounting to usd 187 million , providing that these contracts will be terminated .
alcoa said that the decision to terminate the contracts will not affect alcoa kausētavas opportunities to continue activities or to supply the energy .
it is said that in 2010 it signed a contract with loy yang for 20 years , but in november it will be terminated . &quot; has not provided explanations as to why it &apos;s cooperation .
analysts have expressed concern about both the possible closure of the portland kausētavas misappropriation , both tomago factory closure near Ņūkāstlas , owing to the adverse situation in this industry .
agl executive director steven scrap last week said that , after analysts estimates , kimoko ikegami during the year spent 600 first-in-class and tomago 900 first-in-class energy .
if both of these plants from the energy market , this means a considerable reduction in energy demand .
and it would not be good .
komūnas legal centre , rejects every year 160 000 people .

three of the five people in queensland - mainly pensioners , immigrants , vulnerable workers , victims of violence , and those who do not have the resources to combat the illegal eviction , are refused free legal assistance and representation .

common legal , director of the centre for the ceo said that the latest national legal centre asociācicijas report said that , at the moment , being refused legal aid for thousands of people who need it .
mistrs ceo pointed out , if this decision is not reversed , then the situation will become only worse .
he also says : &apos; mkae a legal centre constantly provided with inadequate funding , which means that aid is refused the thousands of people who need it . &quot;
people , which seeks to put an end to the violent relationship , people with deep debts , families , which is undergoing a divorce , the workers who are unfairly dismissed - all these people is the natural legal challenges and this report shows that they do not receive the necessary assistance .
in june 2017 , the federal government will reduce funding by 30 per cent , which means that even several thousand mkae the population will need to be addressed in their complex legal problems without assistance .
we are calling on attorney general and mkae george brandisu immediately suspend funding reductions , so that people who need legal aid , it could obtain .
last year , the government revealed its plans to raise the level of legal assistance to the national average .
now is the time to draw attention to the local communes and their clients &apos; needs and palazčuka government invest in this important field .

britain must maintain olympic spirit and expand heathrow .
heathrow not only contribute to prosperity and growth in local regions , and in london , but also throughout the country .
this is , in my opinion , and yes very attractive , just as happened in london in 2012 , where we have huge effort from the olympic games would benefit all regions of the country .
stratforda and Īstenda , extremely far from the olympic games .
and we will do it again , providing the local population , and companies with business opportunities , near heathrow .
local but unless we create 10 000 new business opportunities , 40 000 new jobs and finally put the youth unemployment in the vicinity of heathrow .
but as was the case in the london olympic games in 2012 , will be people who will consider that this challenge is too great , and that the expansion of heathrow is too ambitious .
he said that britain would never fail to prepare for the olympic games , and that it will be a global failure .
it was wrong for the year 2012 , and in the case of the heathrow they will not be true .
there are always obstacles to be overcome , but heathrow has so far has overcome everything .
like the olympics , heathrow is an infrastructure project that will be to the benefit of society as a whole , rather than individually , individuals .
enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs , economic growth , eur 211 billion , creating soil both employment experience , both in the airport and throughout britain .
heathrow , we have an excellent team , which has created a 11 billion pounds worth of infrastructure investment programme , which fits within the time period and the budget , starting with terminal 5 , which for a period of five years from the ground has been named the best airport terminal in the world , and finally with terminal 2 , which is between two more intensively used , humiliated in the world .
now they are ready to establish a third runway , which will be funded by private investment of 16 billion pounds .
2012 london olympic games has been a great success , and i am convinced that the same will be true of the heathrow expansion .
the time has come for us to revive the olympic spirit and to extend heathrow , ensuring our trading future and creating a new environment with employment , with which britain can be proud of .

the body has a saidjaševs which neighbour started it , and since then the canyon from the ceilings , and there is no assurance that reside in the apartment are safe .

then i inform you i &apos;ve had with managers , and other organisations .
i said that we have no operational service and we do not have any expert .

now it remains to seek other places to live - shared , hotel , or rent another flat .
but the losses incurred , may seek to recover from the neighbour , which sees him as both can take a very long time .
arbitrary due to construction on both reside in the apartments is now prohibited , and to give its judgement , and it may have to wait up to three weeks .

nasa climate model : the ever been inhabitable planet
based on nasa &apos;s latest climate models , the ever has been inhabitable planet .
nasa &apos;s goddard institute for space studies scientists have developed a model , in order to examine our history , using tools and algorithms , which are also used for climate scientists .
the model was developed in order to determine whether the surface of venus , which is hot , not on its water and its atmosphere consisting almost exclusively of carbon , has ever been in similar circumstances .
scientists have previously expressed speculate that venus is attributable to the slow speed in the atmosphere .
but the latest simulation shows that on venus once had the plan , a similar atmosphere and a charge of slowly .
the model also deals with our earlier topography .
the planet has been more dry areas than on earth , but on its been sufficient water and geographical diversity , in order to be able to shape lives and prevent the water evaporate .
early times our sun was on 30 per cent then .
giss model our own squeals model reveals that part of the day because of its lasting 2 months , explained in a press release , &quot; del genio giss .
this process is a planet surface and causes , which in turn creates a strata , which acts as an umbrella , protecting the planet from solar heat .
as a result , the moderate climate temperature , which is , in fact , a few degrees lower than the temperature of the earth today .
the model in our history , which is similar to the evolution theory , which have drawn up their own hipotēzēs scientists .
