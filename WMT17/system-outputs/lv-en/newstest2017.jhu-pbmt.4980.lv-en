the new doctors &apos; strike : calls for new protests
new doctors &apos; representatives demanding their trade unions to launch protests in a dispute over a new contract .
the british medical association ( lma ) new physicians committee ( jak ) is going to require council to support the wider protests at the beginning of september .
jak believes that ministers have failed to dispel doubts about the contract .
in july , the young doctors and medical students rejected the contract offered by the lma .
voted against the contract , 58 % of all members who took part in the vote .
on thursday evening in a message on twitter , a member of the board of jak elēna makkorta points out that the government continues to remain silent on this issue and therefore the contract offer is rejected .

russia and turkey : excluded the alliance ?
gesture , which has put an end to the crisis .
the russian and turkish leaders met on tuesday to announce sarokotos and lasted for eight months on the floor and economic sanctions by the end of the war .
however , vladimir putin sasveicinoties with turkish leaders in st. petersburg palace , had the impression that this partnership more need for ankara .
however , both sarokojās .
vladimir putin &apos;s smile looked samākslots and did not cause warm emotions , even taking into account his usual reticence .
in contrast , recep erdoğan tajjips at least five times has described putin as a &quot; dear friend , &quot; according to tuesday &apos;s meeting .
i nojuka number .
he also pledged that relations with russia will not only up to the level before the crisis , but will become even stronger .
the next day , a newspaper reported that erdoğan behaved as if nothing had happened .
in my opinion , his enthusiasm leads to conflicting feelings .
but from putin starojošais vēsums shows that the russian leader has not forgotten anything .
the first thing he mentioned in his speech , was the downing of the russian plane on the syrian border .
at the time , moscow has reacted strongly .
putin has accused ankara that it would iedūrusi moscow wearing .
injuries was even more painful , given that it came from a friend &apos;s hand .
to restore genuine confidence is going to be very difficult , maybe even impossible .
since november , the russian public stance has changed .
for several months the government controlled television spread aggressive accusations against ankara .
suddenly , it seemed that everything was guilty of the turks .
it was the most serious accusations that erdoğan &apos;s own family made profits from illegal oil trade with islamic state controlled parts of syria .
he himself is , of course , denied .
however , the st petersburg meeting the main message that it &apos;s time to forget the past .
after all , this meeting took place only because putin president erdoğan received an apology .
russia it could be seen as a kind of victory .
ankara benefits from the peace settlement is obvious .
firstly , erdoganam need all possible friends after the failed coup last month , in which he tried to overthrow .
the numerous terrorist attacks have shaken his positions .
it is also economic motives . &quot;
russian sanctions have caused substantial losses , especially in the charter ban , which normally provides each year , several million russian tourists influx of turkish resorts .
the number of tourists dropped by almost 90 % .
the russian tūroperatori and čarterkompānijas relaxed will breathe easy when scheduled flights will be resumed .
they are hoping to leave fever in the mediterranean end of the season .
already this week , state tv says the fruit and vegetable prices fall , because it will be renewed turkish fruit and vegetable imports .
as the quotes from the local newspaper vedemosti : &quot; tourists them , tomatoes for us . &quot;
but the visit also had other political motives from moscow .
ankara is angry at the west for , in their view , the weak response to the attempted coup .
on the whole , can also pieskatīt dissatisfaction with protracted negotiations for accession to the eu and putin &apos;s intervention , who are willing to use the situation that turkey moved completely away from the west .
the russian leader will undoubtedly won papildpunktus ankara &apos;s eyes , expressing support for the elected government after the attempted coup .
please note that moscow is well understood , in itself is a deeply rooted fear of regime change in the country .
the summit , which was held in the greznajā seaside castle , gave russia and turkey the opportunity to present , as one analyst described it , &quot; marginalized &quot; alliance , the two countries who feel excluded from the west , are joining forces .
but despite the publicly displayed by some unity between the two countries there are still significant differences of opinion .
the main disagreement is syria , where russia is presenting itself as a medium for peace , but in fact , russia and turkey supports the other side .
after more than three hours past the initial talks , if you don &apos;t want to disclose the information , the two presidents at a press conference , announced that they have not discussed the issue .
the turkish president purposefully avoided questions about the differences between the two countries , while president putin wanted to highlight them .
there is no clear consensus as to how the two countries could find common ground on the issue of syria .
but after months of openly hostile relations and potential disaster , when nato member turkey have been downed by russian warplanes , the situation has improved , as the two leaders at least has relaunched the negotiations .
royal bank of scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of scotland
skb brand will continue to be supportive role , said the bank &apos;s ceo .
outside the scottish skb will no longer be available .
ross makevans told the bbc channel in scotland , the skb brand was its association with the bank &apos;s ambitions on the global stage .
it has abandoned those ambitions , because eight years ago the bank almost went bankrupt , and it was in need of financial assistance .
bradshaw zīmolvedības strategy experts have used the skb brand , in order to protect other consumer financial brands .
the bank has received millions of pounds from the international sports sponsors , starting with the six nations rugby and ending with the wimbledon title tennis champion andy mureju .
but now it has been decided to put at the forefront of other national brands .
the scottish royal banaka will be available to scottish customers , but it will not be inicializēta .
in england and wales all skb references , outside the main office and the official stock exchange list , will be replaced on the name from natwest .
the republic of ireland and northern ireland are already being used in the brand the ulster bank .
now attention will also smaller private financial brands , such as coutts and adam &amp; co , drummond , and holt &apos;s military bank .
makevans was intervēts izbrauciena time with customers and employees via invernesšīru .
he told bbc scotland channel : &quot; skb will become our investors &apos; brand and the work of our staff , because now we are becoming more than a brand of banking . &quot;
by the time the bank itself became a global brand and skb became a global brand .
now i say that we no longer have a global ambition , we have local ambitions .
each of these brands will represent something unique in our industry and our staff will work with customers under these brands .
skb has already announced that he will not &quot; six nations &quot; sponsorship and involve various brands of sports co-sponsors .
&quot; it is the right time to become a brand of banking , because we have long been themselves have been asking the question , how to become a better bank for our customers ? &quot; says ceo .
three years ago , it would have been very cynical , if we announce that we become a great bank for our customers and will develop those brands .
but thanks to the hard work and focus on customer needs , rather than our own needs , we obviously have made a big difference .
once again we can revive these brands , so i think that now is the right time .

russian president putin dismissed the administration leader sergey has
russian president vladimir putin unexpectedly dissolved the administration leader sergey has .
ivanov has for many years been putin &apos;s closest circle of people .
now 63 years old politician has been appointed as special representative of the natural and transport issues .
the kremlin statement said that putin &quot; has decided to release from the head of the russian presidential administration job responsibilities , &quot; without giving any reason .
ivanova was appointed to office instead of blaming antons , who was his deputy since 2012 .
the 44 year old blame is izbijis diplomat .
blame was born in 1972 the estonian capital , tallinn , graduated from the prestigious moscow state institute of international relations ( mvsai ) and later worked at the tokyo embassy .
according to the kremlin &apos;s website ( in russian ) , later he led the presidential protocol and government employees in the administration .
putin after the appointment , he said : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
in my opinion , the administration &apos;s main job is to support your work as president of the country , drawing up laws and controlling your decisions are carried out .
putin on friday told a russian broadcaster off air that ivanov himself wanted to leave the office and recommended blamed as a substitute .
or smiles convinces ?
this step moscow embarrassed about that . &quot;
sergei ivanov is an old and close ally of vladimir putin and , like putin , who worked for the soviet kgb security service .
in this capacity , he was one of the most influential men in russia .
country in a televised meeting , the two men announced that ivanov resigns on his own initiative .
but despite a series of chambers talked , rarely with such an explanation convincing , especially ahead of parliamentary elections .
whether it is the result , linked to the struggle for power ?
no one knows .
however , the official statement that the man , who was considered a possible president himself suddenly wanted to become the head of russia &apos;s environmental policy , is regarded with great scepticism .
the kremlin website published remarks ivanov told putin : &quot; it is a fact that at the beginning of 2012 , i ask you to me to entrust this difficult job , one might even say , problematic post for four years .
it turns out that i have been working in office for four years and eight months .
ivanov took office in december 2011 .
previously , he served as prime minister and defence minister .
he is a member of the russian security council and a former kgb employee of the national security service , as well as putin .
at the end of the 1990s , putin headed the federal security service , a successor to the kgb , ivanov served as his deputy post .
when putin came to power , he has called the five people among whom he trusted most .
at the end of putin &apos;s second term ivanov was considered a potential presidential candidate in russia , as putin &apos;s re-election to a third term would be unconstitutional .
but at the time of the president became another close ally of putin , dmitry medvedev .
putin became prime minister , and after three and a half years ago returned to the presidential office .

why do we need a simona , gabija and laurija ?
i call it the steps of the women &apos;s olympic team for a number of reasons .
first of all , i have been to all the summer olympic games since 1984 , and the us team has never been so good .
secondly , this team has three vieglatlētes , simona bailsa , gabija duglasa and laurija hernandeza , which inspires many young girls home .
people can be proud that this team is also alija raismane , who is jewish and medisona kociana , who is a catholic .
finally , this team really represent america .
it has also strengthened the black and latin american athletes &apos; participation in this sport .
over the last four years the best vingrotāja has followed african origin .
last year , simona and gabija ranked 1st and 2nd place .
these are impressive results .
previous olympic games gabija duglasa surprisingly , became an olympic champion , and america could have been līksmot .
now the world has seen neticamus vingrojumus , which complied with the triple world champion simona bailsa , duglasa and laurija hernandeza , through an unprecedented , but meistarīgus vingrojumus .
simona on thursday became the fourth consecutive american , who has won the gold medal individual daudzcīņā women .
she biedrene alija raismane team won the silver medal .
we have seen the best of what this sport can bring , but the rest of the country , the situation gymnastic classes are completely different .
simona , gabija and laurija entered in the olympic team as alija and medisona .
they piecinieks &quot; olympic , &quot; because the next olympic gymnastic team will have only four athletes , and this is the last year of the treneres martas karolas treneres work .
in fact exercise is an expensive sport . vingrotāji vieglatlētikas trenējas mainly private clubs , and their parents , who pays for training , accommodation , travel , formastērpiem , hotels ( coaches , athletes and their families ) and other expenses .
most of these vieglatlētikas clubs are located in urban areas , which can afford this sport .
these clubs athletes discharged all their exercises , and it is a costly and long contribution to the families of the steps .
eimija būrmana - rights bailsas time and maggie hainija - laurijas hernandezas trenējušas time is their female since the two girls began to vieglatlētiku .
we must ensure that young girls who inspires simona , gabija and laurija , cheaper gymnastic training opportunities .
i vieglatlētikas founded their own organisation 20 years ago .
i organizācijaatrodas hārlemā , and we are offering more than 15,000 young people in the city ( mostly black and hispanic origin ) gymnastic exercises for free or at low cost . &quot; we have who were trained to national and international champions .
in september , we will discover a branch in detroit ( in my home town ) , to ensure that the local young people the opportunity to get to know this great sport .
vieglatlētika develops strength , lokanumu and body coordination , also teaches hard work , discipline and commitment to the goal .
this combination provides a long life with good health and success , both at school and at work .
this team will inspire thousands of young girls train with athletics and it is fantastic .
to deal with this type of sport is very important , especially for young girls .
this is a very exciting time .
thank you simona , alija , gabija and medisona on the excellent &quot; the force &quot; demonstrations , winning the olympic gold medals and motivating countless young girls of diverse backgrounds to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
after rejecting the offer džeremija hanta , young doctors are planning to deploy more strikes .
ministers had hoped to end the dispute by reaching an agreement on changes to the treaty with representatives of the british medical association . &quot; but it was rejected by 58 per cent of the 37,000 new doctor who took part in the vote .
in july , hants announced plans to enter into a contract , pointing out that the nhs is in a precarious condition and any further delay will only harm workers and patients .
the first new doctors have already signed up to a new treaty , which requires changes in the conditions of work the night shift and weekends to improve working conditions for irregular working hours .
yesterday evening , the bma &apos;s new doctor dr. elēna makourta announced that young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract , particularly that it will deepen the crisis of the labour force and it does not provide a level playing field for all doctors .
there are eight weeks until the first of the new group of doctors will sign a new contract , so to make progress , because time is running out .
bma attempts to resolve the problem through negotiations have been confronted with the government &apos;s unwillingness to engage in , and sometimes with complete silence .
this has happened despite the fact that only last month , jeremy hants said that his door is always open .
džeremijam hantam must take immediate action to stop inaction and cooperate with the new doctors .
if he does not do so , then the new doctors are ready for new protests .
during the last strike in late april were postponed for more than 13 000 routine operations and 100,000 visits , while nurses and consultants tried to replace doctors who had gone to picket .
ministers had hoped to end the dispute by reaching an agreement on changes to the treaty with representatives of the british medical association .
bma wants to raise the rate of work at weekends 54,000 new doctors , which would be subject to the new contracts .
nhs jobs executive director daniel mortimers invited the young doctors nedoties strikes .
mr mortimera explains that strikes does not solve anything , but only increases the pressure on the pressed staff and worry , causes stress and burden to patients , carers and their families .
in the last two months , we have spoken to the new doctor , and together with the ministry of health and other institutions have responded positively to their questions about aizgādniekiem and whistleblowers .
employers in the hopes that the active cooperation in other important issues , such as the deployment of staff , flexible training , in addition to training for those returning after a career break , the cost of training , training programmes for mutual recognition , leaving their studies and gender pay inequality in medicine - shows that employers , england health education authority and the ministry of health seriously wants to pursue an agreement entered into with bme in november , february and may .

zemgals proclaimed by the latvian state , but gratuitous has remained widely described the first latvian president john Čakstes and egypt during the last presidential ceremony at shade .
no one else from our statesmen are not so much stood up for democracy and the rule of law as zemgals , issued a decade ago gustavam zemgalam arnoldas auziņš writes a book .
in a conversation with the portal &quot; delfi &quot; auziņš stresses that zemgals is one of the few senior posts in the politicians , who had a sense of humour .
co. stīvi such , always very correctly .
he mācēja is not , these days it could be similar to what is raimonds vejonis .
&quot; he was the one who is close to the people , &quot; says auziņš .
modern politicians know bad history , they referred to karlis ulmani as a good leader , but rarely who knows how negants he had .
government meetings , the only person to whom he had not cried , been general dove .
in photos , even if he is nice and smaidīgs , by nature , he was hysterical .
&quot; zemgals with his sense of humour and democratic have exactly the opposite impression , &quot; says auziņš .

he was a quiet and measured man , whose long had to be persuaded to become president .
he netiecās himself after it , simply nealka glory .
he also was quite critical of himself , because he did not know of the french language , but believed that the president will certainly be able to .
&quot; the presidency of the french language , the foundations of both learned , &quot; explains shared .
zemgals neļāvās repeatedly to be pierunāts stand , he really did not like the top posts at all .
he respects the history of latvia is a very respectable figure , before being dragged into the presidential palace was a serious job - he was very requested by a notary public .
it zemgals led the famous zemgala treasury suvorova street 3 , where there were krājamatnieku and krājaizdevēju accidents , it practically government negotiations ended with the latvian state .
he was always open minded .
there was a great lover at , but he also did not object publicly .
&quot; private conversations and sometimes it is said that at the really have no sympathy for him , &quot; says shared .
living a peaceful life , there is no suspicion of irregularities or corruption .
as zemgalu remembers nowadays ?
sorry , but a large part of his associate only with a street in riga .

simple ways to help a child cope with anger seizures .
i often have to grapple with the fact that the child &apos;s anger , the anger of parents is considered something wrong and abnormal .
when the child openly show their anger - we do not know how to react , &quot; econet &quot; showing psiholoģe jekaterina kesa .
specialist encourages a small talks about these so natural and human feelings - anger and rage , which periodically going through each one .
aggression - it already has a physical activity , which is addressed to other people , and it usually occurs when feel angry .
when we , as adults , we are angry , upset - usually know what is happening to us and how to cope with it .
we niknumus their anger and ourselves can : express , to oppress , to hide , to keep ourselves , tell us about it to their friends or other loved ones , we can dusmās spārdīt sofa , uzsmēķēt a cigarette ( this is not the best way to address anger ! ) , to enter a shower , shoot at the kulaku across the table and do the other things that normally do not do .
we nevēršam their aggression against others , because we all know the various other ways of coping with these emotions .
children , when they were hit by anger , they do not understand what is happening to them , as they call it , and how to live with them .
they can say : &quot; go away ! , &quot; you &apos;re a fool , &quot; &quot; a bad mother , &quot; &quot; detest you , &quot; &quot; i with you nedraudzēšos &quot; - and very rarely , when he is able to say : &quot; i want you to my . &quot;
children living in a literal sense , they are fully located right here , in this moment , they are spontaneous and really my passion , and often also features a variety of emotions being held hostage .
it is very important that parents are a child neaizliegtu to show feelings , including anger , nekauninātu nerātos and about it , but on the contrary - to help the child .
or the relationship need pauzīti ?
a long working day where everything just has not happened as you would like , or simply a bad mood - there are so many reasons why would like for a few moments , days or even longer &quot; atslēgties &quot; from all over the world .
or perhaps for a moment iepauzēt also relationship and a little bit of a sigh of relief ?
or , however , it shows that each of the partners in their own way to go ?
their opinions are divided gentlemen at different ages .
janis ( 23 ) is a short and succinct : &quot; in my view , if the relationship need pauzīte , then you &apos;re not together with the right people . &quot;
bradshaw eduards ( 30 ) has revealed the scheme , which , perhaps , someone can help .
if you feel that you &apos;ve got a partner is starting to get on the nerves of every minor detail , then certainly - this is the right moment , when you should be looking at other hunting fields in order to understand whether or not you she is missing , or , in particular , don &apos;t think about him or even at all i don &apos;t want to see him anymore .
so the answer is yes , pauzītes withholding can help save time and to understand how important you are the second pusīte .
kaspars ( 29 ) reveals his theory .
i pauzīte needs to keep a relationship from each other on a daily basis , because if pavadi time with people 24 hours a day , seven days a week , then the disputes are inevitable .
they are due to the fact that pamani every detail , what the other is doing , and it &apos;s starting to get on the nerves .
people are beginning to tire of each other , especially when there is no longer even on what to talk only about what you &apos;re doing per day .
my personal experience leads to think of it , so i am also passed the relationship for more than a couple of months ago .
if you &apos;re just a moment thinking about the fact that elsewhere , or the other is better - so why is this woman , with whom you &apos;re together , deserves to be one who can think about the fact that there are not enough good and around the corner are havens fields ?
thinking alone is already a small betrayal .
if not , then it is not .
&quot; i have , therefore , a little condemn those who do not . &quot; says dr edmund ( 46 ) .
karlis ( 33 ) is almost completely the opposite view .
it seems to me that everyone needs a mere moment .
you can &apos;t go every moment , all the time , from morning to night to watch each other &apos;s eyes and līksmot of unfailing love .
attopies !
there are so many things - friends , work , the shooting .
everything has its own time .
of course , the friend or a wife , but if they know how to keep their līdzsvariņu between family life and the rest of the world , then it can live up to the grave .
it , and the only way .
martins ( 27 ) says this : &quot; it is hard to say - we need or don &apos;t need , may or may not take this pause , however , one thing is clear - they ierosinātājam something in the relationship until the end , something is missing . &quot;
if this question sounds , then , that in the near future there will be a change - for the better or the worse , it depends on ourselves .
i think as long as you &apos;re still young and crazy , meanwhile pauzīti need - something all the time , but when everything remains very seriously and the relationship is entering another phase , then there can be no talk about the rest .
however you choose to spend their entire lives together !
&quot; if you already can &apos;t stand each other &apos;s company and from time to time , need some breathing space , then that will be when you have people who are commenting on how garāmejošie cat ņaud or arguing about which day a better jāravē , &quot; said jobe ( 19 ) .

german researchers argue about &quot; the number of victims of the berlin wall &quot; .
according to a new study , the number of deaths in the former communist yoke of former east german border could be much higher than previously thought , but doubts about the true number of victims have still not been addressed .
according to data released on wednesday by the public of the berlin wall museum checkpoint charlie , during the period from 1945 until 1989.gadam areas along the border with western allies and the subsequent west germany communist authorities noslepkavojušas 1841 people who tried to escape from their controlled territory .
museum of border deaths is being studied for years , and every time adjusting the number of victims .
this year , added to the list of 11 more deaths , including among the victims , including a six year old boy who drowned in the family trying to get garnered through the then czechoslovakia and hungary .
among the young victims of the berlin wall is also the soviet army dezertieri .
&quot; the final amount of damage caused by the evil twin of communism and socialism , is not yet fully documented , &quot; said museum director alexander hildebrante .
&quot; our task is to ensure that the graves of those who died while trying to escape from the communist controlled country , would be given and not lost , &quot; says hildebrantes said in a statement .
but other researchers in the new figures have been questioned .
&quot; the figure of 1841 is unconvincing , &quot; in an interview with german newspaper süddeutsche zeitung says berlin &apos;s free university , an expert on the history of east germany johens Štāts .
he , along with other researchers at berlin &apos;s free university is currently reviewing the possible suspicious deaths at the border , and so far they have managed to approve only 260 cases .
previously , the researchers estimated that just in front of the berlin wall the communists noslepkavojuši 138 people .
having regard to those people who have died while trying to escape across the baltic sea , or to get to the west through the territory of neighbouring countries , after Štāta view , the number of victims could rise to around one thousand .
but it is still significantly less than in 1841 .
one of the reasons for the difference in the number of victims could be different methodologies .
checkpoint charlie museum also lists all the east german border guards in cases of suicide , regardless of whether they were directly related to their service .
the museum also lists the deaths , which are not related to direct violence .
&quot; if seniors aged 70 to 80 years after saraušanās with border controls died from heart attacks , &quot; it must be the &quot; murderous &quot; border effects , believes hildebrante .
but Štāts is sure to make the distinction between the elderly people who may have died as a result of their ill ones , and those whose death led to a lengthy wait during hot on the bus at the border .
regardless of the victims &apos; accounts is not easy , because the communist east german authorities did not accumulate such statistics , and researchers jāizvētī documents in various izkaisītos archives , showing Štāts .
however , the group has recently Štāta uzgājusi new documents , and therefore , in the near future it could come up with a new estimate of the number of victims .
he pone a traveled to rio with the coaching accreditation ; myself , this is a surprise .
in recent days , the sad recognition of the latvian peldēšanas federation ( a ) , kaspars pone rio de janeiro olympic games come with coaching accreditation , however , feel myself surprised .
on wednesday sparked a buzz after the olympic peldētājas aļonas ribakovas coach germana jakubovska rhetoric , who revealed that at the last minute decided to go to rio de janeiro pone , while to the manager to stay at home .

the latvian peldēšanas federation olympic games went on for five players , and even before departure aldons vrubļevskis argued that germans and he will be looking for tickets .
&quot; however , apparently objective reasons , he was not , &quot; said pone , expressing the view that it did not affect the outcome ribakovas .
at the request of the federation uvja coach took her to help .
pone , who himself is a member of the executive committee of the lok , strongly criticised the lok , laying the blame on an olympic sport pārraugošo organisation .
in my view , it is unethical lok &apos;s executive committee to approve the five individuals and one of them neaizvest .
&quot; i don &apos;t know why exactly peldēšanas federation there was not enough room , &quot; pone said that society has not appreciated the federation and the president &apos;s work , recalling that the federation presidents do not receive salaries .
it pone criticised the same jakubovski , expressing that , prior to the london olympic games , when ribakova were confirmed among the members , he was approached with a complaint at the international water sports federation ( fina ) and urged latvia not to send any athletes .
pone and could not tell us why he is the coach of the olympic games accreditation , which most likely was jāpienākas jakubovskim .
&quot; i was announced as the president of the federation ( &quot; team leader &quot; ) , but for some reason i received coaching accreditation and now nowhere netieku inside . &quot;
the situation changed every day , changed the number of accreditation .
until the very last moment , i think that the germans will be , because i had no other information .
the attorney did not have all the information , a few days before the ribakovas start she had a face to face conversation with poni and after the swimmer had with tears in the eyes , but the a &apos;s president said that it was a normal conversation with the desire to turn the athletes before the start .
pone recalled that a overseen five sports that are in the olympic programme , and four of them are also training children in latvia .
the president of the federation said that latvia is also very important issues of drowning and also on programmes such as he talked , while in rio de janeiro for nearly two weeks .
he praised the work of the federation , said that latvia could take place in 2018 world cup stage .
location of rio de janeiro is not my leave here , taking their time and try to realise the same programme .

spain &apos;s budget deficit reduction opportunities threatens was unable to form a government .
a month ago , on july 12 , the european commission ( ec ) came up with the opinion that spain and portugal have not implemented sufficiently costly measures to reduce the level of the budget deficit to the required 3 percent of gross domestic product ( gdp ) .
calculations show that , despite the austerity measures , portugal &apos;s budget deficit at the end of last year was 4.4 % of gdp , but in spain - 5.1 % .
however , the european commission has decided to impose economic sanctions on both countries , while at the same time , both the fiscal targets in the short term .
one of the reasons why the ec , however , did not implement the sanctions against the two countries , is growing euroscepticism in many countries of the european union .
additional sanctions such a negative mood will only increase .
but critics pointed out that the ec in its decisions are not consistent from the start by agreeing on common rules and then being able to apply them in real life .
so , for example , the german president jens bundesbankas veidmanns pointed out that europe is losing confidence in ourselves in this way , giving people the impression that the european union rules are as a recommendation rather than binding .
now , the ec proposed and all member states have agreed to extend the deadline for putting the budget deficit by the end of this year , portugal and spain by 2018 .
the european commission has promised in the next few months to check on the progress of the two countries , while pointing out that both spain and portugal have to be ready to introduce further austerity measures if circumstances require it .
initial forecasts suggest that portugal may be able to achieve the target in time and already this year , the deficit could fall to 2.5 % of gross domestic product .
this means that the stability programme in the country this year , the government has implemented austerity measures 0.25 % of gdp .
these measures should be included in this year &apos;s budget , the extra attention to the procurement of goods and services to control costs .
the spanish case , the situation is much more complicated .
this year &apos;s budget deficit to be reduced to 4.6 % next year - up to 3.1 % and in 2018 - to 2.2 % of gdp .
in addition , over the next two years , the consolidation measures every year to be 0.5 % of gdp .
particularly difficult these goals makes the fact that for eight months in the spanish political parties failed to agree on the formation of the government , and there is a growing possibility that spain may have for the third time in a year to hold early parliamentary elections .
but opinion polls suggest that the third elections in the country &apos;s political scene essentially unchanged .
it is still the most popular party in the current prime minister mariano rahoja , led by the people &apos;s party , which will once again get less than 33 % of the votes .
his popularity is a bit piqued only socialists , while against the austerity measures &quot; wing party podemos , &quot; or &quot; together we can &quot; and &quot; ciudadanos &quot; or &quot; citizens &apos; popularity is somewhat diminished .
the people &apos;s party wants the socialists and ciudadanos &quot; &quot; involvement in the government later this month , otherwise it will not be until the middle of october to accept and submit to the european commission for approval of the draft budget for 2017 .
as described by the people &apos;s party &apos;s parliamentary faction spokesman rafael hernando , if the government fails to establish and parliamentary elections will be held , however , also for the third time , spain will become a laughing stock all over europe .
the purity of beaches in the gulf of riga is critical .
the fifth year surveying beach , activists have concluded that , unfortunately , is growing every year , found the number of waste , and here are largely to blame for the visitors .
vispiesārņotākās bathing is directly in riga .
capital city council explains that the sites are $ sakoptas every day , but the fight against netīrīgajiem visitors is quite difficult .
in addition , land atstātie waste during torrential rain may be ieskaloti in water , thus far pabojājot its quality .
except in liepaja beach and some sites in kurzeme , the purity of beaches elsewhere in latvia is critical .
the campaign released the following statement this week , &quot; my sea &quot; volunteers .
the fifth year walking mērojot road along the gulf of riga , activists have concluded that the number of people left the waste has risen to every one hundred metres .
it kritiskuma assessment this year , unfortunately , has argued .
&quot; we can see that this will be the year when the number of waste on the beach 100 metres , perhaps even may exceed 200 units , &quot; says expedition &quot; my sea &quot; representative janis ulme .
latvian radio sazvanīts , he was tūjas beach , where volunteers will continue to march along the gulf of riga .
this year , between the various municipal waste and pikniku hangover activists had to collect even fluorescent light bulbs , which left mētājamies sea sand .
pārgājiena participant and organiser ulme say pollution is to blame for people .
&quot; the primary source is the same beach visitors , because more than half of the total number of waste is plastic , a variety of waste , starting with bags , plastic pieces , which is already in the stage of degradation , they can no longer be identified , and izsmēķiem , bottles , korķiem , &quot; ulme story .
between netīrākajām beaches are also sites in riga .
for example , the average daugavgrīvā every one hundred metres of waste collected nearly 800 units , which is much more critical .
the campaign organisers also explains that almost every step of throwing the cigarette butt and not everywhere deployed a warning or a ban on signs .
&quot; the average figures for all three of the riga bathing together - daugavgrīvu , vakarbuļļiem and vecāķiem - unfortunately get big and far exceeds the desired , or target , to which it is moving as latvia , until 2020 to reduce the number of units of waste up to 135 units , &quot; concludes a defender of the environment .
bathing cleansing in riga at the same time every day , summer karstākajās days even twice , said council spokesman uģis vidauskis .
however , the struggle with netīrīgajiem visitors is quite difficult .
we return to the people &apos;s cultural issue .
&quot; to those who damage , drink , smoke and do all the things that may not even special characters does not work , &quot; says vidauskis .
it vidauskis bathing invites visitors to report on polluters and the police .
you can call the police , sure to point to these violations and thus all the fight .
perhaps it can impose what new warnings , but , as i said , i don &apos;t think it will radically change the situation .
&quot; whereas all together and simply need to be tough on such offenders , &quot; he said .
in the meantime , the water quality measurements for the fourth time this summer by the health inspectorate , which can impose a ban on official sites .
this year , though , just like other years , the quality of water everywhere was good and satisfactory .
at the moment the situation is such that all 56 bathing water quality has been good all the time and there are no bathing cap .
&quot; we &apos;ll take it one last time for analysis at the end of august , &quot; says a senior environmental health specialist inspection normunds kadiķis .
during heavy rainfall on land atstātie ieskaloti waste can be in the water .
this , in turn , can affect the quality of it , says an environmental specialist .
the rotation of the russian elite will continue - putin &apos;s administration driving change .
left the office ?
vladimir putin said the russian media that sergei ivanov wanted to leave this post myself and in the future will be the president &apos;s special representative for environmental protection , ecology and transport issues .
announcing the changes , putin in front of television cameras ivanovam heaped praise : &quot; dear sergej borisovič , we have been working with you for many years and are doing it successfully . &quot;
i &apos;m happy with how you fulfil your duties to you .
i remember well on our agreement not to use you in the head of the presidential administration for more than four years .
so i am with the understanding against your desire to change the scope .
and i hope that the new post you fully use their knowledge and experience .
however , it highlighted that the presidential administration directing is a very important job , and it has turned into one of the most influential people in the country .
given that in russia next month ahead of the elections to the duma , those rumours that this step linked to the struggle for power in the russian political elite .
ivanov was also cited as a possible replacement for mr putin as president , so the assertion that he himself wanted to play the presidential representative nature and transport issues , raised doubts .
according lsm.lv archive , ivanov has the kgb and federal security service ģenerālpulkvedis .
ivanov has been an old and a close ally of russian president vladimir putin .
he specdienestos their enrolment began in 1975 , where he met with putin .
later , putin becoming the head of the federal security service , ivanov became his deputy .
while the first russian president boris yeltsin during the weekend , was appointed as secretary of the russian security council .
in 2000 , after putin &apos;s coming to power was confirmed ivanova &apos;s &quot; information security doctrine , &quot; which in russia , including the anticipated revival of state censorship mechanism .
was sergei ivanov became the russian defence minister , but as early as 2005 , the deputy prime minister mikhail fradkova and was responsible for the development of russia &apos;s defence industry and arms exports .
now , after leaving the office , the head of the presidential administration , ivanov also will retain the seat of the russian national security council , where it will work well , the new head of the presidential administration blames .
blame comes from a family of the soviet party elite .
the post of head of the presidential administration blames himself had recommended the ivanov .
we antonu eduardoviču have long been known . &quot;
another one of those times when your leadership worked in government .
and for the last almost five years we interact with practically every day .
&quot; therefore , i am convinced that , after all the professional and personal characteristics he is ready for the job , &quot; said ivanov .
blame comes from a family , which belonged to the soviet party elite .
his grandfather karl held high positions of the estonian communist party , including the ten years up to 1988.gadam was its first secretary .
the internet edition of &quot; meduza &quot; with reference to the book &quot; estonian self determination and independence , &quot; writes that at the end of the early karl blames had asked moscow to give permission to use force against the demonstrators .
however , he had received a refusal and soon lost his job .
shortly after the blame has moved to live in moscow .
antons blames graduated from the moscow institute of international relations and managed by the japanese language .
however , he has gone from the diplomatic service , to work in the presidential administration protocol .
as reported , the last nedāļās russia shaken by several high ranking officials dismissal and even arrests , including bamyan replaced several provincial and federal representatives .
as noted friday , president vladimir putin is rearranging the ruling elite before elections due in 2018 .
one of the main features - are increasingly in senior positions are representatives of the power structure .
putin also Ņikiforenko loses olympic games in the first fight .
this was the fight in the first round , and the latvian putin his participation in the olympic games have concluded , finišējot 17th place .
coach oleg baskins latvia when acknowledged that Ņikiforenko hopes have been very little , and it has already been clear before the tournament .
he also revealed that putin fight scored a shoulder injury .
it is notable that , in order to get the olympic road signs , Ņikiforenko had to stand in a different weight class than usual - namely , the weight category of up to 100 kilograms .
the azerbaijani wrestler was about 25 kilos heavier .
as reported , jevgenijs borodavko fight weight category of up to 100 kilograms against rjunosuki held up two and a half minutes , until inflicts managed a clean victory worth metiens .
consequently , latvia different european competitions rio has concluded .
dreams disappear into the rio in the sand .
on thursday inaugurated džudists jevgenijs borodavko .
yes , his face was titulētāks opponent , but the ambitious sometimes are capable of a surprise .
he nesagādāja .
there artūram Ņikiforenko task was made more difficult because the experience of the smaller opponent and also respectable .
a similar outcome , even on the tatami , he held up almost one and a half minutes longer than borodavko .
unfortunately , in recent times , the latvian džudistiem directly ambition lacks the most .
since the beginning of the federation leadership aside took gunars Ķirsons and his financial stute vladimir Šestakovs , from latvia drove alexander jackevičs , there are no more &quot; golden score &quot; - the development of different european lejupslīdošu moves along the curve .
jackevičam , which advises kazakh džudistus here , and vsevoldam zeļonijam heirs cannot see .
but if neaudzinās , also will not be .
and it is the prerogative of the federation .
therefore , as from other galaxies , &quot; says panorama latvian different european federation president promise to rio to win a medal .
flight far from reality . &quot;
in the evening , with impatience and concern waited for beach volleyball match , samoilovs / smedins - evandru / pedru solbergs .
intriga as the &quot; group of death &quot; - the losers game over .
the latvian duetam though there was a slight deviation - could also lose , but no more than four points with two / robezsardze .
there pieaudzēja putting a strain on the protracted in the previous game .
no one wanted to die - this feeling above vējainā korta europe throughout the whole match .
players brāzmainais winds caused additional complications .
at the beginning i thought that it might be ours - which is more comprehensive - ally .
but it did not .
there duetu against latvia &apos;s play was quite simple .
servē samoilovu so to stay when he plīsīs .
against canada ieplīsa , against cuba at the end of the first saplīsa seta and early in the third , because the load was not that for a joke .
smedins could go onto at the time , because there was little work , but when it was , it did a good job .
brazīliešus samoilovs / with / robezsardze Šmēdiņu was able to win in two , because the first took over the lead with 16 : 15 , but also to 16 remained , depleting also lost point limit .
but it also could have been lost with 0 : 2 , in the second game , the deficit was -4 , however , also thanks to the wind , managed to win .
the third was already evandru servju mark .
13.7 ķēdīte - inconclusive absorbed to serve , the second assist often fly too close to the grid and fruitful samoilovam remained very few options in attack .
if the game against the cubans were unknown to anyone , samoilovs , then this time he worked more effectively , and only to dump sašu loss would be in a professional manner .
kreilis also made a mistake , and quite symbolic that the last ball block drove directly to him .
losing the team .
this time , there were certainly also a success - in the third set only two evandru attacks almost flew out of korta , but the ball hit the line , however .
two of the cef was adjacent to the line .
the controversial episode video ruled in favour of the opponents .
if in the first two games with servēm evandru fuelled kranjec , then against ours they were very productive .
it summējās together a on the board .
now a calm analysis of the causes of the failure .
maybe should have as many live in adjacent stadionam , rather than along with the delegation in the olympic village .
on the way it took two and a half hours .
maybe a little assertiveness gave seven in the series .
perhaps the klagenfurt did not have to play , but soon to come here and better acclimatise .
maybe it was the failure of the sport of finding the top .
so far , the issue more than answers .
we bīčistiem games over .
the dream of the medals .
what next ?
yet few world cup tournaments and also the jurmala &quot; masters . &quot;
smedins with samoilovu life have never been friends , and they won &apos;t , because it is too different personalities .
but it also is not necessary .
when it collapsed dream of olympic medals , can also arise in the idea of divorce , because the fault will be sought not only for ourselves , but also for the film .
it is not difficult to decide , but there will be much more difficult to find a decent partner .
the two brothers playing bīču , but john with tom has already tried and also pašķīrušies , while mikhail samoilovs / is still too green to begin to conquer the world &apos;s mountains .
you can try to haraldu regžu , alexander soloveju , edgaru toču , return to mārtiņu pļaviņa , but it won &apos;t be better than this version , which is itself not once but showed the world cup stages .
they nesmaidīja kopakabanas sand this time . &quot;
and everything .
of course , also take into account the fact that the beach volejbols becoming more popular , new business is coming across , and only a few height is less than two metres .
it still does not guarantee success , but it is an important argument in the fight for victory .
our own longer remain .
both athletes and journalists have the opportunity mitināties games operators offered places , but also to choose their own .
the us basketball team live on a cruise ship , part of the players do not remain in the olympic village .
it is also part of the beach is volejbolistu sameklējuši kopakabanā hotel .
this time on journalists proposing the entire pieticīgajām unusual accommodation establishments were required greatly exaggerated prices .
that is also why the choice fell on the apartamentu .
the risk is , because sometimes they can be uncomfortable from a logistical point of view .
this time the risk are justified .
together with vladimir vladimiroviču lease to apartamentus kopakabanas and ipanemas boundaries .
beach 200 metres away , bīča arena suggest a march .
neighborhood safe enough , because the favelas patālu , but vigilance must not lose here , too .
vladimir vladimirovičs though not what one imagines immediately , but profesionālākais sports journalist krieviskajos media vladimir ivanov .
p.s. looks like that on friday morning , was izsapņots another medal dream .
the 100 metres in high jump barjerskrējienā and laura ikauniece-admidiņa lagged behind their personal records .
but there are already five disciplines .

it is this lack of political correctness in the opera , this tolerance izslēgums makes it so alive .
&quot; and yes , this mīlasstāsts is extremely strong , extremely beautiful and somehow really deep , &quot; says director viesturs kairišs .
what i love most - listening to or atskaņojot this opera , there is always some sticking points - the famous tones , famous motives , but the transition from one character to another , illuminating personāžu personāžu one or the other , or choirs , or orchestra .
&quot; it is so wonderfully exciting about this building , &quot; opera assesses the opera &quot; and &quot; besa porgijs koncertiestudējuma muzikālais driver and conductor lnso andris poga stressed .

in such a way that further action could be a purely logical .

&quot; in order to achieve the desired weight reduction results , very important to have the right combination of food choices , &quot; said lithuanian dietoloģe laura romeraite-kuklieriene .
in addition , it is easy to be done during the summer break , when our own gardens grow fresh fruits , berries and vegetables .
a combination of diet products can help not only to reduce excess weight , but also determined to promote a variety of bodily processes .
macaroni and vinegar is a successful combination , because it ensures a lasting sense of sāta and helps to fight fat .
research published in the journal clinical nutrition , demonstrated that the vinegar has a positive effect on glucose levels in the blood and helps us to feel mundriem .
kajēnas peppers and protein rich food , such as poultry meat or protein cocktail , creates not only a sense of sāta , but also reduces the thirst for great meals in the meals .
a combination of such meals can also increase after meals sadedzināto calorie content of up to 35 % .

the food flakes and berries contain fibre , which , according to the canadian scientists &apos; findings controlled grelīnu - appetite stimulating hormone - and thus also feeling hungry .
in addition , berries contain polifenolus , who is helping to reduce weight , and also prevents the formation of fat .
vegetables and protein also can work miracles in reducing weight .

lunch can eat chicken with lettuce or cook protein cocktails of the finished mixture and enjoy it together with my favourite vegetables .
the sort of product combinations to avoid .
is the fruit sugars - monosaccharides or disaccharides - one or work .
in contrast , starches , which is located in vegetables , is polisaharīds .
fruits splitting her stomach mechanically and chemically , they do not break down , to reach the third or fourth grade digestive process , which occurs in the intestine .
starch splitting into three different stages , which begins in the mouth .
it is therefore essential for europe to stop eating sweet immediately after meals .
eating sweet immediately after meals , it is &quot; in &quot; her stomach , along with other meals , where it is not chemically sagremots and start pūt .

arbūzs , medusmelone , muskatmelone and other melons always eat separately from other meals .
melons are not sagremotas , if they are in her stomach , along with other foods .
fat , in combination with protein rich foods .
fat is made up of a successful combination of starch , however , the same cannot be said of fat and protein , fat inhibits protein sagremošanu .
proteins can be combined with a very small amounts of fat .
if they consume large quantities of products containing protein , avoid fat consumption altogether .
this also applies to svaigēšanu - not advisable to combine large quantities of nuts ( contains proteins ) with a whole avocados ( contains fat ) .
such a combination of effective weight reduction .
how better to cook ?
&quot; cooking , thermal processing creates significant loss of nutrients - around 15 % to 55 % of the original nutrient composition of the product , &quot; says dietoloģe .
in most cases the nutrients are wasted by boiling water in food products .
however , some of the nutritional value of food products is growing , it is boiling .
after the vegetable cooking liquid exploded it is advisable to use soup to - in this case the nezaudēsiet nutrients that are left behind in the water , and they can eat it later .
recommended cook vegetables , steaming them as well .
tomato thermal treatment significantly increases the constituent likopēna biopieejamību .
boiling tomatoes for 30 minutes , likopēna quantity will increase by 25 % .

bear in mind that freezing products can reduce the amount of vitamin c from 10 % up to 90 % , while fibre freezing does not affect .
beans , in combination with the tomatoes can increase the intake of iron in the body , which in turn provides a better brain and muscle activity .
our organism accommodates up to 33 % less not-asinsradošās iron , which can be found in plant foods such as beans , leaf zaļumi , cereals , than asinsradošās iron , which is found in animal products such as beef , fish and chicken .
you can significantly increase the not-asinsradošās iron absorption in the body by ingesting no-asinsradošo iron contaminated products , along with the sources of vitamin c , such as oranges , tomatoes and well .
vitamin c helps to change the not-asinsradošo iron so as to make it easier for our body to absorb .
iron is needed hemoglobīna production , which provides oxygen channelling muskuļos and brains .
to get the maximum benefit from the lettuce , attach them with healthy fats , such as olive or linseed oil .

in a statement issued on thursday , the congress of deputies points out that the us central command representatives transformed reports , depicting the war against the islamic state in iraq and syria much better terms than it is in reality .
central command intelligence analysts expressed a general dissatisfaction with the armed forces committee , the intelligence committee and the defense finance subcommittee republican representatives set up task teams interim report , pointing out that their leadership controlled by reports of american success in the fight against the islamic state .
central command , known as centcom , is a military base tampā , florida , which oversees us military operations in the middle east and central asia .
the latest news about this report says that intelligence reports , which was endorsed by senior leaders of centcom , reflects the u.s. fight against terrorism more positively than it is in reality . the facts were routinely rigged , depicting the better performance than other intelligence analysis shows .
california republican representative ken kalverts says : &quot; centcom behaviour is unacceptable - our soldiers are the ones who suffer , if our policy makers get false reports . &quot;
centcom management mistakes in the organisation &apos;s top management .
this 10 page long report detailed description of the existing problems in the central command coverage and analysis of american efforts to prepare the iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015 .
although it does not provide a robust body of evidence that the obama administration senior officials would be forced to distort reports , but it shows that centcom leadership has done a certain amount of pressure on analysts to portray optimistiskāku vision of the islamic state ( also known as ) or isil ) threat .
the report shows that in the first half of 2015 central pārvaldniecības press releases , statements and reports to congress portrayed the situation significantly positive image than it actually was .
for example , representatives of the centcom publicly announced that the recovery operation in mosul could begin as early as april or may of 2015 .
mosul is iraq &apos;s second largest city , which is still under the control of the islamic state .
kansas republican representative mike pompeo says in its report : &quot; several months of investigation it clearly shows . &quot;
from the middle of 2014 until the middle of 2015 , the us central pārvaldniecības key officials distorted reports , depicting ) threat in iraq weaker than they were in reality .

the ministry of defence conducts ģenerālinspekcija centcom intelligence activities in the investigation .
intelligence committee &apos;s democratic party members on thursday released its own report , which they agree with some of the republican party task force &apos;s conclusions .

mr Šifa explains that this process &quot; stopped the dissemination of information , &quot; exacerbated by the analysts &apos; work ethic and &quot; spread the truth irrelevant facts . &quot;
but Šifs and democratic party members added that there was no evidence that the district attorney nams have exerted pressure on centcom analysts so that they develop reports , &quot; according to a previously established or political position . &quot;
the daily beast on thursday published a congressional investigation into the preliminary results .

the investigation is not just a question of whether the american bombing campaign in iraq and syria is successful ( the assertion that expresses more and more representatives of the ministry of defence ) .
but last year &apos;s accusations calls into question whether president obama can fully rely on the central pārvaldniecības reports on military operations in iraq , afghanistan and other hotspots .
criticism of the islamic state intelligence recalls the events of more than ten years old , when general gregory hūkers centcom intelligence analyst , published a study claiming that george v. bush administration launched the war in afghanistan , too little thinking about the possible consequences .
hūkers also played a significant role in the islamic state intelligence at the opening of the issue .

period of depression nomācošākais food is &quot; sātīgā meals &quot;
in march 1933 , shortly after his election as president ovālajā frenklins delano roosevelt sat in the room , so for withholding a meal .
it rūzveltam president of fine culinary delikateses such as goose liver pastēte or acknowledge and maryland turtles soup .
but that day his meals were well allowing cooperation : looking eggs are immersed in the tomato , potato biezputra and desertā - pear pudding .
džeina ziegelmane says : &quot; this is a way to show solidarity in cooking with people who times were very hard . &quot;
it kou her husband added : &quot; it is also a message to the americans , how to eat . &quot;
a couple from brooklyn heights district is food historians .
kou &apos;s last book &quot; dārzeņu sautējums &quot; describes the chinese cuisine in america , but ziegelmane apple trees in his book &quot; 97 &quot; describes life through meals rental home in the eastern manhattan earners .
he sātīgā new joint work &quot; meals , &quot; which will be published on tuesday , the publishing house harper , is the story of american food during the great depression .
displaying a certain solidarity on gastronomy , they had a meal together reporters , &quot; eisenberg &apos;s sandwich shop , &quot; a simple lunch ēstuvē located flatironas district and has been in operation since 1929 , when the great depression .
54 years old mrs ziegelmanes commissioned sviestmaizi with sakapātām fused magnesia are cheese and olives , while the 57 year old kou ordered a turkey , potatoes and vegetables biezputru marron .
when the reporter was commissioned by the fake birds , the couple admitted that his choice is very appropriate conversation about the great depression time meals .
she ziegelmanes said that the bogus bird was very popular .
there was a peanut bird , liver bird and beans bird .
they were made from basic ingredients and other ingredients to fill out a meal .
imagined , as it is eaten zemesriekstus - so much so that they would have lunch instead .
mr kou novaibstījās .
&quot; probably felt that the stomach is full of lead , &quot; he added .
pirmsdepresijas years american dining table was akin to a swedish table , especially in rural areas .
women prepared to eat their husbands to workers and for breakfast , lunch and dinner was served fresh made sacepumi .
first world war sent directly to americans , europeans meals . &quot; sātīgā meals &quot; describes how the americans pielāgojās circumstances , when america was suddenly no longer the land of plenty .
&quot; at that time , food became the american people &apos;s attention on a daily basis , &quot; says kou said , explaining why he and his wife wanted to write directly on this topic .
just as important was the new budget diet : unknown dishes such as bogus bird and sautējumi became an everyday life , sautējumi was &quot; a great way to use leftovers , &quot; said mrs ziegelmanes , because chefs could bury nepievilcīgās ingredients below krēmīgas sauces .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap žāvētie fruits .
the meat , which for years was the main ingredient of the american meals , now became extremely rare luxury goods .
at a time when the number of calories and nutritional value of food was more important than taste , was born a new , yet unparalleled formations .
in the ancient pavārgrāmatā ziegelmanes president found a recipe and cook with peanut butter pildītus sīpolus .
mr kou added : &quot; it was not a popular addition to the dinner table . &quot;
she ziegelmanes said : &quot; it was surreal . &quot;
peanut butter and cepts sīpols are not compatible .
many homes meals recipes piemērojās difficult times . &quot;
they luīze household economists such as stanley , head of the federal office for the household economic from 1923 until political year , set the country &apos;s eating habits , which were not seen before the great depression , not after it .

&quot; sātīgā meals &quot; is a historic gardumu mielasts .
particularly interesting is the evidence of the government &apos;s treatment of its own citizens to hungry , for example , president herberta hūvera &quot; let me eat cake &quot; attitude .
although he has talked publicly about his humble childhood and meals iowa , in fact he ate as a fine miljonārs , about what he had become .
mr kou said : &quot; he enjoyed the cuisine , such as fish with cucumber sauce . &quot;
he apzeltītā viesistabā ate almost , wearing the dinner jacket .
he was completely detached from reality . &quot;
president roosevelt would have made the same mistake , unless his wife eleonora had not recommended him to set an example with their eating habits .
the book told that roosevelt nolīdzis domestic workers , whose nemācēja preparing to eat , along with the district attorney nams became a place &quot; where not only was presented one of visnegaršīgākajiem meals in washington , but also the worst pagatavotajiem meals . &quot;
as soon as the country &apos;s economy atkopās , most of the depression era culinary customs disappeared .
but we continue to focus on energy and nutritional value , as well as how to apply the science of gastronomy , &quot; added mrs ziegelmanes .
the couple says that when writing a book , they gained a greater understanding of the ziegelmanes &apos;s mother &apos;s eating habits , for example , why she was unable to throw out food .
&quot; she really was afraid to throw out food , &quot; said mr kou .
she ziegelmanes said : &quot; she actually tracināja people . &quot;
there kūkām was the incident with the wind .
when we were fed eisenberga ēstuvē , writers pulled out of a couple of bags at home either desertu : pear pudiņu by president roosevelt used to eat lunch .
&quot; this is a pear putukrējums , &quot; said mrs ziegelmanes , adding that at the time was the widespread habit of frugal meals to give šiku name .
it putukrējuma not only prunes , a little flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
all impatient dipped karotes brūnajā tangled , located on the plates .
surprisingly , it was not quite so bad .
mr kou apēda a few .
izklausoties after an experienced &quot; an economist , &quot; he said to his wife : &quot; suit šķipsniņa samaltu lazdu nut . &quot;

in addition , it will also be unpredictable side effects , because kausētava consumes approximately 10 percent of all electricity in victoria .
in 2014 the alcoa point henry smelter shut &quot; &apos; , which led to the power plant angleseas recess .
portland alkoas kausētava working with losses and may be shut down .
these events led to several years of speculation about the rise in the value of the australian dollar and the cost of production factory .
factory energy supplier &quot; agl , &quot; supplying energy from their &quot; loy yang a power station &quot; latroubes valley , says that it is unlikely that the other three owners go out of their contracts .
most of the power plant is owned by alcoa &quot; &quot; and &quot; alumia &quot; character , in addition to the company &apos;s shares are owned by the chinese &quot; citic &quot; and &quot; japan &apos;s marubeni corp.-scale holdings at present companies .

starting from 2018 fiscal year &apos;s potential impact on profits is constrained by favourable market forecasts for wholesale electricity prices in the future .
&quot; agl &quot; claim that the projections are already ierēķinājis loss of 187 million dollars , provided that these contracts will be terminated .
&quot; alcoa &quot; sends a message that the decision to terminate the contracts will not affect &quot; alcoa &quot; opportunities to continue kausētavas activities or to supply it with energy .
the us company says that in 2010 , it has entered into a contract with &quot; loy yang &quot; of 20 years ago , but in november it will be terminated . the company does not comment on why it will suspend cooperation .
analysts have expressed concern about the possible closure of the portland kausētavas victoria and the tomago plant closures near the Ņūkāstlas , industry due to the weak economy .
&quot; agl , &quot; executive director steven mikelsons said last week that , after analysts &apos; estimates portlenda year spend 600 megavatus and tomago 900 megavatus energy .
if both of these plants would move away from the energy market , then energy demand would be significantly reduced .

community legal centre each year , rejects 160 000 people .
each year are rejected more than 160 000 people requirements , in addition to shrinking budgets , the situation could deteriorate .
three of the five people flooding in queensland - mostly pensioners , immigrants , vulnerable workers , victims of violence and those who do not have the resources to fight illegal evictions , denied free legal assistance and representation .
community legal centre , which is already overloaded , warns that declining funding , the situation will only become worse .
from next june , these legal centres will receive a 30 % less funding than in the past .
queensland legal centre director james farels said that the latest report from the national legal centre association says that at the moment , legal aid is being denied to thousands of people who need it .
mistrs farels pointed out , if this decision is not reversed , then the situation will only become worse .
he also said : &quot; the queensland legal centre constantly receives insufficient funding , this means that assistance is being denied to thousands of people who need it . &quot;
people who are trying to end a violent relationship , people with deep debt , families who is going through a divorce , workers who unfairly dismissed - all these people have legal problems , and this report shows that they do not receive the necessary assistance .
from june 2017 , the federal government will cut funding by 30 percent , which means that there are thousands of queensland &apos;s population will have to deal with their own complex legal problems without assistance .
we call on the attorney general and the queensland senatoru george w. brandisu immediately stop funding cuts , so that people who need legal assistance , it can get .
last year , the government has revealed its plans to raise the level of legal aid to the national average .
now it is time to draw attention to the local communities and their customers &apos; needs and palazčuka government to invest in this important area .

britain is to keep the olympic spirit and to expand heathrow .
heathrow will not only contribute to the prosperity and growth in local regions and in london , but also across the country .
this , in my view , makes heathrow very attractive , as well as in 2012 in london , where we spent an enormous amount of work , so that all regions of the country would benefit from the olympic games .
stratforda and Īstenda won an awful lot of the olympic games .
and we will do this again , with local residents and businesses with business opportunities near heathrow .
local communities as we will create 10,000 new business opportunities , 40 000 new jobs and finally let us put an end to youth unemployment around heathrow .
just like the london olympic games in 2012 , and this time there will be people who will argue that this challenge is too big and that the expansion of heathrow is too ambitious .
back then , people said that britain would never fail to prepare for the olympics , and that it will be a global disaster .
the sceptics wrong for 2012 and also at heathrow , they will not be right .
there is always the obstacles to be overcome , but heathrow so far has overcome everything .
like the olympic games , heathrow is the infrastructure project that will benefit society as a whole , rather than individuals .
enlargement has the potential to generate up to 180,000 new jobs , economic growth 211 billion , creating the ground for both employment and experience in the airport and across britain .
heathrow is an excellent team , which has led to 11 billion pounds &apos; worth of infrastructure investment programme , within the timeframe and budget , starting with the terminal 5 , which for five years from the site has been named the best airport terminal in the world and ending with the terminal 2 , which is built between two skrejceļiem used more intensively in the world .
now they are ready to build a third runway , which will be funded by private investment of 16 billion pounds per year .
the 2012 london olympics was a great success , and i am confident that this will also be the expansion of heathrow .
it is time to revive the olympic spirit and to expand heathrow , ensuring the future of our trade and creating a new employment environment , with which britain can be proud of .

because of my neighbour &apos;s repair man comes to sadrupušiem ceiling and forced to leave their homes .
atv programme &quot; 4.studija &quot; went to dmitry saidjaševs , whose neighbour started kapitālo repair in his apartment , and since then the plaster of the broken drūp dmitri from the ceiling and there is no certainty that it is safe to stay in the apartment .
the problem is that my neighbours carried out arbitrary construction and my apartment is damaged ceiling .
then i informed the riga būvvaldi , house managers and other organisations .
būvvalde said that we are not a call centre and we do not have any expert .
&quot; the apartment owner must go latvia &apos;s chief ally , and from there will be an expert , &quot; says dmitry .
stands pieaicinātais expert , fiksējis what happened and admitted that pārsegums reportedly unsatisfactory condition .
but since the first dmitry būvvaldē application a month , and until the beginning of this week it also no one was unable to answer , or the location of the apartment is not a life .
it būvvaldē said - that is the law , expect , if you are not satisfied , the campaign all in a row .
&quot; then wrote to the riga city council , but they forwarded the house manager , then the manager of būvvaldi house again , and then it is at a dead end , &quot; says dmitry .
after examining all the pile of paper , it is clear that the works are stopped , even if every time you can hear that someone is working there .
yet two months were needed expertise and six months , the apartment owner , who carry out repairs , all of these defects were eliminated .
the independent expert has drawn up its own opinion , but būvvalde deemed incomplete and superficial .
an expert has not indicated whether it is affected by the current metal režģojums nesošajā design , so there is no guarantee that the bottom apartment owner creates a threat .
&quot; that &apos;s why we have asked for further clarification from the expert , &quot; the story of the riga city būvvaldes spokeswoman ilze Žūka .
despite the ban on any repairs upper apartment , from there ever hear that construction will continue .
the punishment for arbitrary construction without building permits are from 70 to 700 euros , but in this case the punishment can be much worse .
while it is expected an expert opinion , būvvalde decided that the two apartments may not operate - though it takes place works , both dmitry flat .
&apos;this būvvaldes practice is unprecedented in this way , their ignorance or simply because of the reluctance of people , perhaps , created a threat not only in his possession , but also in the bottom of the property owner , and as a result the owner cannot exploit their property , &quot; says būvvaldes spokeswoman .
dmitri now need to look for another place to live - in front of relatives , friends , in a hotel or rent another apartment .
but the damage dmitry may try to recover from a neighbour &apos;s civil round , which both can take a very long time .
both sides of the arbitrary construction of apartments to stay at the moment is forbidden until construction engineers will give its verdict , and it may have to wait up to three weeks .
losses will be borne by the owner of the apartment , which underwent repairs .
the owner of the apartment because būvvaldes said is not taken into account , also faces a prison sentence of up to six months .

nasa climate model : venēra ever been an inhabitable planet
based on the latest nasa climate models , venēra ever has been an inhabitable planet .
nasa &apos;s goddard institute for space studies , scientists have developed a model to explore the history of venus , using tools and algorithms , which are also used by climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine whether to venus , whose surface is hot , where there is no water , and the atmosphere is made up almost exclusively of carbon in the earth in the past , there have been similar circumstances .
scientists have previously raised speculation that venus slow turning speed is due to a solid atmosphere .
but the latest simulation shows that on venus once had a plan , similar to the atmosphere of the earth and its griezusies slowly .
the model also looks at the venus topography .
on the planet have been more dry areas than on earth , but they had enough water and geographical diversity , that could lead to life and not to allow the water to evaporate .
early times of venus saule was about 30 percent spožāka .
giss model exercise held venus turning model reveals that the days of the bright part of it lasts 2 months , the press release explained giss scientist anthony del genio .
this process of unifying the planet &apos;s surface and causes the rain , which in turn is made up of a thick cloud layers , which acts as an umbrella , protecting the planet from the solar heat .
the result is a temperate climate temperature , which is actually a few degrees lower than the temperature on earth today .
the model depicts the history of venus , which is similar to the theory of evolution , which in their hipotēzēs developed by scientists .
although in the past it has been an inhabitable , several billion years venēra been exposed to too much hot and violet rays .
they izgaroja oceans , and garaiņus izdedzināja ultravioletie on them .
the water fully izgarojot , above left only plan for carbon dioxide in the atmosphere with deadly greenhouse gas - venēra , as we know it today .
the scientists published a new venus climate model results in the journal &quot; geophysical research letters . &quot;

a north sea oil platform workers return to the negotiating table and postpone strike
workers &apos; strikes on a north sea oil platform workers &apos; pay has been postponed because both parties to the dispute are renegotiated , according to negotiators .
periodically against the oil processing company , &quot; wood group &quot; is being held strikes on north sea oil platforms , where the company operates &quot; royal dutch shell . &quot;
in the joint statement says that &quot; wood group &quot; and &quot; unite &quot; and &quot; rmt &quot; unions agreed to resume talks on resolving the dispute .
over the next few weeks are designed for a full day of meetings , which will begin early next week with a view to reconsider the outstanding issues .
the unions said that their recent actions , which organised after more than 25 years later , is directed against the planned pay cuts of 30 percent .
the negative market pressures , &quot; wood group earlier this year reduced the wages of workers in the north sea by 9 per cent .
in 2014 , the company has already reduced the road workers &apos; wages by 10 per cent .
the company explains that the additional salary cuts would allow the company to survive the market downturn .
while the &quot; shell &quot; has already reduced the salaries of several thousand people and announced plans to stop the oil and natural gas operations in 10 countries , in order to optimise their work in preparation for large scale merger deal with british energy company bg group &apos; . &quot;
energy companies are under pressure from falling oil prices , in addition to the situation all the more complicated by britain &apos;s decision to leave the european union .
at the beginning of the week the scottish parliament member dave he met with workers &apos; representatives to discuss one of the most important issues - the north sea strike plans .
he said that the north sea is vital to the region &apos;s economy .
in his report , he explains that the north sea and the country as a whole for the economy , from which all derive benefit , rather than individuals .
in 2016 , the new projects in the north sea are expected to invest nearly $ 1.4 billion , compared to $ 7 billion invested in the last five years .
keplers size stars turning speed plejādes zvaigznājā .
the latest keplera telescope mission has helped astronomers with to gather the fullest catalogue of stars turning speed plejādes zvaigznājā .
the new data will help astronomers with understand why stars in this zvaigznājā turns at different speeds , as well as the way in which stars turning speed applies to the formation of the planet .
&quot; we hope that the comparison of our results with other zvaigznājiem , we get more information on the relationship between the mass of stars , age and even the history of the solar system , &quot; said caltech news edition pasadenas infrared procesu and analytical center researcher luisa rebula .
plejādes zvaigznājs located 445 light years away from earth .
many of the stars in this zvaigznājā just starting to rise , reaching around 125 million years old .
it turns with a maximum speed .
spinning with a maximum speed of these rising stars emit large amounts of stars in the wind .
it magnētiskajā winds entering the stars , they are slowing down stars .
stars as they get older , their turning speed is decreasing .
keplers measured each stars turning speed , setting a time between recognisable stars district , for example , sun spaces , appearance .
the latest stars turning speed catalogue shows that more stars moves more slowly than smaller stars .
rebuls compares the stars with dejotajiem , more other dancers perform piruetes slower than little other dancers .
rebuls tells us that &quot; plejādes baletā &quot; shows that slowly revolving objects are bigger and masīvāki , while faster revolving facilities are very small stars .
it plejādes zvaigznājs that are so close , it serves as a great space laboratory , where you can compare the characteristics of the stars with turning speeds .
rebuls tells us that plejādes zvaigznājs helps build theoretical models of star rotation in both directions , both older and younger stars .
we still have a lot to learn how , when and why did slow down the speed of stars turning and stopping to complete the process .
she rebuls and colleagues presented a detailed analysis of the plejādes stars turning speed of three new publications , which will soon be published in the astronomical journal .
