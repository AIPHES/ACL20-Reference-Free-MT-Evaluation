russia and turkey : izstumto alliance ?
it was a gesture , which has put an end to the crisis .
the russian and turkish leaders met on tuesday to sarokotos and announce the eight months of the war baigām and economic sanctions .
but vladimir putin sveicinoties with turkish leaders sanktpētrburgas palace , the impression that ankara is it that this partnership is needed the most .
despite this , the two sarokojās .
smiling for vladimir putin looked aprauts and was not caused by warm emotion , even after his usual standards .
in contrast , guest tayyip erdoğan was going to call putin on his &quot; dear friend &quot; , repeating it at least five times , according to a survey of the meeting .
i nojuka number .
he also promised that relations with russia uzlabošoties not only to the pre-crisis levels , but even better .
the next day , a newspaper reported that erdoğan uzvadoties as if something bad had happened .
i am his enthusiasm was caused by conflicting feelings .
but from putin &apos;s izstarojošā vēsums showed that the russian leader has not forgotten .
the first , which he mentioned in his speech , was the downing of the russian aircraft on the syrian border .
at the time , moscow has reacted strongly .
putin has accused ankara of dunča ieduršanu moscow wearing .
pāridarījums was seen yet sāpīgāk , given that it came from a friend .
restore the real confidence will be very difficult , if not impossible .
since november , the russian public position and has changed .
for several months , the government controlled television announcing widespread hostility to ankara .
suddenly , it seemed that the whole was guilty of the turks .
the most acute was the accusations , which reported that the erdoğan family to make a profit in the illegal oil trade with islamic state controlled parts of syria .
he himself fully denied .
however , in st petersburg was a hint that it &apos;s time to forget the past .
after all , this meeting took place only because putin received an apology from president erdoğan .
russia could be seen as a kind of victory .
ankara benefit from a peace settlement is clear to all .
first of all , it is necessary for all erdoganam iespejamie friends , after he was nearly overthrown in last month &apos;s coup attempt .
the numerous terrorist attacks have shaken his lines .
and there is also the economic motives .
russian sanctions have caused substantial damage , especially in the charter ban , which typically provides a turkish beach with several million russian tourists each year .
this figure fell by almost 90 % .
the russian tūroperatori and čarterkompānijas will breathe easy when scheduled flights will be restored .
they are hoping to seasonal izskaņas leave fever in the mediterranean sea .
already this week , state tv for fruit and vegetable prices fall , which will be returned to turkey &apos;s fruit and vegetable imports .
as was quoted as saying by the local newspaper vedemosti : &quot; tūristus them , tomatoes us . &quot;
but the visit was also other political motives from moscow .
ankara is angry to the west of , in their view , the weak response to the coup attempt .
the whole can pieskatīt and protracted negotiations on the accession to the eu and putin &apos;s intervention , who would like to use the situation that turkey and the west &apos;s relationship is atvēsinājušās .
the russian leader certainly was the winner , providing support for the coup and the de facto authorities after the attempted coup .
please note that moscow is afraid of regime change in the country .
the summit , held in the coastal gleznajā palace , gave russia and turkey in the present , as one analyst described it , &quot; izstumto alliance &quot; , the two countries , who feel excluded from the west , joining forces .
but despite the public demonstration of unity , between the two countries is considerable differences .
one of them is syria , where russia presents itself as a peace in the media , but where russia and turkey supports the other side .
after more than three hours long discussions the two presidents at the press conference revealed that they are not even touched on this issue .
turkish president purposefully avoided questions about the differences between the two countries , meanwhile , president putin mentioned the only separately .
there is no real clear , as the two countries could find common ground on syria .
but after several months of open hostility and potential disaster , when nato member turkey by russian warplanes , the situation has improved , as the two leaders have relaunched the talk .
royal bank of scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of scotland
skb offisa zīmolam will continue to play the role of the bank &apos;s ceo , said .
outside the scottish skb will no longer be available .
ross said makevans bbc channel in scotland , skb brand was an associated with the bank &apos;s global ambitions .
it has abandoned them , because eight years ago bankb almost went bankrupt and was necessary financiāla assistance .
in the meantime , the brand stratēģisti has used skb brand in order to protect other consumer financial brands .
the bank received millions of pounds from international sport , from the six nations rugby and finally with the junior wimbledon title tennis champion andy mureju .
however , it has now been decided to give the other nacionalajiem brands to gain popularity .
scottish royal banaka will be made available to the scottish customers , but will not be made public .
skb in england and wales in the future there will be a key ofisa and stock market , but the rest of the way frančīzes will be changed to the name of the natwest .
the ulster bank brand is already being used in the republic of ireland and in northern ireland .
now attention will also lower the private financial brands , for example , coutts , adam &amp; co , drummond , and holt &apos;s military bank .
makevans was intervēts izbrauciena time with customers and employees by invernesšīru .
he told bbc scotland : &quot; skb channel will become our investors &apos; brand and it will be given more attention , because now we become more about brand of banking . &quot;
by the time the bank itself became a global brand and also skb became a global brand .
now i say that we are no longer a global ambition , we have local ambitions .
each of these brands will represent something unique , each in its sector and our staff will work with customers below these brands .
skb has already announced that it will not &quot; the six nations &quot; sponsorship and calls on the people of the other brands to participate in-sponsors .
&quot; it is the right time to become a brand of banking , because the banks have long since we have been asking ourselves how to become better banks to their customers ? &quot; says executive director .
it would have been a very cynical , where three years ago , we would have said that we will become a great bank for our customers and will develop these brands .
but thanks to the hard work and focus on the customer , rather than our own needs , we have made changes .
we can once again to revive these brands , so i think that now is the right time .

russian president putin &apos;s dismissal of the administration sergey ms
russian president vladimir putin dissolved the unexpectedly adminsitrācijas leader sergey ms .
ivanov for many years been putin &apos;s closest circle of people .
at 63 years old politician has appointed a special representative of the natural and transport issues .
the kremlin statement said that putin &quot; decided to release ms from the russian presidential administration driving duties &quot; , without giving any reason .
ivanova instead of the antons vaino , who was appointed his deputy since 2012 .
the 44 year old vaino is a former diplomat .
vaino was born in 1972 in the estonian capital , tallinn , graduated from the prestigious moscow state institute of international relations ( mvsai ) and later worked at the tokyo embassy .
according to the kremlin &apos;s website ( in russian ) , later he led the presidential protocol and government employees administration .
after the appointment , he putin said : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
i think the administration &apos;s main job is to support your work in the country &apos;s president , drawing up laws and controlling your decision .
putin on friday told a russian broadcaster off air that ivanov himself wanted to leave their posts and recommended vaino as a substitute .
will grins convinces ?
this step embarrassed about that moscow .
sergei ivanov old and close to vladimir putin ally and , like putin , had worked for the soviet security service of the kgb .
in this capacity , he was one of the most influential men in russia .
state television during the session of the meeting , the two men announced that ivanov to resign on his own initiative .
but despite a series of cameras smaidiem , rarely with such a statement reassuring , especially ahead of parliamentary elections .
is this outcome is linked to the fight for power ?
that no one knows .
however , the claim that the man who was considered a possible president himself , suddenly wanted to become the head of russia &apos;s environmental policy , has been met with scepticism .
the kremlin &apos;s new set of remarks ivanov told putin : &quot; it is true that in the beginning of 2012 i would you ask me to this difficult position , one might even say the problematic , within four years .
it turns out that i have worked in office for four years and eight months .
ivanov took office in december 2011 .

when putin came to power , he called ms to five people including , whom he trusted most .
putin &apos;s second term at the end of ivanov was considered a potential russian presidential candidate , as putin &apos;s re-election to a third term would be unconstitutional .

putin became prime minister , and after three and a half years ago , returned to the presidential office .

on the ground , only found the weapon into the chamber čaulītes belonging to different weapons .
it seems that it has been a long-lasting shelling .

why do we need the mayor , gabiju and lauriju .
that is what i call this year &apos;s women &apos;s olympic vieglatlētu komandu and there are several reasons for this .
first of all , i have been to all the summer olympic games since 1984 and the us team has never been so good .
secondly , this team is made up of three vieglatlētēm , construed , bailsas gabijas duglasas laurijas hernandezas and that inspires many young girls of another race .
people can be proud that this team is also alja raismane who is jewish and madison kociana , which is a catholic , .
finally , the team looks like america .
it has also been strengthened by the black and latin american athletes &apos; participation in this sport .
over the last four years have been the best vingrotāja afroamerikāniete .
last year , simona and gabija took 1 and 2 .
they are impressive results .
approval of the olympic games gabija duglasa , surprisingly , became an olympic champions and america could līksmot .
now the world has seen these neticamos vingrojumus , which met the triple world champion simona bailsa , duglasa and laurija hernandeza fulfilling impossible , but impressive vingrojumus .
on thursday smerikānieti simona became the fourth in a row , which has won the gold medal to individual daudzcīņā women .
her team biedrene alija raismane won the silver medal .
we have seen the best of what this sport can bring , but elsewhere in the country , the situation is different .
simona , gabija and laurija entered the olympic are just as alija and madison .
they are the &quot; olympic piecinieks &quot; because the next olympic gymnastics team consist of only four athletes and this is the last year treneres martas karolas treneres at work .
the truth is that exercise is an expensive sport and vingrotāji above all trenējas private &quot; clubs and their parents , which pays for training , accommodation , travel , hotels , formastērpiem ( coaches , athletes and their families ) and other expenses .
most of these &quot; clubs are located in urban areas , which can afford this kind of sport .
these clubs athletes are discharged of all their training and it is expensive and long contribution to andersen families .
&apos;ca būrmana - construed bailsas time and maggie - hainija laurijas hernandezas trenējušas time is their female since they both began to vieglatlētiku .
we must ensure young girls , who inspires simona , gabija and laurijas cheaper gymnastic training opportunities .
the eu their &quot; organisation founded 20 years ago .
in my organisation , which is located in hārlemā , we offer more than 15 000 urban young people ( mostly black and hispanic origin ) gymnastic exercises for free or at low cost and we have also trained the national and international champions .
in september , we will discover a branch in detroit ( my home town ) , in order to ensure that local young people the opportunity to get to know this great sport .
vieglatlētika develops strength lokanumu and body coordination , and also teaches hard work , discipline and commitment to the goal .
this combination ensures a long life with good health and success both at school and at work .
this team will inspire thousands of young girls to train with vieglatlētiku and it is fantastic .
to deal with this sport is very important , especially for young girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank you , simona , alija gabija and madison , for the excellent &quot; girls &apos; force &quot; demonstrations , winning the olympic gold medal and motivating countless new , different race girls to become healthy , strong and successful young women .

the president , who remained in the shadows : gustavam zemgalam - 145 .
on friday , 12 august , marks the 145 years since the second born in latvia , the president of the country gustaf zemgals .
zemgals was proclaimed by the latvian state , but gratuitous has remained broadly described the first latvian president john Čakstes and the pre-war period in the last presidential charlemagne ulmaņa in the shadows .
no one else from our statesmen who are not as a champion of democracy and the rule of law as zemgals , ten years ago issued gustavam zemgalam arnoldas auziņš writes in the book .
&quot; in a conversation with the portal delfi &quot; auziņš stresses that zemgals is one of the few senior posts the politicians who had a sense of humour .
the other such stīvi , always very correct .
he mācēja so far , nowadays , it could be similar to what is raimonds vejonis .
&quot; he was the one that is close to the people , &quot; says auziņš .
modern politicians know bad history , they referred to the charles ulmani as a good leader , but rarely who knows how negants he had .
the government &apos;s sessions , the only person to which he had been kliedzis , gen. balodis .
even if he is nice and smaidīgs in photos , after natural he was hysterical .
&quot; zemgals with his sense of humour and democracy have exactly the opposite impression , &quot; says auziņš .
university of latvia , professor of history and philosophy faculty aivars that an interview with &quot; delfi &quot; agrees with the assessment of auziņa zemgalu as a peaceful and weighed valstsvīru .
he also notes that the zemgals originated with respect for minorities , regularly called on the jewish representatives to the presidential palace .
&quot; at the time , it was not normal behaviour , after zemgala albert kviesis took over the presidency this tradition , &quot; says historian .
he was a quiet , measured man , whose long had persuaded to become president .
he himself after it netiecās , simply nealka &apos;s .
he also quite critically praised himself , because he did not know what the french language , but felt that the president will certainly be able .
&quot; during the french version of the foundations of both learned a &quot; , explains that .
zemgals neļāvās again be pierunāts to stand as a candidate , he did not like the top posts at all .
for all practical purposes , he is very much a respected figure in the history of latvia , before being dragged into the presidential palace was serious office - he was in great demand for a notary .
it zemgals was led by the famous zemgala treasury suvorova street 3 , where regionsomalia krājamatnieku and krājaizdevēju association , it practically government negotiations led to the latvian state .
he always had progressively inclined .
it was not a big fan of ulmaņa publicly , but he also did not object .
&quot; in private conversations and , at times , has said that really ulmaņa activity , notes that &quot; no sympathy for him .
nodzīvoja a peaceful life , in the absence of any suspicion of irregularities or corruption .
as zemgalu remembers nowadays ?
it is a pity , but much of what he has been associated only with a street in riga .

simply ways as a child to help cope with anger seizure .
i often have to grapple with the fact that the child &apos;s anger , fury of parents is considered something wrong and abnormal .
when the child openly show their anger - we do not know how to react , &quot; &quot; econet psiholoģe jekaterina kesa .
urges speciāliste a small negotiating on these so natural and human feelings - anger and rage , which periodically going through each .
aggression - it already has a physical activity , which addressed to other people , and it usually appears when feel angry .
when we , as adults , we are angry , upset - usually know what is happening to us and how to deal with it .
we their anger and niknumus we can express ourselves : , to suppress , hide , to keep ourselves , to tell you what my friends or other relatives , we can anger spārdīt sofa uzsmēķēt a cigarette ( this is not the best way to address anger ! ) , enter a shower , shoot at goal because they think the kulaku across the table and do other things , which are usually do .
we nevēršam its aggression against the other , because we know the various other ways to deal with these emotions .
children , when they are hit by anger , they do not understand what happens to them , as they call it , and how to live with them .
they can say : &quot; go away ! &quot; , &quot; you &apos;re a fool , &quot; the bad mother &quot; , &quot; neieredzu you &quot; , &quot; i love you &quot; nedraudzēšos - and very rarely , which is able to say : &apos; the eu to you my anger . &quot;
children living in a literal sense , they are perfectly located right here , at this point in time , they are spontaneous and genuine their passion , and often also are located in different emotions in captivity .
it is very important that the parents of the child not to show feelings of anger , including nekauninātu and nerātos on it , but on the contrary - to help the child .
will relations need pauzīti ?
a working day , where everything is not exactly happened as you would like , or simply a bad mood - there are so many reasons why would be the time of day or even longer &quot; atslēgties &quot; from all over the world .
is it possible for a moment iepauzēt also relations and a little bit of a sigh of relief ?
or , however , it shows that each of the partners in its own way to go ?
in their views are divided gentlemen at different ages .
janis ( 23 ) is a short and succinct : &quot; in my view the relationship , if necessary , then you &apos;ve pauzīte together with the right people . &quot;
in the meantime , eduards ( 30 ) has revealed the scheme which , perhaps , someone can help .
if jūti that partner is starting to make you fall takes its toll on the nerves of every minor detail , then certainly - it is the right moment , when should look at other hunting fields , in order to understand whether you she is missing , or particular about their thinking or even generally don &apos;t want to see him anymore .
so the answer is yes , the withholding of pauzītes can help save time and understand how important you are the second pusīte .
kaspars ( 29 ) reveals his theory .
in my opinion , the relationship is to keep a pauzīte from each other on a daily basis , because if pavadi time with people 24 hours a day , seven days a week , then the controversy is inevitable .
they are caused by the fact that the pamani every detail , what the other is doing , and it is starting to fall takes its toll on the nerves .
people are beginning to tire of each other , particularly if there is no longer even on what to talk , only about what you &apos;re doing in the day .
my own experience leads to think so , so also have not passed the relationship for more than a few months ago .
if you think about it , even for a moment that elsewhere or the other is better - then why this woman , with whom you &apos;re together , deserves the , who can think about the fact that there is not enough and well behind the mountains are havens of the countryside ?
thinking alone is already a small betrayal .
if not , then it is not .
&quot; i have , therefore a little condemn those who are not . &quot; says edmund ( 46 ) .
bulans ( 33 ) is almost completely the opposite view .
it seems to me that all need a moment some highlights so far .
can &apos;t you every moment , all the time , from morning to night to look each other in the eye and rejoice in the creation of enduring love .
attopies !
there are so many things - friends , work , at the time of the shooting .
everything has its own time .
of course , a friend or a wife , however , if both are able to keep their līdzsvariņu between family life and the rest of the world , then it can live up to the grave .
it and only it .
martins ( 27 ) say it : &quot; it is hard to say - or not , may or may not take to pause , but one thing is clear - they ierosinātājam something relations until the end is not , something is missing . &quot;
if this sounds , then have to face the fact that in the near future there will be a change - for the better or worse , it depends on the same .
&quot; i think as long as there are new and crazy , meanwhile pauzīti need - despite all the time , but when everything remains seriously and relationship to enter a new phase , then the rest is out of the question .
you choose to spend their whole lives together !
&quot; if now can &apos;t stand each other &apos;s company and from time to time , need some breathing space , then that will be when you will be pensioners , who said the cat garāmejošie ņaud or arguing that day zoo better jāravē , &quot; said kristaps ( 19 ) .

german researchers discussing &quot; the fall of the berlin wall &quot; of the number of victims .
according to a new study , the number of fatalities at the former communist yoke of the former east german border could be much higher than previously estimated , but doubts about the true number of victims still have not been addressed .
according to data released on wednesday by the public of the berlin wall museum checkpoint charlie , during the period from 1945 until 1989.gadam along the border with western allies zones and the subsequent west germany communist authorities noslepkavojušas 1841 people who tried to escape from their controlled territory .
the with border deaths is being studied for years and every time adjusting the number of victims .
this year , the list added 11 more deaths , including among the victims , including a six year old boy who drowned in the family trying to get garnered through the then czechoslovakia and hungary .
among new victims of the berlin wall is also the soviet army dezertieri .
&quot; the extent of the damage caused by the evil twin of communism and socialism , has not yet been fully documented &quot; , &quot; says museum director alexander hildebrante .
&quot; our task is to ensure that the graves of those who died while trying to escape from the communist country to be controlled , and i lost , &quot; says hildebrantes said in a statement .
but other researchers of the new figures have already questioned .
&quot; the figure of 1841 is unconvincing , &quot; in an interview with the newspaper süddeutsche zeitung argues the berlin free university of east german history expert johens Štāts .
he , along with other berlin free university researchers are currently reviewing possible suspicious deaths at the border , and so far they have managed to approve only 260 cases .
previously , researchers estimated that only at the fall of the berlin wall the communists noslepkavojuši 138 people .
given the number of people who have died trying to escape through the baltic sea or get in the west through the territory of neighbouring countries , after Štāta view , the number of victims could reach around 1,000 .
however , it is still significantly less than in 1841 .
one of the reasons for the differences between the number of victims could be different methodologies .
checkpoint charlie museum lists all of the east german border guards suicide cases , regardless of whether they were directly related to their staff .
the list also deaths , which are not related to direct violence .
&quot; if seniors aged 70 to 80 years after saraušanās with border controls died from heart attacks , &quot; it must be the &quot; murderous borders &quot; consequences , believes hildebrante .
but Štāts is convinced that draw the distinction between the elderly people who may have died as a result of their treatment we faced , and those whose death sparked a hot time waiting for a bus at the border .
irrespective of the inventory is not easy , because the communist east german authorities did not accumulate the following statistics , and researchers jāizvētī documents in the archives , notes izkaisītos Štāts .
however , the group recently Štāta uzgājusi new documents , and therefore in the near future , it could come up with an estimate of the number of new victims .

&quot; i was announced as the president of the federation ( &quot; team leader &quot; ) , but for some reason i received accreditation coach and now nowhere netieku inside . &quot;
the situation changed every day , changed the number of available accreditation .

the attorney &apos;s information , a couple of days before starting ribakovas she had a conversation with an eye for an eye and poni after the swimmer was in tears in the eyes of the same lpf , however , the president said that it had been a normal conversation with the desire to turn the athletes before launch .

revenue kolegova head office &quot; will move to the last . &quot;
in his words , now prime minister maris kucinskis ( greens and farmers union ) and finance minister dana reizniece-ozola ( the greens and farmers union ) is already a &quot; fundamentally important &quot; to the revenue service manager of the finance minister put forward candidates kolegova .

spain budget deficit reduction potential threat was unable to form a government .
a month ago , on july 12 , the european commission ( ec ) presented the opinion that spain and portugal have not implemented sufficiently costly measures to reduce the budget deficit to the required level of 3 % of gross domestic product ( gdp ) .
calculations show that despite the austerity measures implemented by portugal &apos;s budget deficit at the end of last year was 4.4 % of gdp , but 5.1 % in spain .
the european commission , however , decided not to apply to both countries to economic sanctions , while at the same time setting fiscal targets in the short term .
one of the reasons why the ec , however , did not implement the sanctions against those two countries , is growing euroscepticism in many countries of the european union .
further sanctions such negative mood only to build .
critics and points out that the ec in its decisions are not consistent , from the beginning of the agreement on common rules and then failing to apply them in life .
for example , the german bundesbankas president jens veidmanns pointed out that europe following a loss of confidence in ourselves , giving people the impression that the european union rules , as a recommendation is not binding .
now the ec proposed and all member states have agreed to extend the deadline for putting the budget deficit by the end of this year until 2018 to portugal and spain .
the european commission says the next few months to check on the two countries &apos; progress , while at the same time pointing out that both spain and portugal must be ready to implement further austerity measures , if it will require conditions .
initial forecasts suggest that portugal may be able to achieve the target set by the deadline and already this year , the budget deficit could fall to 2.5 % of gross domestic product .
this means that the stability programme , the government of this country this year is to implement austerity measures of 0.25 % of gdp .
these measures should be included in this year &apos;s budget , the extra attention to the procurement of goods and services cost control .
the spanish case , the situation is much more complicated .
this year , the budget deficit to be reduced to 4.6 % next year - by 3.1 % and in 2018 - to 2.2 % of gdp .
in addition , over the next two years , the consolidation measures every year to be 0.5 % of gdp .
the complex these objectives for the fact that for eight months of the spanish political parties have failed to agree on the formation of a cabinet , and there is a growing chance that spain may have for the third time in a year to hold early parliamentary elections .
but opinion polls suggest that the third elections of the political landscape in the country essentially unchanged .
fidesz widened its current prime minister mariano rahoja , led by the people &apos;s party , which will again get less than 33 % of the votes .
the popularity is only slightly piqued the socialists , while against the austerity-podemos &quot; or &quot; together we can &quot; and &quot; ciudadanos &quot; or &quot; citizens &apos; popularity has slightly decreased .
people &apos;s party wants the socialists and ciudadanos &apos; participation in the government before the end of this month , otherwise it will not be until mid-october to adopt and to submit to the european commission for approval of the 2017 draft budget .
as one of the people &apos;s party parliamentary faction spokesman rafael hernando , if governments fail to establish and parliamentary elections , however , will be held for a third time , spain will become a laughing stock across europe .
pludmaļu the purity of the gulf of riga is critical .
for the fifth year screening beach , activists have concluded that , unfortunately , is growing every year , found the number of waste , and here are largely to blame for the visitors .
vispiesārņotākās bathing is directly in riga .
hundreds of city council , explains that the sites every day on sakoptas but to fight against netīrīgajiem visitors is quite difficult .
in addition , sauszemē atstātie rainfall during the waste can be treated water , thus far pabojājot its quality .
except in liepaja beach and some sites in kurzeme , beaches of cleanliness elsewhere in latvia is critical .
such a statement released this week of the campaign &quot; my sea &quot; volunteers .
for the fifth year feet mērojot road along the gulf of riga , activists have concluded that the number of people left the waste at every hundred metres has increased .
unfortunately , this year it kritiskuma assessment has argued .
&quot; we can see that this will be the year when the number of waste on the beach in the 100 metres , perhaps even may exceed 200 units , &quot; says expeditions &quot; my sea &quot; spokesman janis ulme .
latvian radio sazvanīts , he regionsomalia tūjas on the beach , where volunteers will continue to move along the gulf of riga .
this year , between the various household waste and a hangover activists had to collect even fluorescent light bulbs , which left mētājamies in the sand of the sea .
pārgājiena participant and the organiser ulme say pollution are directly to blame for the people .
&quot; the main source is the same beach visitors , as more than half of the total number of waste is plastic , various waste , starting with the bags , plastic pieces , which is already the depletion of the stage , they can no longer be identified , and izsmēķiem , bottles , korķiem &quot; , says ulme .
among the netīrākajām beaches are also sites in riga .
for example , daugavgrīvā a hundred metres on average , collected nearly 800 waste unit , which is so much .
the campaign organisers also explains that almost at every turn mētājoties also butt and not everywhere deployed or ban the warning signs .
&quot; the average figures for all three of the riga bathing areas together - daugavgrīvu , vakarbuļļiem and vecāķiem - unfortunately shall meet high and far exceeding the target or targets , to which it as latvia moves to reduce waste by 2020 the number of items up to 135 units , &quot; concludes a defender of the environment .
bathing cleaning in riga noritot every day , summer days karstākajās even twice , explains duma representative uģis vidauskis .
however , the fight with netīrīgajiem visitors is quite difficult .
we are returning to the people &apos;s cultural issue .
&quot; to those who piemēslo , drink , smoke and doing all the things that may not even special characters does not work , &quot; said vidauskis .
so vidauskis calls for bathing visitors to report on polluters and the police .
it may be called the police , sure to point to these violations and , in a way , all the fight .
perhaps it can impose what new warnings , but , as i said , it is unlikely to radically change the situation .
&quot; as all together and simply need to be tough on these offenders , &quot; he stresses .
meanwhile , the water quality measurements this summer for the fourth time , carried out by the health inspectorate , which can impose a ban on official sites .
this year , though , like the other years , the quality of the water everywhere is a good and decent .
today , the situation is such that in all 56 , bathing water quality has been good all the time and there are no bathing cap .
&quot; the last time we &apos;ll take it at the end of august , &quot; the analysis says a senior specialist in environmental health inspections normunds kadiķis .
strong rainfall during the land atstātie waste can be treated in the water .
this , in turn , may affect the quality of it , the environmental specialist .
the rotation of the russian elite will continue - putin &apos;s administration driving change .
it left the office ?
vladimir putin , russian media reported that sergei ivanov himself and wanted to leave the post in the future will be the president &apos;s special representative for environmental protection , ecology and transport issues .
in announcing the changes , putin in front of the television cameras ivanovam heaped praise : &quot; dear sergej borisovič with you for many years , we are working together and doing it well . &quot;
i am happy with how you are up to you in the course of their duties .
eu remember well on our agreement to leave you in the head of the presidential administration for more than four years .
that is why i am with the understanding of your desire to change the scope .
and i hope that the new post you to fully use their knowledge and experience .
however , it is the highlight of the presidential administration driving is a very important job and it made ms as one of the most influential people in the country .
given that in russia next month ahead of the elections to the duma , those rumours that this step is linked to the struggle for power in the russian political elite .
ivanov was also called on the alleged putin &apos;s replacement as president , so the assertion that he wanted to hold presidential representative for the protection of the environment and transport issues raised doubts .
according to lsm.lv archive , ivanov is the kgb and the federal security service col.-gen ..
ivanov has been an old and close to the russian president vladimir putin ally .
he launched its own rhythms specdienestos 1975 , where took note with putin .
later , putin became the head of the federal security service , ivanov became his deputy .
meanwhile , the first russian president boris yeltsin era weekend was appointed as the russian security council secretary .
putin in 2000 after coming to power ivanova was approved by the &quot; information security doctrine &quot; , including in russia was the country &apos;s censorship mechanism revival .
but sergei ivanov became the russian defence minister , but already in 2005 - the prime minister mikhail fradkova and was responsible for the development of the russian defense industry enterprises and arms exports .
now , after the head of the presidential administration , leaving ivanov also will retain the seat of the russian national security council , where it will be the new head of the presidential administration vaino .
vaino comes from a family of soviet party elites .
the presidential administration head office vaino had recommended the same ivanov .
we with antonu eduardoviču have long been known .
one of those times when , under your leadership , worked in government .
and the last almost five years , we are in contact in practically every day .
&quot; therefore , i am convinced that after all the professional and personal character he is ready for the job , &quot; said ivanov .
vaino comes from a family , which belonged to the soviet party elite .
his grandfather karl held senior positions in the estonian communist party , including ten years up to 1988.gadam was its first secretary .
internet edition &quot; meduza &quot; with a reference to the book &quot; self-determination and independence , &quot; writes that at the end of the peshawar karl vaino had asked moscow to authorise the use of force against the demonstrators .
however , he had received a refusal and soon lost his post .
shortly after the vaino has moved to live to moscow .
antons vaino graduated from the moscow institute of international relations and managed by the japanese language .
however , he has gone from the diplomatic service , in order to work in the administration of president .
as reported , the last nedāļās russia been shaken by a number of senior officials of the dismissal and even arrests , including replaced several areas of bamyan and federal representatives .
according to friday , president vladimir putin restructuring the ruling elite ahead of the next election .
one of the main features - are increasingly to senior positions are representatives of the power structures .

azerbaijani wrestler was on 25 kilos heavier .
rebels jevgenijs borodavko fight in the weight category up to 100 kilograms against rjunosuki noturējās two and a half minutes , until in the clean victory was worth litter .
so the latvia comprised race at the rio has concluded .
disappears sapņi rio in the sand .
led ceturtdienu džudists jevgenijs borodavko .
yes , his face was titulētāks an opponent , but the ambitious sometimes has the ability to surprise .
he nesagādāja .
artūram Ņikiforenko task was even more complicated , because the experience less and opponent of the respectable .
the result of a similar , even on the tatami he noturējās nearly a minute and a half longer than borodavko .
unfortunately , the last time the latvian džudistiem most directly to a lack of ambition .
since the management side of the federation took gunars Ķirsons and his financial stute vladimir Šestakovs , drove from latvia aleksandr jackevičs , no longer the case &quot; golden score &quot; , - comprised development are going through lejupslīdošu curve .
jackevičam here , and advise the kazakhstan džudistus vsevoldam zeļonijam heirs cannot see .
but if neaudzinās , also will not be .
and it is the prerogative of the federation .
therefore , as from another galaxy &quot; morning &quot; the panorama also says the latvian džudo federation presidential promise rio to win a medal .
the far from reality . &quot;
in the evening with impatience and concerns waited for beach volleyball match , samoilovs / smedins - evandru / pedru solbergs .
intriga as the &quot; group of death &quot; - the losers of the game over .
latvian duetam though there was a small deviation - could also lose , but no more than the four points in two setos .
saspringumu yet pieaudzēja protracted in the previous game .
no one did not want to die - this feeling over vējainā europe korta throughout the whole match .
ongoing support brāzmainais winds caused additional complications .
initially it seemed that it could be ours - which is comprehensive - an ally .
but did not .
against latvian duetu to play here was quite simply .
so servē to samoilovu and they would kill when he plīsīs .
against canada ieplīsa , against cuba saplīsa seta at the end of the first and third at the beginning , because the load was not that for a joke .
smedins at that time could go onto , because the work was a little , but when it was , did it very well .
samoilovs brazīliešus with Šmēdiņu was able to win two setos , because the first took over the lead with 16 : 15 to 16 , but also remained , depleting also lost ) limit .
but could lose also with 0 : 2 , because the deficit in the second set was -4 , however , also thanks to the wind , managed to win .
the third already close-evandru servju mark .
veidojās ķēdīte - unconvincing absorbed to serve , the second floor often fly too close to the network and samoilovam remained very little version of the resulting attack .
if against cubans square was an alien to samoilovs , then this time he worked better , and only to dump sašu loss would be in a professional manner .
the kreilis was wrong , and quite symbolic that the last ball block trieca it was him .
zaudē team .
this time , certainly was also a success - in the third set only two evandru attacks almost flew out of korta , however , but the ball hit the line .
two of the cef was next to the line .
the controversial episode 9eda0133b79d ruled in favour of the opponents .
if the first two games evandru struggling with servēm against ours , then it was a very productive .
all together summējās a on the board .
now calm analysis of the reasons for failure .
perhaps it should have been as many live next to the stadium , rather than with the delegations in the olympic village .
a it took two and a half hours .
maybe a little confidence gave seven of the final series .
maybe klagenfurt should not have to come here to play , but faster and better acclimatise .
perhaps it was the failure of the sportiskās forms of the discovery .
meanwhile , the issue more than answers .
our bīčistiem game over .
the dream of medals over .
what next ?
a few of the world cup tournaments and also the city &quot; masters &quot; .
smedins with samoilovu life has never been friends and there will not be , because it is too different personalities .
but it also is not necessary .
when the fall of the dream of olympic medals , may lead to the idea of divorce because the fault will be sought not only for ourselves , but also a film .
my backing is also supported by is not difficult , but much more difficult in latvia will have to find a partner .
both brothers play bīču but janis with tom has already tried and also pašķīrušies , while mikhail samoilovs is still too green to start to conquer the world of mountains .
you can try to haraldu regžu , alexander soloveju , edgaru toču , to return to the mārtiņu pļaviņa , but it will be better than this week , which itself not once but confirmed the stages of the world cup .
nesmaidīja kopakabanas sand them this time .
and all .
of course , should also take into account the fact that the beach volejbols are becoming more popular , new business is coming across , and only a few height is less than two metres .
it still does not guarantee success , but it is a vital point in the fight for the victory .
longer mūsējie not .
both athletes and journalists are able to stay games organisers proposed locations , but also to choose their own .
us basketball team are living on the cruise ship , part of the players do not remain in the olympic village .
it is also part of the beach hotel volejbolistu sameklējuši kopakabanā .
this time , the journalists proposing the whole pieticīgajām naktsmītnēm was required greatly exaggerated prices .
that is also why the choice fell on apartamentu rent .
the risk is , because sometimes they can be uncomfortable from a logistical point of view .
this time the risk are justified .
together with vladimir vladimiroviču lease apartamentus to kopakabanas and the ipanemas borders .
pludmale 200 metres away , bīča arena for the half-hourly march .
neighborhood safe enough , because the favelas patālu , however , should not be vigilant to lose here too .
vladimir vladimirovičs though not what some might immediately imagines , but profesionālākais sports journalist krieviskajos media vladimir ivanov .
p.s. it seems that on friday morning , was izsapņots another medal dream .
100 metres barjerskrējienā and in high jump laura ikauniece-admidiņa lagged behind their personal records .
but there already has five disciplines .
after 10 years , &quot; porgijs and &quot; besa sounds in liepaja .
latvia &apos;s opera &quot; porgijs and &quot; besa pirmiestudējumu experienced in 1973 , the latvian national opera .
since then , the internationally renowned masterpiece is not in .
that is why cesis arts festival and liepaja arts forum organizers in close cooperation decided to give listeners the opportunity to enjoy the george gēršvina šedervu .
&quot; we are very pleased that after a decade , when the last time in liepaja was able to enjoy the opera production , this excellent george &quot; and &quot; besa gēršvina porgijs koncertiestudējuma baudāma opera version is new to us , &quot; jaunatklātajā in this concert , &quot; says &quot; this is the driving baiba bože .
besa opera &quot; porgijs and &quot; is engraved on musical language izstāstīts tale of love , its mutability , passion , as well as domestic tragedies and simple everyday spree .
it reflects the afroamerikāniskā vitality , music and rhythm .
it is this lack of political correctness in the opera , this tolerance of waiver makes it so alive .
&quot; and yes , this mīlasstāsts is extremely powerful , extremely beautiful and somehow really deep , &quot; says director viesturs kairišs .
what i love most - listening to or atskaņojot this opera is always such stopping points - the famous tones , the famous motives , but the transition from one character to another , highlighting personāžu personāžu one or the other , or choirs , or the orchestra .
&quot; this is what is so wonderfully exciting about sitting in this building , &quot; the opera assesses the opera &quot; and &quot; besa porgijs koncertiestudējuma muzikālais driver and conductor andris poga wants riga .
opera visitors are in agreement that it is a very ambitious event .
they have a great pleasure that will hear the world famous gēršvina opera .

māra lāce muzeja director , acknowledged that addresses pārreģistrēšana will create a long red tape , but , on the whole , this idea is welcomed by the local government and therefore agreed to the proposal .
riga city of some sort of a central pillar of this idea has laid , creating a 1936.gadā burkarda dzeņa rozentālam janim monument , which stands at the museum .
the then museum director of vilhelms purvītis was one of the initiators of this monument building .
in this way , the further action could be a purely logical .
i am a little bit grauž conscience and all the time - but vilhelms purvītis , where we will make his name ? !
&quot; but if you , america , mr apsolāties thinking &quot; ... said lāce .

my approach coincides with the church , recommended that lay at the heart of the gospel message of life .
to show that evaņģēlijs responds to human life vissasāpējušākajām problems and give him inspiration further route .
then it address to the people .
but cēsīs , lamps discussion , you said that &quot; to go back to the understanding of the full of people . &quot;
what do you get it ?
does this mean that people are turning away from the church of the message ?
and whether the church today is such a return of resource ?

augļos is the sugars - monosaccharides or disaccharides - one or two molecules compounds .
in contrast , starch , which is located in vegetables , is polisaharīds .
fruit chemically decompose her stomach mechanically , while they do not break down , to reach the third or fourth grade the digestive process , which takes place in the intestine .
starches lived in three different stages , which begins in the mouth .
therefore , it is important not to eat them at the sweet immediately after meals .
the sweet Ēdot immediately after meals , it is being &quot; stuck in &quot; her stomach , together with other meals , where it is not chemically sagremots and starts pūt .
neēdiet bread , potatoes , peas , bananas , dateles or other products containing carbohydrates , together with lime , lemons , oranges , greipfrūtiem , ananasiem skābiem or other fruit .

fat is a successful combination of starch , but the same cannot be said of the fat and protein , fat prevents protein sagremošanu .
proteins can be combined with a very small amount of fat .
if they consume protein products containing a large amount of fat , you would use altogether .
this also applies to svaigēšanu - is not advisable combination of large quantities of nuts ( contains proteins ) with a whole avocados ( contains fats ) .
this combination of effective for weight reduction .
how better to prepare ?
&quot; the catering , thermal processing poses a significant nutrient loss - around 15 % to 55 % of the products of the original nutrient composition , &quot; notes dietoloģe .
in most cases the nutrients are lost , food products in boiling water .
however , some of the nutritional value of food products is growing , it is boiling .
after the remaining liquid vegetable cooking it is advisable to use soup - in this case nezaudēsiet ingest nutrients that are left behind in the water , and they will be able to eat it later .
dārzeņus advisable to cook , and steaming .
thermal processing significantly increases the tomato regionplacechina the likopēna biopieejamību .
tomatoes vārot 30 minutes , likopēna amount will increase by 25 % .

congress of auditors announces that military officials sagrozījušas reports on the islamic state of israel .
a statement issued by the congress of deputies points out that the us central command , representatives of the transformed reports , depicting the war against the islamic state in iraq and syria , much better terms than it is in reality .
central command intelligence analysts expressed general frustration on the armed forces , the committee on intelligence and the subcommittee on defense finansēšaans republican representatives of the task unit of the interim report , noting that his leadership was under the control of the reports on the american success in the fight against the islamic state of israel .
the central command , known as centcom , a military base tampā , in florida , which oversees us military operations in the middle east and central asia .
the latest information on this report says that intelligence reports , which was approved by senior leaders of centcom , reflects the u.s. fight against terrorism more positively than it is in reality . the facts were regularly misreported , depicting the better performance than other intelligence analysis shows .
california republican representative ken kalverts said : &quot; centcom is unacceptable behaviour - our soldiers are the ones who suffer , if our policy makers are making false reports . &quot;
centcom management errors in the organisation &apos;s senior management .
this 10 pages long report detailed description of the problems of the central command coverage and analysis of the american efforts to prepare the iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015 .
although it does not provide strong evidence that the obama administration &apos;s senior officials would have led to distort the reports , but it shows that centcom leadership has done some pressure on the analysts to portray optimistiskāku vision of the islamic state ( also known as ) or targeting ) threat .
the report shows that in the first half of 2015 central pārvaldniecības press releases , statements and reports to congress depicted a positive image of the situation than it was in fact .
for example , centcom representatives have publicly stated that the mosul operation could begin in april or may 2015 .
mosul is iraq &apos;s second largest city , which is still under the control of the islamic state .
kansas republican representative mike pompeo &apos;s report says : &quot; several months of investigation that clear . &quot;
from the middle of 2014 until mid-2015 us central pārvaldniecības key officials distorted reports , depicting it , ) the threat in iraq weaker than they were in fact .
the republicans also set up a working group to learn that analysts are concerned that the information on the islamic state is being distorted .
the investigation continues , the report issued on thursday will be followed by new discoveries in this case .
ministry of defence ģenerālinspekcija centcom intelligence activities carried out an investigation .
intelligence committee members of the administration of the democratic party on thursday released its own report , which they agree on some republican findings of the group .
democratic representative adams b. Šifs in his report , from 2014 to 2015 centcom too limited intelligence assessment reports ) and in conjunction with the iraqi security spēkiem .
Šifa president , explains that this process &quot; stopped the dissemination of information &quot; , has been exacerbated by analysts work ethic and &quot; spread the truth inadequate facts . &quot;
but Šifs and democrats added that there is no evidence that the white house has kept the pressure on the centcom analysts to produce reports , according to the &quot; previously established or political position . &quot;
the daily beast on thursday published a congress of the preliminary results of the investigation .
in august , the new york times reported that the pentagon ģenerāinspekcija launched an investigation after the centcom analysts complaints .
pentagon spokesman lieutenant commander patrick evans announced that the pentagon will not comment on the report to congress , while the investigation continues .
he added that experts sometimes different interpetē complex data , and the ministry of defense and intelligence agency calls for a constructive dialogue on a vitally important national security issues .
the investigation does not apply only to the question of whether the american-led the bombing campaign in iraq and syria is successful ( statement , which is increasingly the representatives of the ministry of defence ) .
but last year the prosecution calls into question whether president obama can fully rely on central pārvaldniecības reports on the military operations in iraq , afghanistan and other hotspots .
criticising the islamic state intelligence recalls more than ten years old when the events of centcom intelligence analyst general gregory hūkers published a study claiming that mr george w. bush administration launched the afghanistan war , too little in the way of thinking about the possible consequences .
hūkers also played a significant role in the islamic state intelligence at the opening of the issue .
last year , official representatives of reported that hūkera team revealed that , in contrast to the public reports of air strikes islamic state oil facilities are not significantly worsened the terrorist group &apos;s financial situation , because they had been built temporary factory in order to sell oil on the black market .
the times reported that the september edition of this discovery has come from outside the central pārvaldniecības walls .
the then centcom commander general loids ostins iii , received sharp criticism , because many of the law makers believed that war reports describe the situation too positive .

the period of depression nomācošākais food is &quot; sātīgā &quot; meals
1933 in march , shortly after his election as president of the frenklins delano roosevelt ovālajā withholding room , sat down to a meal .
president rūzveltam it tasted fine culinary delikateses such as goose liver pastēte or fuagrā and maryland turtles soup .
but today his meals were far more modest on small : carrying eggs , potatoes and tomatoes are immersed biezputra desertā - pear pudding .
jane ziegelmane said : &quot; this is a way to show solidarity with the people of gastronomy that times were very hard . &quot;
her husband it kou adds : &quot; it is also a message to the americans , as should eat . &quot;
a couple of brooklyn heights district is food historians .
kou last book &quot; vegetable sautējums &quot; describes the chinese cuisine in america , but ziegelmane in his book &quot; 97 apple &quot; describes life through the dish to rent in manhattan eastern lejasdaļā .
their new joint work &quot; sātīgā meals , &quot; which will be published on tuesday , the publishing house harper , is the story of the american meals during the great depression .
with a degree of solidarity on gastronomy , they had a meal together reporters &quot; eisenberg &apos;s sandwich shop &quot; , in a simple lunch ēstuvē flatironas , which is located in the district and operates from 1929 , at the start of a great depression .
54 years old ziegelmanes president ordered sviestmaizi kausēto sakapātām with cheese and olives and 57 years old kou commissioned a turkey , potatoes and vegetables biezputru salad .
when the reporter was commissioned by counterfeit riders , the couple admitted that his choice is a very appropriate conversation about the great depression time meals .
ziegelmanes president said that the bogus bird was very popular .
there was a peanut the hare , liver bird and beans bird .
they were made from the basic and other ingredients that have enriched the meal .
iedomājies , as it is eaten so much zemesriekstus so that they would have lunch instead .
mr kou novaibstījās .
&quot; i suppose it seemed that the stomach is full of lead , &quot; he added .
pirmsdepresijas years the american dinner table was akin to a swedish table , especially in rural areas .
women are prepared to eat their husbands-workers and for breakfast , lunch and dinner so served fresh made sacepumi .
the first world war , the americans sent directly to the europeans meals . &quot; sātīgā meals &quot; describe how americans pielāgojās circumstances , when america was suddenly no longer the land of plenty .
&quot; at the time , food became the main focus of the popular sites on a daily basis , &quot; says mr kou , explaining why he and his wife wanted to write directly on the subject .
equally important became the new budgetary diet : the unknown dishes as bogus hare and sautējumi became a daily life , sautējumi was &quot; an excellent way to use the leftovers , &quot; noted ziegelmanes president , as chefs could bury nepievilcīgās ingredients below krēmīgas sauces .
svaigos fruit was replaced by cheap žāvētie fruit .
meat , which for years was a key part of the american meals , now became extremely rare luxury goods .
at a time when the number of calories and nutritional value of food was more important than the taste , the birth of the new , even unprecedented arrangements .
how ancient pavārgrāmatā ziegelmanes president found a prescription , and cook with peanut butter pildītus sīpolus .
mr kou added : &quot; this was not a popular addition to the dinner table . &quot;
mrs ziegelmanes said : &quot; it was surreal . &quot;
peanut butter and fish sīpols are not compatible .
many of the homes recipes piemērojās difficult times .
these households economists as in stanley , federal office of the head of household economy from 1923 to ensure no political authority can interfere , noteicas the country &apos;s eating habits , which had not been seen before , not after the great depression .
the publication of stories and recipes in newspapers and magazines , they recommended the housewives to become &quot; ekonomistēm &quot; and to adopt such challenges as into pasta and carrot miksli garšīgā maltītē .
&quot; sātīgā maltīte &quot; is a historic gardumu mielasts .
particularly interesting is evidence of the government &apos;s treatment of its own to hungry citizens , for example , president herberta hūvera &quot; let me eat cake &quot; attitude .
although he spoke publicly about his childhood and simple meals iowa , in fact he ate as a fine millionaire , on which he had become .
mr kou said : &quot; he loved the european cuisine , such as fish with cucumber sauce . &quot;
he ate almost apzeltītā viesistabā , wearing dinner coat .
he was completely detached from reality .
president roosevelt would have made the same mistake , unless his wife eleonora would not recommended him to set an example with his stomach .
the book told that roosevelt nolīdzis domestic workers , who nemācēja prepare to eat , and with it the white house became a place &quot; where not only was presented one of the visnegaršīgākajiem meals in washington , but also the worst pagatavotajiem &quot; .
as soon as the country &apos;s economy atkopās , the majority of the depression era culinary parašas disappeared .
but we continue to focus on the energy and nutritional value , as well as how to apply the science of gastronomy , added ziegelmanes president .
the couple are told that writing the book , they took on a greater understanding of ziegelmanes &apos;s mother eating habits , for example , why she was unable to throw out meals .
&quot; she really was afraid to throw out food , &quot; said mr kou .
mrs ziegelmanes said : &quot; she actually tracināja people . &quot;
once upon a time , was the incident with the wind kūkām .
when we eat eisenberga ēstuvē , writers a couple pulled out of bags at home : either desertu pear &apos; by president roosevelt tend to eat lunch .
&quot; this is a pear putukrējums ziegelmanes , &quot; the president said , adding that at the time was the widespread habit of modest meals to give šiku name .
it is not only putukrējuma , prunes , a bit of flour , sugar , water and kanēlis .
all the impatient trieca bitterness brūnajā tangled , located on the plates .
surprisingly , it was not so bad .
mr kou apēda a few .
izklausoties after a sophisticated &quot; economist wife &quot; , he said : &quot; we could šķipsniņa samaltu hazelnut . &quot;

stratforda and Īstenda won an awful lot of the olympic games .
and we will do it again , with local people and companies with business opportunities near heathrow .
local komūnām alone we will create 10,000 new business opportunities , 40 000 new jobs and finally put a stop to youth unemployment at heathrow in the vicinity .
just as it was at the london olympic games in 2012 , and this time there will be people who will argue that this challenge is too high and that the expansion of heathrow is too ambitious .
people said that britain will never fail to prepare for the olympic games , and that it will be a global failure .
the sceptics wrong for 2012 and also the heathrow case , they will not be true .
there are always obstacles to be overcome , but heathrow so far has overcome everything .
like the olympics , heathrow is infrastructure project , which will benefit the whole of society , rather than individuals .
enlargement is the opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs , economic growth 211 billion , creating the soil and employment , and experience in the airport and across britain .
heathrow , we have an excellent team , which has led to 11 billion pounds &apos; worth of infrastructure investment programme , which falls within the time limit and budget from the terminal 5 , which five years from the site has been named the best airport terminal in the world and finally with terminal 2 , which is built between two more intensively used skrejceļiem in the world .
now they are ready for a third runway , which will be funded with private investment 16 billion pounds per year .
in the 2012 london olympic games was a great success and i am sure that will also be the heathrow expansion .
the time has come for us to revive the olympic spirit and to expand heathrow , ensuring the future of our trade and creating a new environment with employment , with which britain can be proud of .

atv programme &quot; 4.studija &quot; turned dmitry saidjaševs which neighbour started kapitālo repair in his apartment , and since then , dmitri from the ceiling was drūp and not of the belief that it is safe to stay in the apartment .
the problem is that my neighbours carried out arbitrary construction and in my apartment is damaged ceiling .
then i informed the riga būvvaldi , house managers and other organisations .
būvvalde said that we are not a call centre and we have no expert .
&quot; dzīvokļa owner has to go in latvia &apos;s chief ally , and from there will be an expert , &quot; says dmitry .
fiksējis regionirancountry pieaicinātais expert arrived , and admitted that pārsegums was unsatisfactory condition .
however , since the first dmitry application būvvaldē a month , and by the beginning of this week it and no one was unable to answer , or the location of the apartment is not life .
būvvaldē said - that is the law , allowing several , if you are not satisfied , contact all in a row .
&quot; then i wrote to the riga city council , but they forwarded the house manager , then back to the house manager būvvaldi and there is a stalemate , &quot; says dmitry .
after all , the pile of paper , it is clear that the works had been suspended , while every time to hear that someone can work there .
just two months , is said to have carried out the expertise and within six months , the owner of the apartment , which carries out repairs , all these defects were removed .

as long as is expected of the expert &apos;s opinion , būvvalde decided that the two apartments may not operate - and that is in the works , and dmitry flat .
&quot; this is in practice būvvaldes unprecedented in this way their ignorance or simply because of the reluctance of people , perhaps , created a threat not only in its possession , but also at the bottom of the property owner , as a result of which the owner cannot operate their own property , &quot; says spokeswoman būvvaldes .
now dmitri left to look for another place to live - to relatives , friends , in a hotel or rent another apartment .
but the losses incurred by dmitry may try to recover from a neighbour &apos;s civil round , which can take a lot of time .
patvaļīgās the construction of two apartments to stay at the moment is forbidden , to engineer will give its verdict , and it may have to wait up to three weeks .
the losses will be borne by the owner of the apartment , which underwent repairs .
this apartment owner because būvvaldes said , has not taken into account , is also in prison for up to six months .

nasa climate model : venēra had been an inhabitable planet
nasa on the basis of the latest climate models , venēra has ever been an inhabitable planet .
of nasa &apos;s goddard institute for space studies scientists have developed a model to explore venus history , using tools and algorithms , which is also used by climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine whether the surface of venus , which is hot on the water and its atmosphere is made up almost exclusively of carbon , has ever been the earth to similar conditions .
scientists have previously have raised speculation that venus slow turning speed is due to solid atmosphere .
but the latest simulations show that on venus had been a similar plan , the earth and its atmosphere griezusies slowly .
the model also looks at the venus earlier topography .
the planet has been more dry areas than on earth , but they had enough water and geographical diversity , that could lead to life and prevent the water to evaporate .
early venus times the sun was about 30 per cent spožāka .
giss model of bolzano venus turning model reveals that a good part of the day for the last 2 months , the press release said giss scientist anthony del genio .
this process heat the planet &apos;s surface and causes the case , which in turn is made up of thick cloud layers , which acts as an umbrella , protecting the planet from the solar heat .
the result is a moderate climate temperature , which is , in fact , a few degrees lower than the temperature of the earth today .
the model captures venus history , which is similar to the theory of evolution , which in their hipotēzēs developed by scientists .
although once it has been an inhabitable , several billion years venēra been exposed to too many hot and ultravioletajime rays .
its oceans and izgaroja garaiņus izdedzināja ultravioletie on them .
water fully izgarojot , the pair remained only plan of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere with deadly greenhouse gas - venēra as we know it today .
scientists published a new venus climate model results in the journal geophysical research letters .

keplers size stars turning speeds plejādes zvaigznājā .
the latest keplera telescope mission has helped astronomers with to collect the most comprehensive catalogue of stars turning speeds plejādes zvaigznājā .
the new data helps astronomers with understand why stars in this zvaigznājā griežās at different speeds , as well as the way in which stars turning speeds reached the planet formation .
&quot; we hope that the comparison of our results with other zvaigznājiem , we will get more knowledge of the relationship between the mass of the stars , age and even the history of the solar system , &quot; said caltech edition pasadenas infrasarkano the process and analytical center researcher luisa rebula .
plejādes zvaigznājs in 445 light years away from earth .
many of the stars in this zvaigznājā just starting to rise , reaching around 125 million years old .
they moves with the maximum speed .
griežoties with a maximum speed of these rising stars emit large amounts of stars in the wind .
vējiem entering stars magnētiskajā in the field , they have to slow down the stars .
zvaigznēm as they get older , turning superhighway .
keplers measured each stars turning speeds measured the time between the recognisable stars in the area , such as the sun , the emergence of slick .
the latest stars turning on the speed of the catalogue shows that more stars moves more slowly than smaller stars .
rebuls compares the stars with dejotajiem , greater man dancers perform piruetes more slowly than the small man dancers .
rebuls baletā plejādes &quot; tells us that &quot; we can see that slowly revolving facilities are bigger and faster , while masīvāki revolving facilities are very small stars .
thanks to the fact that plejādes zvaigznājs are so close , it serves as a great space laboratory , where the stars to compare the performance of turning speeds .
rebuls plejādes zvaigznājs story that helps to create a theoretical models of stars rotated in both directions both older and younger stars .
we still have a lot to learn about how , when and why would slow down the speed of stars and turning on their full stop the process .
rebuls and his colleagues detailed introduced the plejādes stars turning speed analysis of the three new publications , which will soon be published astronomijas Žurnālā .
