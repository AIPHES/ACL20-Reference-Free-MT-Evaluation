the new doctor strike : calls for new protests
the new physician representatives request its trade unions to launch protests in the dispute about the new contract .
the british medical association ( lma ) , the new doctor ( jacket ) is going to require the council to support the wider protests in early september .
jake believes that ministers failed to dispel doubts about the treaty .
in july , young doctors and medical students rejected the proposed agreement lma .
against the treaty voted 58 % of all members who participated in the vote .
thursday night the published message twitter board member ellen jacket makkort indicates that the government continue to remain silent on the matter and therefore the contract offer is rejected .
she said : &quot; in view of this , the results of the contract vote jacket offer is completely rejected and the decision to require new formal negotiations to discuss the key issues . &quot;

russia and turkey : excluded an alliance ?
the gesture , which ended the crisis .
the russian and turkish leaders met tuesday to shake hands and tell about eight months of word and economic sanctions in the end of the war .
vladimir putin in greeting him , however with the turkish leader in the st. petersburg palace , got the impression that this partnership more needed for ankara .
however , the two shook hands .
vladimir putin &apos;s smile looked stilted and caused the warm emotions , even considering his usual reticence .
recep tayyip erdogan , by contrast , is at least five times called putin for his &quot; dear friend &quot; , reads the appointment overview .
i failed number .
he also promised that relations with russia not only will improve to the pre-crisis level , but will become even stronger .
the next day , a newspaper reported that erdogan has behaved as though nothing had happened .
in my opinion , his enthusiasm causes conflicting feelings .
but the coolness of putin &apos;s radiant suggests that the russian leader had not forgotten .
one of the first things he mentioned in his speech , was a russian aircraft notriekšan on the syrian border .
back then moscow reacted harshly .
putin accused the ankara that it too the dagger back in moscow .
resentment was even more painful considering that it came from a friend &apos;s party .
restore true confidence will be very difficult , perhaps even impossible .
since november the russian public position is changed .
for several months the government-controlled television released the aggressive insults against ankara .
suddenly it seemed that all was to blame the turks .
the most serious was the accusation that erdogan &apos;s own family made profits from illegal oil trade with the islamic state controlled syria .
he , of course , denied .
but the st. petersburg meeting key message that it &apos;s time to forget the past .
ultimately this meeting happened only because putin received a presidential apology of erdogan .
russia could be seen as a kind of victory .
ankara the benefit of peace settlement is evident .
first , erdogan has needed all possible friends after a failed coup last month , in which he tried to overthrow .
also the countless terrorist attacks have shattered his position .
it is also economic motives .
the russian sanctions have caused massive damage , particularly the charter prohibition , usually each year provides several million russian tourists influx of turkish resorts .
the number of tourists dropped by almost 90 % .
the russian web and čarterkompānij relief uzelpo when the regular flights will be restored .
they hope to leave the mediterranean fever season ended .
this week national tv made for fruit and vegetable prices , as will revert to turkey &apos;s fruit and vegetable imports .
as quoted by the local newspaper vedemost : &quot; tourists , their tomatoes for us . &quot;
but the visit also had other political motives from moscow .
ankara is angry about the west they think a weak reaction to the coup attempt .
you can also watch all the frustrations with the ieilgušaj negotiations on accession to the eu and putin &apos;s intervention , who prefer to use a situation that turkey atsvešinājus from the west .
the russian leader undoubtedly got bonus points ankara eyes , expressing its support for the government elected after the coup attempt .
note that moscow understands it , since she has a deep-seated fear of regime change in the country .
the summit , which took place in the plush seaside palace , gave russia and turkey the opportunity to present , as one analyst called it &quot; marginalised the alliance &quot; , the two countries that feel excluded from the west , join forces .
but despite the public show of unity , the two countries still exist considerable differences of opinion .
the main disagreement concerns syria which russia presents itself as a peacemaker , but russia and turkey actually supports the opposite side .
after more than three hours past the original negotiations , not wanting to disclose information , the two presidents announced at a press conference that they have not had this issue .
turkish president purposefully avoided questions about dissent from both countries , while president putin wanted to stress them .
there is no clear consensus about how the two countries could find common ground in the syrian issue .
but after months of openly hostile relations and potential disaster when nato member turkey was hit by a russian combat aircraft , the situation has improved because the two leaders at least commence negotiations .
royal bank of scotland will no longer be available to customers outside scotland
the brand will be supported in the future role of the skb , announced the bank &apos;s executive director .
skb outside scotland will no longer be available .
ross makevan tells the bbc channel in scotland that skb brand was associated with the bank &apos;s global ambitions .
it has abandoned these ambitions because eight years ago the bank almost went bankrupt , and it was the need of financial help .
meanwhile , the zīmolvedīb strategies experts have used the skb brand to protect other consumer finance brand .
the bank received a million pounds from the international sports sponsors , starting with the six nations rugby and finally with the wimbledon tennis champion andy murray a .
but now it has been decided to put at the forefront of other national brands .
the scottish royal banak will be available to customers in scotland , but it will not be initialized .
in england and wales all skb references outside the main office and the official list of the stock exchange , will be replaced on the name natwest .
the republic of ireland and northern ireland is already using the brand the ulster bank .
now attention will also lower private financial brands such as coutts , adam and co , drummond &amp; holt &apos;s military bank .
makevan was interviewed during a road trip with your customers and employees through invernesšīr .
he told bbc scotland : for the channel &quot; will become our investor skb brand and work our employees , because now we &apos;re becoming more of a brand bank . &quot;
by the time the bank itself became a global brand and skb became a global brand .
now i say that we no longer have global ambitions , we have local ambitions .
each of these brands represent something unique in its sector , and our staff will work with clients under these brands .
skb has already announced that it does not continue the &quot; six nations &quot; sponsorship and involve different brands in sports sponsorship .
&quot; it &apos;s the right time to become a brand bank , because we already have asked yourself the question , how to become the best bank for your clients ? &quot; says executive director .
three years ago it would have been very cynical if we let that become a great bank for our clients and develop these brands .
but thanks to hard work and a focus on customer needs , not our own needs , we obviously have made big changes .
we can once again to revive the brand , so i think now is the right time .

russian president putin dismissed the head of the administration of sergey ivanov
russian president vladimir putin unexpectedly dismissed the head of the administration , sergey ivanov .
ivanov was for many years the closest people in putin &apos;s circle .
currently , the 63-year-old politician has been appointed as the special representative nature and transport issues .
the kremlin statement said that putin &quot; has decided to release ivanov from russia &apos;s presidential administration manager job duties &quot; , without giving any reason .
ivanova site post appointed anton blame , who had been his deputy since 2012 .
44 year-old blames the diplomat is thrilled .
blame was born in 1972 in the estonian capital tallinn , graduated from the prestigious moscow state institute of international relations ( mvs ) , and later worked in the tokyo embassy .
as says the kremlin &apos;s homepage ( in russian ) , he later headed the presidential protocol and government workers are managed .
after the appointment , putin said he : &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot;
in my opinion , the administration &apos;s main job is to support your work in the office of the president , the developing law and controlling your decision .
putin on friday told a russian broadcaster that ivanov himself wanted to leave the post and recommend the blame as his substitute .
or convince a smile ?
this step only in moscow .
sergei ivanov has a long and close to vladimir putin &apos;s ally and , like putin , had once worked for the soviet kgb security service .
in this capacity , he was one of the most influential men in russia .
national television broadcast the meeting , the two men announced that ivanov resigns on his own initiative .
but despite the cameras focus smiles , rarely that this explanation make sure , especially before elections .
or it is related to the outcome of the fight for power ?
no one knows it .
but the official statement that the man , who was seen as a possible president , suddenly he wants to become the head of russia &apos;s environmental policy , is perceived with great skepticism .
the kremlin website posted notes ivanov says putin : &quot; it is a fact that at the beginning of 2012 , i beg of you i entrust this difficult position , one might even say , problematic posts , four years .
it turns out that i &apos;ve worked in this position for four years and eight months .
ivanov took office in december 2011 .
he was previously prime minister and defense minister .
he is a member of the russian security council and former kgb state security service employees , like putin .
at the end of the 1990s , putin headed the federal security service , which is the kgb successor , ivanov took the post of deputy .
when putin came to power , he named ivanov to five the number of people whom he trusts most .
putin &apos;s second term the end ivanov was considered a potential candidate for the post of president of russia , as putin &apos;s reelection to a third term would be unconstitutional .
but back then as president became another close ally putin-dmitry medvedev .
putin became prime minister , and after three and a half years returned to the presidential office .

engineers have been kvīnsferij the savienojuš intersection in the northern part and the viaduct , which means that the bridge is now connected to faif .
the first of the four connecting parts have been completed , which means that the construction of the bridge is coming to a close .

it consists of 10 000 tonnes of steel , 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 support cables .
currently 1.35 billion pounds &apos; worth of projects scheduled for completion in may 2017 .
economic secretary kate brown today had come to the construction site and was one of the first who climbed up onto the bridge .
he said : &quot; this is a symbolic and historic moment kvīnsferij bridge construction . &quot;
in this project we see unparalleled engineering solution , which only this part of the building uses more than 30 000 tonnes of cement and steel .
despite the bridge the huge weight and size , the bridge and the viaduct connecting is an extremely delicate process that requires immense precision .
overall , more than 79 % of the bridge deck already built and the last link that will connect the bridge with rosita will be laid today , which means that all the parts of the bridge are ready for decking .
the fourth bridge connecting project director michael martin tells the story : &quot; the first connection is a very important point in the construction of any bridge . &quot;
this fantastic project first connection exhibit a higher-end civil engineering .
after the last section of the road connecting with the setup and the north tower &apos;s support , we could connect the northern leg of the land part or the viaduct .
this was done by moving the north driveway part of 700 millimetres in the viaduct to the south .
it was huge and at the same time very delicate operation .
huge because the viaduct is 222 meters long , weighs about 6000 tons and had to angle pulling around 3 % .
tricky , because tolerance in both directions , with what worked in the team , was only a few millimetres .
luckily , it worked well .

why we need simon , gabij and laurij ?
i called it for a year in the women &apos;s olympic athletics team for several reasons .
first , i &apos;ve been to all summer olympics since 1984 , and the u.s. team has never been so good .
secondly , this command has three athletes , simon bails , gabij of the douglas and laurij hernandez , which inspires many of the new girl &apos;s origin .
people can be proud that this team also is allie raisman , who is jewish and madison kocian , who is catholic .
finally , this team truly representative of the united states .
it has also strengthened its black and latin american athletes participating in this sport .
over the past four years the best gymnast is african american .
last year simon and gabij took 1st and 2nd place .
these are impressive results .
previous olympics gabij douglas surprisingly became the olympic champion , and america was a real treat .
now the world has seen unreliable exercise , which fulfilled the triple world champion simon bails , douglas and laurij hernandez of the unprecedented but masterly in the exercise .
simon on thursday became the fourth american in a row , which has won the gold medal in the individual all-round competition for women .
her team colleague allie raisman got the silver medal .
we &apos;ve seen the best that this sport can give , but the rest of the country the situation is gym class , totally different .
simon , gabij and the laurij made the olympics team as allie and madison .
they are the &quot; olympic top five &quot; because the next olympic gymnastic team will have only four athletes , and this is a coach &apos;s march of the last year of the coach karol .
actually gymnastics is an expensive sport . gymnasts train mainly in private clubs , athletics , and maintain them , parents who pay for the workouts , rooms , travel , uniforms , hotel ( coaches , athletes and their families ) , and other expenses .
most of these athletics club located in urban areas that can afford this sport .
these clubs athletes spend all his workouts , and it is an expensive and long contribution to athlete families .
amy būrman-simon bails of coaches and maggie hainij-laurij of trenējuš of hernandez &apos;s coach their athletes from the two girls began to deal with the athletics .
we must ensure that young girls that inspired simon , gabij , and laurij , a cheaper gym workout facilities .
i founded my own athletics organization 20 years ago .
my organizācijaatrod in haarlem , and we offer more than 15 000 cities young people ( mainly black and spanish origin ) gym workouts for free or for a low price . we have also trenējuš national and international champions .
in september we find the affiliate in detroit ( my hometown ) to provide local young people the chance to get to know this great sport .
athletics develops strength , coordination , and body lokanum , as well as learn the hard work , discipline and desire to target .
this combination ensures a long life with good health and success both in school and at work .
this command will inspire thousands of young girls practicing athletics , and it &apos;s fantastic .
to engage in this sport are very important , especially for young girls .
this is a very exciting time .
thanks simon , allie , gabij and madison for the excellent &quot; power girls &quot; demo to get the olympic gold medals and motivating countless new , girls of different origins to become a healthy , strong and successful young women .
by jeremy hunt , the new supply rejection , doctors plan to extract more strikes .
the ministers hoped to end the dispute by way of changes to the contract with the british medical association representatives . but it was rejected by 58 percent from 37 000 new doctors who participated in the vote .
in july , hunt announced plans to conclude the contract , stating that the nhs is in stable condition and further delays only hurt employees and patients .
the first new doctors already have signed a new contract that provides for changes in the conditions of work night shifts and weekends to improve working conditions of non-standard working hours .
last night the new bma doctors &apos; spokeswoman dr. ellen makourt said that young doctors still has serious concerns about the proposed agreement , in particular that it will deepen the crisis in the labour force , and it does not provide equal conditions for all doctors .
eight weeks remaining until the first new physician group will sign a new contract , so the progress , because time is running out .
bma &apos;s efforts to solve the problem through negotiation is faced with the government &apos;s reluctance to get involved and sometimes with complete silence .
this happened despite the fact that late last month , jeremy hunt said that his door is always open .
jeremy hunt has to act immediately , stop the inaction and cooperate with new doctors .
if he will not , then the new doctors are ready for new protests .
during the last strike in late april was postponed more than 13 000 and 100 000 visits , routine operations , while nurses and consultants were trying to replace doctors who had gone out pickets .
the ministers hoped to end the dispute by way of changes to the contract with the british medical association representatives .
bma wishes to raise the rate for weekend work 54 000 young doctors , which would apply to new contracts .
nhs employment executive director daniel mortimer urged doctors not to give the new strikes .
mr. mortimer explains that the strikes will not solve anything , but only increases the pressure on busy workers and worry , cause stress and obstacles patients , caregivers and their families .
in the last two months we have spoken with the new doctor , and together with the health ministry and other institutions have responded positively to their questions about choice and the rapporteur .
employers hope that active cooperation on other important issues , such as the deployment of employees , flexible training , additional training for those who return after a career break , training costs , training programs for mutual recognition , leaving and gender pay inequality in medicine-show that employers , england , health education authority , and the ministry of health seriously wants to realize the agreements concluded with the bme in november , february and may .
medicine for 2 pounds a day can reduce the risk of heart attack .
thousands of patients who have had a heart attack , could be treated with medicine for 2 pounds a day , because the official representatives to use them more recommended for people and for a longer period of time .
pretrecēšan drug ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeat heart attacks for people with cardiovascular .
this medicine is prescribed for use in 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of repeated heart attacks .
the nhs represented nice recommends to use this preparation for 4 years after a heart attack , to further reduce the risk of heart attack for people with cardiovascular problems .
but at the moment the nhs held nice to use this preparation recommended for 4 years after a heart attack , to further reduce cardiovascular risk .
each year , approximately 140 000 people in england are experiencing a heart attack , and a quarter of them experiencing recurrent heart attack or stroke .
heart attack and stroke due to fat accumulation in the heart wall , creating a blockage .
if the obstruction to tear , it can cause clotting , blocking blood flow to the heart and cause a heart attack .
however , if the clot removed from the walls of the blood vessels , it can get into the bloodstream and block further blood access to the brain , causing a stroke .
people who have had a heart attack , are at greater risk of heart attack for reuse .
ticagrelor , manufactured by the british firm astrazeneca and marketed under the name briliqu , reduces the risk of thrombus formation .
the new nice guidelines , which was published today , recommends people use 90 mg ticagrelor 12 months and another 3 years to 60 mg twice a day in combination with aspirin .
nice health technology director professor carole longson explains : &quot; despite the fact that drugs are available for the prevention of heart attack again , more than a quarter of people who have had a heart attack , experiencing another heart attack or stroke , which often have heavy consequences . &quot;
fear of repeating a heart attack can leave a negative impact on people &apos;s quality of life .
the evidence shows that , in combination with aspirin ticagrelor effectively reduce repeated heart attacks and stroke risk for people who have already experienced it once .
provisionally suggesting treatment with ticagrelor , are glad that we can expand the treatment options so that thousands of people are winners .
in view of the limited information about the effectiveness and safety of ticagrelor , especially bleeding risk when using this medication for more than three years ago , the draft guidelines do not recommend their use for longer than this period .
political correctness culture promotes fraud during elections in muslim communities
under the management of former tauerhamlet the report mayor lutfur rahman was fired in from office in connection with corruption .
a government report found that political correctness is conserving cultural eyes to large-scale cheating muslim communities .
former government minister sir eric pikl criticizes police , election supervisors and the city council that they ignore the signs of fraud in the electoral process because &quot; they fear to offend ethnic and religious interests . &quot;
a former community secretary , who has now become the head of the organization against corruption , says that voter intimidation for religious reasons is so commonplace that police should be allowed to deploy guards at polling stations and intimidated voters to protect them .
he also recommends that voters would have to produce identity document when they vote to show their true identity .
now voters must indicate the name and address only .
he even recommended to mark voters fingers provided with special ink to prevent double voting .
the rapporteur must also ensure greater protection , &quot; says sir david .
he believes that the press greater access to council documents and decisions taken by the committee and informal working groups .
he says : &quot; the aim is not only to prevent fraud in the elections , but also to protect local communities from the broader culture of corruption and fraud that goes hand in hand with that . &quot;
the report was commissioned by downing street after a scandal related to the elections of the city of tauerhamlet .
last year the special electoral court decided to cancel the mayor lutfur rahman from the mayor &apos;s office the corrupt and illegal practices .
the court found that rahman &quot; cynically distorted &quot; his muslim community religious views and silenced the critics , his accusing racism and islamofobij .
&quot; rahman led his election campaign with a stance that believers of the muslim religious duty to vote for him . &quot;
about 300 votes were fake or dubious , because one person had voted more than once .
like sir erik indicates that around the country there are signs of fraud .
he pointed out that the particularly disturbing is the fraud in the voting by mail , which the muslim community senior members forced others to vote for the candidates you want .
sir david suggested a number of measures to improve the electoral system , including the presentation of the identity document , to find out the identity of the person .
his message reads : &quot; evidence suggests that a vulnerable ethnic minority community members , particularly women and young people , are forced to vote on community senior chosen candidates , particularly bangladesh and pakistan communities . &quot;
&quot; there is concern that the district authorities not paying attention to these problems , because of political correctness might offend ethnic and sectarian interests . &quot;
sir david outlined the 50 recommendations to improve the electoral system , which also includes a ban on political activists to work with votes cast by post , to prevent the &quot; collection &quot; .
in the message , the teresa may , also called to a more thorough examination of registration in order to prevent the use of the electoral roll for immigration and benefit fraud .
to consider before voting to require voters to show identification .
to mark the fingers of voters voted with special ink to prevent double voting .
systematically examine the person of the nationals , to ensure that the person has the right to vote .
three year limit on requests for automatic postal voting .
prohibit political campaign members and activists working with votes cast by mail and election envelopes for voting by mail .
to ensure the police powers to designate the guard at polling stations .
to make changes to the law to facilitate prosecution of persons on intimidation , in accordance with the human rights act 1983 .
prohibit photographing polling stations .
determine the requirements for polling stations to use english only ( except in wales ) .
to intensify the training to the precinct workers ensure that voters go to the ballot box one by one .
sir eric sharply criticise the metropolitan police , expressing dismay that the tauerhamlet case is set forth in the indictment .
he says : &quot; only the electoral court of diskvalificēj luftur rahman and his deputy for operations connected with corruption and cheating . &quot;
he surely was found guilty by the criminal law standard of proof based on conclusive evidence .
he also criticizes the city council not voters &apos; ticks check &quot; voter registration stations .
sir eric : &quot; last year in the court &apos;s decision is an alarm bell .
our earth is known as the birthplace of the parliament , but the alarming and hidden election fraud and spoofing of the institutions that fraud occurs to this good reputation .

how to protect themselves from firearms , using krav maga
the world is a dangerous place , but this video of dailymail.com can make it much safer .
to find out how to protect themselves in the near distance of the attackers with a firearm , we talked with krav maga from the new york grandmaster ron mizrak .
regardless of whether you are attacked from the front or the back , this video shows you how to protect themselves and to gain the upper hand over the attackers .
mizrak indicate if an attacker attacking from behind , then you must first rotate to clearly see the attacker and avoid the shot trajectory .
then the gun grip between your front arm and shoulder and beats your opponent &apos;s face with his free arm .
then comes the blow with a knee to the groin and while the attacker fell pain , subtract his weapon to hit across the face with the gun handle and withdraw , continuing to turn the gun on him .
if the attacker approaching from the front , the situation is similar-you should avoid the shot trajectory weapon grip and bend it so that the man can not fire .
at the same time putting pressure on the gun and take a blow to an opponent on the chest and finally robbed him the weapon and continued to aim at to resign for him .
sounds complicated ?
watch the video to see how directly do mizrak .
but remember , if you &apos;re not a krav maga master , then it is safer to give away their money to robbers .

the president , who stayed in the shadows : gustav zemgals-to 145 .
friday , august 12 , turns 145 years since born second latvian president gustavs zemgals .
in 1918 he proclaimed the republic of latvia , but undeservedly have remained broadly described the first latvian president john shrike and the pre-war period last president charles k.ulmaņa shade .
no one else from our statesmen are not so much defending democracy and the rule of law as latvia , ten years ago , the iron dedicated to gustav paper written by arnold auziņš .
in conversation with portal &quot; delfi &quot; auziņš stresses that in latvia is one of the few high positions in existing politicians that had a sense of humor .
the rest of the stiff , always very correct .
he could not be , nowadays it might be similar to what is raimond vējonis .
&quot; he was the one , who is close to the people , &quot; telling auziņš .
modern politicians bad know the history , they referred to karl lee as the right leaders , but very few of us know how furious he had .
the only person in the meetings of the government , to which he did not cried out , been a general pigeon .
even if the pictures he is kind and smiling , by nature he was hysterical .
&quot; the iron with his sense of humor and strengthens the democratic nature of the leave exactly the opposite impression , &quot; says auziņš .
university of latvia , faculty of history and philosophy professor aivars stranga &apos;s conversation with &quot; new delhi &quot; agrees with the assessment of auziņ iron as a peaceful and steady statesman .
he also noted that latvia had to respect for minorities , regularly called upon the jewish representatives to the presidential palace .
&quot; at that time it was not customary , after the presidency of latvia albert kviesis took over this tradition &quot; tells a historian .
he was such a quiet and calm man who long had persuaded to become president .
he himself after it was sought , not just wanted fame .
he &apos;s also quite critical of themselves , because the judge did not know french , but considered that it should be the president .
&quot; during the french presidency of the basics and learn &quot; , explains hoffman .
iron will not allow to be persuaded to stand , it really high posts never enjoyed .
in every way he history of latvia is very respectable personality , already before entering the presidential palace was a serious post-he was much in demand for notary .
also , zemgals was led by the famous iron out in the street suvorov ( 3 ) , where the krājamatniek and the krājaizdevēj society , the practical negotiations became the government of latvia .
he always had a progressive minded .
wasn &apos;t a big fan , but public k.ulmaņa him also objected .
&quot; private conversations and is sometimes made that really k.ulmaņa action not simpatiz &quot; , specifies the strange .
lived a peaceful life , there is no suspicion of irregularities or corruption .
as 1918 he remembered today ?
sorry , but for a large part of he were associated with a single street in riga .
he was an absolute democrat , was considered a centrist .
&quot; she was not a big shock , i mean , he could associate with a really stable presidency &quot; , sums up the strange .
gustav zemgals &apos;s presidency , from 1927 to 1930 , was also a latvian state visit to sweden , which latvia has not just meant full recognition of the neighbouring country and into democratic nations of northern europe family .
28 may 1929 in 1918 he arrived on a state visit in stockholm .
the swedish king gustav v &apos;s visit to latvia in response took place june 29 , 1929 .
the second president of latvia born in 1871 , but in eternity went in january 1939 .
simple ways to help her cope with a tantrum .
i am often faced with the fact that the child &apos;s anger , rage at the parents considered something wrong and insane .
when a child openly showing their anger-we do not know how to react , &quot; econe &quot; indicates the cass yekaterina counselor .
expert urges to small talk about these so natural and human feelings-anger and rage , which periodically experiencing each .
aggression-it is already a natural action that addressed against other people , and it usually appears when you feel angry .
when we , the adults , are angry , upset-usually know what is going on with us and how to deal with it .
we &apos;re your anger and rage to yourself we can express , repress , : hidden , keep yourself , tell about it to your friends or other loved ones , we can rage kicking the couch , smoke a cigarette ( it &apos;s not the best way to anger kliedēšan ! ) , shower , hit by kulak on the table and do other things that normally do not do .
we do not draw his aggression against others , because know various other ways to deal with those emotions .
children when they are matched in anger , do not understand what is happening to them , as they call it and how to live with them .
they may say : &quot; go away ! &quot; , you &apos;re a fool &quot; , &quot; bad mom &quot; , &quot; hate you &quot; , &quot; i &apos;m draudzēšo &quot; -and not very rare , when able to say : &quot; i &apos;m mad at you . &quot;
the kids are literally , they fully located right here , at this point , they are spontaneous and true to their feelings , and often also display different emotions .
it is very important that parents not prohibited child expressions of feelings , including anger , shaming or not rāto , but on the contrary-help the child .
or relationships need pauzīt ?
a long work day , in which everything was not exactly the way you like , or just a bad mood-there are so many reasons why would like for a moment , a day or even longer &quot; disabled &quot; from all over the world .
or perhaps for a moment also for iepauzē and a little further tightening ?
or however it shows that each of the partners your way to go ?
their views share the lord in different ages .
john ( 23 ) is a short and concise : &quot; in my view , if necessary , the pauzīt not with real people . &quot;
meanwhile , edward ( 30 ) has discovered the scheme , which perhaps someone can help .
if you feel that your partner starts to fall on you nerves for every smallest detail , then down-this is the moment when you should explore other hunting fields to see if you miss him , especially about her or think , or even not at all want to see him anymore .
so the answer is-yes , pauzīt &apos;s withholding can help save time and understand how important to you is the second pendant .
kevin ( 29 ) revealed his theory .
in my opinion , the relationship of the pauzīt should be withheld from each other everyday , because if you spend time with people 24 hours a day , seven days a week , the controversy is inevitable .
it is caused by the fact that you see every detail of what the other is doing , and it begins to fall .
people are starting to get tired of each other , especially when you don &apos;t even talk about anything anymore , one about what you are doing during the day .
my personal experience is seem to think so , so i passed the relationship more than a few months .
if you got a moment to think about that or other are better elsewhere-so why this woman , together with what i deserved such that you can think of it , there are enough good and behind the hills is a paradise field ?

german researchers discuss the &quot; victims of the berlin wall &quot; .
according to a new study of the number of fatalities at the communist yoke in the former east germany &apos;s former boundaries could be much greater than previously thought , but doubts about the true number of victims is still not clarified .
according to data provided by wednesday &apos;s disclosure of the berlin wall museum at checkpoint charlie , the period from 1945 to 1989 at the border with the western allied zones of west germany and later the communist authorities killed in 1841 the people who tried to get out of their control .
museum with border related deaths studied for years and occasionally adjusts the number of victims .
this year &apos;s list added 11 more deaths , including among the victims including a six year-old boy , who drowned , family , trying to get through the then west germany in czechoslovakia and hungary .
among the new victims of the berlin wall is also the dezertier of the soviet army .
&quot; the final amount of damage inflicted by the communist and socialist double evil , is not yet fully documented &quot; , admits the museum director alexander hildebrant .
&quot; our task is to ensure that the graves of people who died trying to escape from communist-controlled country , are maintained and not perish &quot; , stressed the common communication hildebrant .
but other researchers new numbers already debated .
&quot; the figure is not persuasive in 1841 &quot; , in an interview with the newspaper süddeutsch zeitung claims the free university of berlin the east german history expert of Štāt johen .
he , along with other berlin free university researchers now report possible suspicious deaths at the border , and so far they have managed to approve only 260 cases .
previously , the researchers estimated that only at the fall of the berlin wall the communists killed 138 people .
in view of those people who died trying to escape across the baltic sea or to get to the west through neighbouring territory , after Štāt , the number of victims could reach around a thousand .
but it &apos;s still significantly smaller than 1841 .
one of the differences in the number of victims could be the reason for the differing methodologies .
checkpoint charlie museum lists all east german border guards suicide cases , whether or not they were directly related to their service .
the museum also lists the deaths that are not related to direct violence .
&quot; if seniors aged 70 to 80 years after the contractions with the border died of a heart attack &quot; , it must be in the &quot; murderous &quot; consequences , considers hildebrant .
but Štāt is sure that the distinction should be made between the old folks who probably died of their experience in handling and those whose death caused by prolonged hot weather waiting in the bus at the border .
regardless of the victims &apos; records is tricky because the communist east german authorities did not accumulate the following statistical data , and researchers in the various documents must be izvēt scatter archives , indicate Štāt .
however , the Štāt team recently found new documents , and so soon it might come up with a new estimate of the number of victims .

the last days of the sad fame of winning latvia &apos;s swimming federation ( lpf ) president kevin pon of the rio de janeiro olympic games arrived with trainer accreditation , however , even feel surprised about it .
wednesday wide buzz caused by olympic swimmers of the trainer of alyona ribakov is the jakubovsk pronouncements , a german who discovered that at the last moment to rio de janeiro decided to go pon while coach should stay home .

the swimming federation of latvia in the olympics made the five participants , and another in vrubļevsk aldona before departure claimed that the german will have and he searches for tickets .

at the request of the federation uvj coach took to help her .
pon , who is a member of the executive committee of the arc , criticized the action of the fault loop short stories on olympic sports organisations the monitoring trustee .
in my view , is unethical in the executive committee approve a circle of five persons , and one of them not to take .
&quot; don &apos;t know why swimming federation for lack of available &quot; , deplored that the company pon is not assessed and the president of the federation &apos;s work , recalling that the president of the federation do not receive salaries .
also , the same jakubovsk criticised the pon , expressing that before the london olympics , when no approved ribakov between parties , he addressed a complaint to the international water sports federation ( fina ) and urged latvia not to send any athletes .
pon and could not tell you why he is the olympic games with the trainer accreditation , which most likely was to be entitled jakubovsk .
&quot; i was logged in as the president of the federation ( &quot; team leader &quot; ) , but for reasons unknown , received the coach accreditation and is not now . &quot;
the situation changed daily , change the number of accreditation available .
until the last moment think that german will be because other information i had .
after the agency &apos;s information counter , a couple of days before the start of ribakov she had a conversation face-to-face with pon and its swimmers had been with tears in her eyes , however the same lpf president expressed that it was a casual conversation with a desire to put the athletes before the start .
pon is reminded that the lpf oversees five sports , which is in four olympics , and of those going on training children in latvia .
the federation &apos;s president said latvia is very important and also about drowning the programs he talked , in rio de janeiro while in nearly two weeks .
he praised the work of the federation and said that latvia in 2018 could unfold in the world cup .
location of rio de janeiro is not my vacation , here , wasting my time and try to realize the program of četrgad .

i had bladder cancer , which is one of those that can operate and what happened .
if it did , it spread all over the body .
and the situation could become uncontrollable .
it &apos;s a little change in your vision .
williams cancer discovered in december 2013 .
this trio was lucky that william could begin the recovery procedure 2014 at the beginning of the shoulder season and reduce the duration of interruptions to a minimum , if it can be said .
i needed income , therefore i had to recover quickly .
it stimulated to recover .
i was in hospital and i went for 6 , 10 and 15 metres long distance , although the doctor said that would be enough with a few steps .
it all started .
rowing is a challenge in itself , but this time it was even higher .

we made a good start , but at the same time , we had high expectations .
that day we had no intention to overthrow the records , but just the right paddle and win the race and we did it .

among the leaders of the koļegov post &quot; will drive to the last &quot; .
according to him , the prime minister now max kučinsk ( greens and farmers union ) and minister of finance dan reizniec-for oak ( greens and farmers union ) is already a &quot; fundamentally important &quot; to head the environment approved the minister of finance directed the candidates koļegov .
rajevskis estimated that both the kučinsk and the reizniec-oak in the government environment manager approval is &quot; the first big decision &quot; that could affect their future as politicians .

in spain the deficit reduction possibilities was not able to create a threat to the government .
a month ago , on july 12 , the european commission ( ec ) came up with the opinion that spain and portugal are not large enough to consider measures to reduce the budget deficit to the level required by the eurozone &apos;s 3 % of gross domestic product ( gdp ) .
calculations show that despite the austerity measures implemented by the portuguese budget deficit at the end of last year was 4.4 % of gdp , while spain-5.1 % .
however , the european commission decided not to apply the two countries economic sanctions while setting fiscal targets both the nearest time .
one of the reasons why the ec does not , however , imposed sanctions against the two countries , is growing euro scepticism did in many countries of the european union .
additional sanctions such negative sentiment only bolstered .
critics and noted that ec is not consistent in its decisions , first by agreeing to uniform rules and then not being able to apply them in life .
so , for example , germany &apos;s bundesbank president , jens veidmann pointed out that europe is losing confidence in themselves as such , creating a public perception that the rules of the european union is permissive , not binding .
the ec now proposed and accepted by all member states to extend the budget deficit to settle this year for portugal and up to 2018 to spain .
the european commission promises in the next few months to examine the progress of the two countries , while noting that both spain and portugal must be ready to implement additional conservation measures , if required by circumstances .
initial projections show that portugal goal could fail to achieve the prescribed time , and if the budget deficit this year would be reduced to 2.5 % of the gross domestic product .
this means that the stability programme , the government this year is to implement austerity measures to 0.25 % of gdp .
these measures should be included in this year &apos;s budget , additional attention to purchases of goods and services to control costs .
in the case of spain the situation is much more complex .
this year , the budget deficit must be reduced to 4.6 % , 3.1 % and next year – until 2018-up to 2.2 % of gdp .
in addition , following two years of consolidation measures every year should be 0.5 % of gdp .
especially difficult to achieve these objectives , making the fact that for eight months in spain &apos;s political parties failed to agree on the establishment of the government , and increasingly becomes a chance that spain may have to for the third time in a year to hold early parliamentary elections .
but opinion polls show that a third election political scene of the country did not substantially change .
the most popular party is still the current prime minister mariano rahoj-led people &apos;s party , which again get a full 33 % of the vote .
its popularity is only slightly related , while the socialists against the austerity measures the mood of the party &quot; podemo &quot; or &quot; together we can &quot; and &quot; ciudadano &quot; or &quot; citizens &apos; popularity has somewhat lessened .
the people &apos;s party wants to achieve a socialist and &quot; ciudadano &quot; involvement in the government late this month , otherwise will not succeed until mid-october to accept and submit to the european commission for approval of the draft budget by 2017 .
as announced by the people &apos;s party parliamentary group spokesman rafael hernand , if governments create will fail and elections will be held , however , also for the third time , spain will become a fool all over europe .
the cleanliness of the beaches in the gulf of riga is critical .
fifth year surveying beaches , activists found that unfortunately grows each year the number of found garbage , and here the most perfect bathing visitors .
the most polluted bathing areas are directly in riga .
capital city council explains that bathing every day being cleaned up , but fight the slovenly visitors is quite difficult .
in addition , shore leave waste in rainfall can be ieskalot in the water , thus far the pabojāj quality .
except for baltimore , the beach and the place of the individual in kurzeme , the cleanliness of the beaches elsewhere in latvia is critical .
the following statement this week spread into the campaign &quot; my sea &quot; volunteers .
fifth year come a long way on foot gulf of riga , activists found that residents leave the number of waste every hundred meters has been increased .
unfortunately , this year it &apos;s criticality ratings have fallen .
&quot; we see that this will be the year when the number of garbage on a beach 100 meters , might even exceed 200 units , &quot; says expedition &quot; my sea &quot; representative john ulm .
the latvian radio , he was called tūj beach , where volunteers walk along the gulf of riga .
this year , between the different municipal waste and a picnic of the activists came to collect even fluorescent lights that are left lying in the sand of the sea .
a member of the expedition and the organizer of the pollution blamed in ulm said , directly to the population .
&quot; the main source is the same beach visitors , more than half of the total number of waste is plastic , various waste , starting with the bags , the plastic pieces that are already in the stage of degradation , they no longer can be identified , and butts , bottles , corks , &quot; a story of ulm .
among the cleanest beaches bathing is also in riga .
for example , in every hundred brody meters on average collected nearly 800 items of waste , which is critical to many .
campaign organizers also explains that nearly every step bouncing butts and not everywhere well placed warning or signs .
&quot; the average figures for all three bathing together in riga-brody , vakarbuļļ and vecāķ-unfortunately , meet big and far exceed the desired or target , that as latvia moves until 2020 to reduce the number of units of waste up to 135 units &quot; , concludes environmental defender .
bathing cleaning in riga to be every day , even in the hottest days of the summer twice , council representative uģis mocs .
however , the battle with slovenly visitors is quite difficult .
we return to this question of human culture .
&quot; for those who dare , drink alcohol , smoke and do all those things that may not even special characters not exposed &quot; , specifies the mocs .
therefore , the mocs invites visitors to report on bathing polluters also police .
you can call the police , safe to point out these abuses and that way all the fight .
maybe you can put any new warnings , but , as i said , it &apos;s hardly as radically changed the situation .
&quot; whereas all together just to go and be impatient against such violators , &quot; he stressed .
meanwhile , water quality measurements for the fourth time this summer conducted a health inspection , which can impose a prohibition on the official bathing areas .
this year though , like other years , water quality everywhere are good and satisfactory .
now the situation is such that all 56 of the bathing water quality has been good and there is no swimming .
&quot; the last time we &apos;ll have analysis at the end of august &quot; , expresses the inspection senior technician environmental health normunds cade .
strong rainfall on land left in the waste water can be ieskalot .
this in turn can affect the quality , indicate environmental specialist .
the rotation continues in the russian elite-putin administration manager .
even left the posts ?
vladimir putin told russian media that sergei ivanov to leave this post and wanted to continue to be the special representative of the president of nature protection , ecological and transport issues .
announcing the changes , putin in front of television cameras gave ivanov welcome words : &quot; dear sergey borisovič , we are with you for many years working together and doing it successfully . &quot;
i am pleased with how you perform your assigned duties .
i well remember our agreement not to use you in this presidential administration manager for more than four years .
therefore , i am sympathetic to your desire to change the scope .
and i hope that the new post you will make full use of their knowledge and experience .
however , it emphasizes that the presidential administration management is a very important position , and it made the ivanov as one of the most influential people in the country .
considering that russia expected next month &apos;s state elections , aired rumors that this step related to the struggle for power in the political elite of russia .
ivanov was also known as a possible replacement for putin &apos;s presidential post , so the claim that he himself wanted to occupy the post of the representative of the president of nature protection and transport , caused the doubt .
as the lsm.lv archive , ivanov is the kgb and federal security service ģenerālpulkved .
ivanov has been long and close to russian president vladimir putin &apos;s ally .
he specdienesto my life began in 1975 , where she met putin .
later , putin to becoming the head of the federal security service , ivanov became his deputy .
in turn , the first russian president boris yeltsin at the end of his reign , was appointed as secretary of the russian security council .
in the year 2000 after putin &apos;s rise to power was confirmed ivanova developed &quot; information security doctrine &quot; , including in russia envisioned state censorship mechanism in revitalisation .
in 2001 sergei ivanov became russia &apos;s defence minister , but already in 2005 , prime minister mikhail fradkov--on a deputy and was in charge of the russian defence industry and arms exports .
now , after the presidential administration head post , ivanov also keep leaving the place of russia &apos;s national security council , which now also work on the new president &apos;s administration blames the driver .
blame comes from a family of soviet party elite .
the head of the administration of the president of the office had recommended the blame even ivanov .
we have long eduardovič of anton familiar .
another of those times when your leadership in government work .
and the last almost five years we communicate virtually every day .
&quot; therefore , i am sure that after all the professional and personal character references he is ready for this job , &quot; said ivanov .
blame comes from a family that belonged to the soviet party elite .
his grandfather karl takes high posts in the communist party of estonia , including the ten years up to 1988 was its first secretary .
the internet edition of the &quot; meduz &quot; with a reference to the book &quot; the self-determination and independence of estonia &quot; writes that at the end of the year 80 . karl had asked moscow blames for the authorization to use force against participants in demonstrations .
however , he received a rejection and soon lost his job .
in short then , blame has moved to live to moscow .
anton has graduated from the moscow blames the international relations institute and managed by the japanese .
however , he has left the diplomatic service to work in the presidential administration of the protocol .
vilks that gives russia the last of the shattered not more high ranking officials of the dismissal and even arrests , including several area replaced the governor and federal agents .
as the political scientist , president vladimir putin rearranged the ruling elite before 2018 in the upcoming elections .
one of the main features-more and more at the leading posts of the structure is valid .
also a judo wrestler Ņikiforenk losing the first fight of the olympics .
this was the first round of the fight , and the latvian judo wrestler his participation in the olympics , finished a has closed 17. place .
coach oleg baskin latvian television found that the Ņikiforenk had very little hope , and it was already clear before the race .
he also found that judo wrestler fight suffered a shoulder injury .
it is significant that to get to the olympic road signs , the Ņikiforenk had to start in another weight class , than get used-i.e. , the weight category up to 100 kilograms .
azerbaijani wrestler were 25 kilograms heavier .
vilks that yevgeny borodavk the fight weight category up to 100 kilograms of rjunosuk held against two and a half minutes to an opponent managed a clean victory worth the shot .
consequently , latvia judo competitions in rio has concluded .
dreams disappear rio sand .
thursday entered a džudist eugene borodavk .
yes , he was titulētāk against the opponent , but ambitious men sometimes can bring surprises .
he gave her .
arthur Ņikiforenk the task was even more difficult , because the experience less and the opponent also respectable .
the outcome is similar , although he held out the tatami was nearly one-and-a-half minute longer than borodavk .
unfortunately , the last time the latvian džudist &apos;s lack of ambition .
since from the federation &apos;s leadership aside , it took gigi and his financial Ķirson stut is vladimir Šestakov , from latvia left alexander jackevič , no longer happens &quot; golden score &quot; -judo development through declining curve of rio .
jackevič , which advises kazakhstan here džudist , and the zeļonij to the heirs vsevold sees .
but if not , bring up also .
and it is the prerogative of the federation .
therefore , as from another galaxy &quot; morning skyline &quot; was the latvian judo federation &apos;s presidential promise rio winning medals .
flight is far from reality .
evening with impatience and concern waited for beach volleyball match samoilovs / Šmēdiņš-evandr / pedro solberg .
intrigue as if &quot; death &quot; group-losers game over .
latvian duo both were minor derogation – could also lose , but not more than four points in two games .
tension or just extend the more protracted the previous game .
nobody wanted to die – this feeling over the windy court were all match long .
gusty wind created a players additional complications .
at first it seemed that it could be ours-what is comprehensive-ally .
but he did not .
against the latvian duo to play here was simple .
serve on the samoilov and wait until he bursts .
against canada , the torn against the cube breaks at the end of the first game and early in the third , because the load was not a joke .
Šmēdiņš at that time was on a fishing trip because the job was small , but when was it done well .
brazilian-samoilovs with Šmēdiņ was able to win two games , took the lead in the first with 16 : 15 , however , remained at 16 , also lost the point of depleting limit .
but it could also lose the second set 0 : 2 , because the deficit was-4 , however , also thanks to the wind , managed to get the victory .
the third evandr passed the servj already mark .
when the chain-unconvincing admitted serve , the second pass often flies too close to the network and stayed for a total of least samoilov option for successful attack .
if the cubans had to square some alien samoilov , then he worked better this time , and only to the loss of sasha novel would be unprofessional .
also , left-handed , and both failed in the symbolic , the last ball he slammed directly into the block .
lose the team .
this time definitely was also third in success-seth one two evandr attacks almost flew out of court , but the ball hit the line , however .
two eis were next to the line .
also the controversial episode video ruled in favor of the opponents .
if the first two games had to serve evandr , against ours they were very productive .
the total loss of all on board .
now he must analyse the failure causes .
maybe should have as many live next to the stadium , not with the delegation in the olympic village .
on the road it took two-and-a-half hours .
maybe a little confidence gave seven semi-final series .
maybe not – ought to play , but come here faster and better been acclimated .
maybe it was a failure , with sporty shapes vertices .
yet more questions than answers .
our bīčist games over .
the dream of medals .
what &apos;s next ?
even some of the remaining world cup tournaments and also a seaside &quot; masters &quot; .
Šmēdiņš with samoilov life have never been friends , and , as such is too different personalities .
but it is also not necessary .
once you have defeated the dream of olympic medals , may also think about divorce because the fault will be searched for not only yourself , but also the partner .
to decide is not difficult , but much more difficult in latvia will find a worthy partner .
the two brothers play bīč , but john tom is already tried and also parting , while mikhail samoilov is still too green to start the conquer the world summits .
you can try regž , alexander of harald solovej , edgar toč , return to martin meadow , but it would be better for this variant , which is not itself once one confirmed the world cup stages .
kopakaban sand them not smiling this time .
and everything .
of course , account must be taken of the fact that beach volleyball is becoming popular , new couples arrive in the circulation , and only rare stature is less than two meters .
it still does not guarantee success , but there is substantial argument in the fight for victory .
ours longer stays .
both athletes and journalists are able to inhabit the gamemakers places offered and choose their own .
the u.s. basketball team living on a cruise ship , part of tennis player does not remain in the olympic village .
also part of the beach volleyball is to provide on a kopakaban .
this time for journalists very pieticīgaj for accommodation providers were required to greatly exaggerated prices .
so the choice fell on apartment rental .
the risk is , because sometimes they can be uncomfortable from the logistics point of view .
this time , the risk is justified .
together with vladimir vladimirovič hiring of apartments on the kopakaban and ipanema .
beach 200 meters away , bīč arena a half-hour walk .
district and safe because the favelas in the distance , but vigilance to lose should not be there .
vladimir vladimirovich and not what some immediately think but the more professional sports journalist in russian media vladimir ivanov .
p. it looks like friday morning was another izsapņot medal dream .
100 metres hurdles and the high jump in laura ikauniece-admidiņ left behind from your personal records .
but there are five disciplines .
after a 10 year break &quot; porgij and best &quot; sounding in liepāja .
in latvia , the opera &quot; porgij and best &quot; pirmiestudējum experienced in 1973 to the latvian national opera .
since then , the internationally recognized masterpiece on a repeated behavior .
that &apos;s why cēsis art festival and the atlanta arts forum organizers closely decided to give listeners the opportunity to enjoy the george gershwin &apos;s šederv .

opera &quot; porgij and the best &quot; is a vivid musical language to tell a story about love , its fickleness , passion , as well as domestic tragedies and simple daily pleasures .
it reflects the vitality , afroamerikānisk music and rhythm .
it is this lack of political correctness in this opera , the exclusion of tolerance makes it so vital .
&quot; and yes , this whole romance thing is extremely powerful , extremely beautiful and somehow really profound , &quot; says director viesturs kairiš .
what i like most , -listening to or playing this opera , always the stop points-the famous melody , famous themes , but this transition from one character to another , illuminating the one character or another character , or choir , or orchestra .
&quot; this is the most exciting thing this work &apos; , the opera assessed the opera &quot; porgij and koncertiestudējum &quot; the best musical director and conductor andris button .
opera visitors agree that it is a grandiose event .
they have a great pleasure to hear the world famous gershwin &apos;s opera .
blessed that atlanta can feel the breath of the world .
&quot; the performance is professional &quot; , the opera assessed visitor edgar lahm .
koncertiestudējum was special in that the newly discovered in the concert hall &quot; lielais dzintars &quot; first played in the pit orchestra orchestra and first held the opera koncertuzvedum .
the area near the art museum &apos;s restored buildings might call yang &apos;s art .
riga andris vicemēr of american art jubilee exhibition opening that also in the museum &apos;s own address in the future might not be the cannon street which krišjānis barons recorded them , but janis rozentals 10 area 1 .
museum director judy lace candidly that re-registering will address a bureaucratic burden , however this idea is welcomed , and so agreed to the municipal proposal .
riga city kind of foundation of the idea has put in 1936 , the monument of jan burkard woodpeckers to rosenthal , who stands at the museum .
the then museum director wilhelm purvitis was one of the movers of this monument .
in such a way that further action could be a purely logical .
me and all the time a bit of conscience-but gnawing at wilhelm purvitis , where we will we put his name ? !
&quot; but if you do , the united states , the promise to think &quot; ... &quot; said the bear .

the road is a national card , particularly the border roads , so a special satisfaction is to discover the reconstruction phase on the border with our southern neighbours .
this is another example of that , thanks to european union funds for co-financing the situation on the country &apos;s major roads improved .
&quot; as forecast , this planning period the roads available funds will be acquired for 2018 , and we have to think how to continue to maintain the most congested roads in very good quality , and also to ensure the mobility of the population in all regions of latvia without funding the european union &quot; by cutting a symbolic ribbon stressed uldis augul .

&quot; to achieve the desired weight loss results , very important is the right combination of foods choices &quot; , admits lithuania &apos;s laura romerait dietoloģ-kuklierien .
in addition , it is easy in the summer period , when our own gardens , growing fresh fruit , berries and vegetables .
the prudent diet products combine can help not only to reduce excess weight , but also targeted to promote different body processes .
pasta and vinegar is a successful combination , because it provides long-lasting satiety and helps fight fat .
the study , published in the european journal of clinical nutrition , proved that vinegar affect glucose levels in the blood and helps us feel alive .
cayenne pepper and protein-rich food , such as meat or poultry protein cocktail , causing not only in the sense of satiety , but also reduces the desire for big meals the next meals .
such a combination could increase the food after a meal , the amount of calories burned up to 35 % .
studies have shown that cayenne pepper can help get rid of fat in the abdominal area .
eggs are a nutrient metabolism of incentive-choline and peppers is a good source of vitamin c .
taking enough of this nutrient can reduce cortisol levels , hence the accumulation of fat around the middle of the body .
oatmeal porridge , which added to the fresh berries , is another delicious and fat burning meal for breakfast , what is worth to include in your diet .
oatmeal and berries contain fiber , which in accordance with the conclusions of scientists in canada controlled by the grelīn-appetite-stimulating hormone , and thus the feeling of hunger .
in addition , the berries contain polyphenols , which are helpers for weight reduction , and also prevents the build-up of fat .
vegetables and protein also can do wonders for weight reduction .
this combination could cause satiety .
vegetables contain water and fiber , so promote satiety .
at the same time slow down the digestive process protein and provides satiety for longer time .
for lunch you can eat chicken with a salad or cook a protein cocktail from the finished mixture and enjoy it with your favorite vegetables .
from a combination of products to avoid .
fruit is sugar-monosaccharides or disaccharides-one or two molecules compounds .
by contrast , starch , vegetables , is located in the polysaccharide .
fruit breaks into the stomach , while chemically , mechanically it does not decompose until third or fourth grade to the digestive process , which occurs in the intestine .
the starch divided into three different stages that begins in the mouth .
therefore , it is essential to eat sweet food immediately after the meal .
eating sweet dishes immediately after the meal , it is &quot; trapped &quot; in the stomach along with other dishes , which it is not chemically digested and started rotting .
do not eat bread , potatoes , peas , bananas , dates , or other carbohydrate-containing foods with lemon , lime , orange , grapefruit , pineapple or other acidic fruit .
enzyme in the ptialīn located in the saliva , works only in alkaline environment .
fruit acids inhibit carbohydrate digestion not only , but also to promote fermentation .
do not eat eggs and meat , nuts and meat , cheese and eggs or cheese and nuts , meat and milk , eggs and milk or nuts and milk and similar protein rich product combinations for one meal .
the processing you need different digestive juices , each of them with different strength characteristics and time to reach the stomach .
medusmelon , muskatmelon , watermelons and other melons should always eat separately from other dishes .
melons are not digested in the stomach if they are combined with other foods .
fat in combination with protein-rich products .
fats form a successful combination with starch , however , the same cannot be said for fat and protein-fats inhibit protein digestion .
proteins can be combined with the very small amount of fat .
if consumed in large quantities of products containing protein , avoid the use of fat .
this also applies to svaigēšan-not recommended to combine large quantities of nuts ( protein content ) with a whole avocado ( fat ) .
this combination hinders effective weight reduction .
how best to cook ?
&quot; cooking , heat treatment causes a significant loss of nutrients-about 15 % to 55 % of the nutrient composition of original products , &quot; noted dietoloģ .
most of the nutrients go to waste by boiling food in water .
however , some of the food nutrient value increases , just boiling .
after the vegetables cooking the remaining liquid should be used in the preparation of soup-in this case , do not lose the nutrients remaining in water , and be able to eat them later .
we recommend that you prepare the vegetables , and steaming .
heat treatment significantly increases the tomato lycopene bioavailability in the composition .
boil the tomatoes for 30 minutes , the amount of lycopene increases by 25 % .
heat treatment also significantly increases the bioavailability of betakarotīn , which can be found in the red , yellow and orange plants , such as tomatoes , carrots , sweet potatoes and spinach in .
the eggs and heat treatment of meat takes away the protein they contain natural qualities , making it more easily digestible .
meat and eggs also heat treatment makes this product the iron and other minerals in the body of the lighter absorbable .
it must also be borne in mind that the freezing of the product can reduce the amount of vitamin c from 10 % up to 90 % , but freezing does not affect fiber .
beans with tomatoes in combination can increase iron uptake in the body , which in turn provides a better brain and muscle activity .
our body is up to 33 % less non-asinsradoš iron found in plant foods such as beans , leafy greens , cereal products , than the asinsradoš iron , found in animal products like beef , fish and chicken .
you can greatly increase iron absorption of non-asinsradoš of the body using diet not-asinsradoš iron containing products with vitamin c sources , such as oranges , tomatoes and berries .
vitamin c helps to not change the-asinsradoš iron so that our bodies absorb it more easily .
iron is necessary for the production of hemoglobin , which provides oxygen to the muscles and brain .
to gain maximum benefit from the salad , add those healthy fats , such as olive or linseed oil .
preparing sandwiches with salmon , add the vitamin d-rich to give the salmon or sardines , yogurt is a good source of calcium .
vitamin d increases calcium absorption by the gut , and it plays an important role in bone formation process .
oats ( as well as other whole grain products ) along with vitamin c sources , such as strawberries , blackcurrants , raspberries and other fruits or berries , help stabilize the cholesterol level , as well as to avoid artery blockage .
snapch &quot; anime &quot; effect on the kariķēšan of āzieš criticizes
you snapch representatives say that this filter is inspired by the animation , but some commentators argue that it is racially insensitive .
with this lens effect you let snapch 150 millions of users everyday rather absurd way to change reality and to play with their identity .
you can convert themselves to pineapple , dog or image that would fit in the lihštenštein painting &quot; .

you snapch lens effects have been criticised before , receive a reprimand , that promotes the application too dark or light skin tones as the ideal beauty of the benchmark .

news and public negativity flared wednesday when spending &quot; the slave &quot; and &quot; motherboard &quot; that lens effects are removed from the application .
the company explained that the purpose of the lens is the picture of the anime characters , not the caricature of the origin of the āzieš people .
but people who have experienced racism , these effects recalled the painful stereotypes .
others categorically denies the similarity with anime .
the origin of korean american art student grace sparapan twitter entry about the images got wide resonance . e-mail letter , she noted that the effects of the lens was &quot; offensive and uncomfortable , to say the least &quot; .
she added that it is difficult to overlook the obvious similarities between the asian cartoon and lens effects .
this suggests that the effect of the lens is not just any yellow face , the face of racism .
snapch are not the only company that has fallen into the trap of these cultures .
american culture is also involved in a never-ending struggle for diversity and inclusion , ranging from corporate meeting rooms up to hollywood and the devices that we use everyday .
and snapch for a large audience of young people representing different races , unlike the older people , are sensitive to such things .
if you snapch lens creates images that offend users , then &quot; today , such things do not remain unnoticed , &quot; said in an interview thursday the 25-year-old katie joe .

he also shared the views of others , while the snapch are not responded to her complaint .
the company did not disclose how many employees represent different race , indicating that it is a private company .
you refused to discuss his snapch employee origin , but his agent revealed that the company has hired a staff of specialists who focus on the enterprise is also represented racial minorities , which are not widely represented and encourage integration into the company .
joe will not turn your snapch your account , adding : &quot; i wonder if they really need more such users as we , to understand that this is not right . &quot;
congress , the court declared that the military officials of the sagrozījuš reports on the islamic country .
in a statement issued thursday in congress , the court noted that the u.s. central command , the representatives of the sagrozījuš reports , showing the war against the islamic state in iraq , and syria is in fact much more optimistic than that .
central command intelligence analysts expressing general discontent on the armed services committee , intelligence committee and defense funding subcommittee republican representatives created the task unit &apos;s interim report , indicating that their management control reports on the american success in the battle against the islamic country .
central command , known as centcom , is a military base in tampa , florida , which oversees u.s. military operations in the middle east and central asia .
the latest news on the message telling you that the intelligence reports , which confirmed the high ranking executives , reflects the us centcom fight against terrorism more positive than is actually there . the facts were distorted , regularly showing better achievements than show other intelligence analysis .
the california republican representative ken kalvert tells : &quot; centcom is unacceptable-the soldiers are the ones who suffer if our policy makers are receiving false reports . &quot;
centcom control error search organizations the highest management .
this 10 page long report reflects in detail the existing problems of the central command and the analysis of american efforts to prepare the iraqi forces to 2014 and 2015 .
although it does not provide conclusive evidence that the obama administration would have led senior officials misrepresent messages , however it shows that management has done some centcom pressure on analysts to portray a more optimistic perspective on islam ( also known as isis or isil ) threats .
the report shows that in 2015. in the first half of the central pārvaldniecīb of press releases , notices and reports to congress portrayed the situation considerably more positive light than it was in reality .
for example , centcom representatives publicly stated that mosul &apos;s recovery operation would begin in 2015 already in april or may .
mosul is iraq &apos;s second largest city , which is still in the control of the islamic state .
kansas republican party delegate mike pompeu their message reads : &quot; several-month investigation shows it . &quot;
from 2014 to 2015 among the middle of the us central pārvaldniecīb main officials twisted messages , displaying the isis threat in iraq , weaker than they were in reality .
the republican party has created a working group to learn that analysts are concerned that information about the islamic state is false .
the investigation progressed , a report published on thursday will precede the new findings in the case .
the ministry of defence is carrying out intelligence activities ģenerālinspekcij centcom investigation .
the intelligence committee of the administration of democrat party members on thursday issued their own report , in which they agree to some of the republican party to the conclusions of the working group .
democrat adam schiff &apos;s b in its report states , from 2014 to 2015 centcom too restrictive assessment of intelligence reports related to isis and the iraqi security forces .
mr. schiff &apos;s explains that this process &quot; stopped the distribution of information &quot; , under analysts &apos; work ethic and &quot; spread the truth according to the facts . &quot;
but schiff &apos;s and democrat party members added that there is no evidence that the white house has made pressure on analysts to centcom reports , developed according to the &quot; predefined or political position &quot; .
the daily beast thursday published a congressional investigation , the preliminary results .
in august , the new york times reported that the pentagon has begun an investigation after ģenerālinspekcij centcom analysts &apos; complaints .
pentagon spokesman lieutenant commander patrick evans announced that the pentagon will not comment on the report , while congress will continue the investigation .
he also added that the experts sometimes interprets the various complicated data , and the ministry of defense and intelligence agency calls for constructive dialogue on vital issues of national security .
the investigation does not relate only to the question of whether the american-led bombing campaign in iraq , and syria is successful ( statement , expressed more and more representatives of the ministry of defence ) .
but last year &apos;s indictments call into question whether president obama can fully rely on the central pārvaldniecīb of the reports on military operations in iraq , afghanistan and other hotspots .
criticism regarding the islamic state intelligence recalls more than ten years old events when the centcom intelligence analyst gregory hūker is issued a study saying that george w . bush administration launched the war in afghanistan , too little thought of the consequences .
hūker also played a significant role in islamic national intelligence issue detection .
last year the official representatives reported that the hūker team discovered that in contrast to the public reports , the air raid of the islamic nation &apos;s oil factories do not have significantly worsened the financial situation of a terrorist grouping because they had built temporary factory to sell oil on the black market .
the times reported in september that this discovery does not come out of the walls of the central pārvaldniecīb .
current centcom commander gen. lloyd austin iii , received sharp criticism , as many law makers are considered the war reports describe the situation too positive .
in april he &apos;d retired austin and in his place came into general joseph l . votel .

the depression period expressed the dish is &quot; excellent meal &quot;
in march 1933 , shortly after being elected president of the franklin delano roosevelt sat down in the oval room for a meal .
president roosevelt liked the fine culinary delicacies as goose liver pate or fuagr and turtle soup of maryland .
but today his meal was far more modest : the stuffed eggs in tomato sauce , mashed potatoes and dessert-plum pudding .
jane ziegelman says : &quot; it &apos;s a way of solidarity for cooking with people doing very heavy . &quot;
her husband by andrius adds : &quot; it is also a message to the americans , as should eat . &quot;
a couple from brooklyn heights district is a food historian .
what the last book &quot; vegetable stew &quot; described in chinese cuisine in america , but in their book , &quot; ziegelman 97 apple trees &quot; describes the life through food , rent house in manhattan east .
their new joint work &quot; excellent meal , &quot; which will be published in the publishing house on tuesday harper , is the story of the american food during the great depression .
showing some solidarity in cooking , they ate lunch together reporters &quot; eisenberg &apos;s sandwich shop &quot; , a simple lunch in the diner , located in the flatiron district and works from 1929 , when the great depression began .
54 year-old ziegelman she ordered a sandwich with melted cheese and chopped olives , while the 57-year-old ordered by turkey , mashed potatoes and vegetable salad .
when a reporter ordered a couple of fake bunny , admitted that his choice is very appropriate to talk about the great depression during the meal .
ziegelman &apos;s mistress told me that the meatloaf was very popular .
there was a peanut bunny , hare liver , and bean bunny .
they were made from basic ingredients and other ingredients that have enriched meal .
imagine how is it-eat so many peanuts to be lunch .
what the lord scowled .
&quot; probably thought that the stomach is full of lead , &quot; he added .
pirmsdepresij years of american dinner table resembled a swedish table , especially in rural areas .
women are going to eat his men-workers and the breakfast , lunch and dinner were served freshly cooked pie .
in the first world war the americans are sent directly to the europeans . &quot; excellent meal &quot; described how americans adjust to the circumstances when america suddenly was no longer a land of abundance .
&quot; at that time , the dish became the united nation &apos;s main object of attention in everyday life , &quot; says the lord , by explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about this topic .
just as important was the new budgetary diet : the unknown dishes like meatloaf and stews become everyday , stew had been &quot; a great way to use leftovers , &quot; noted mrs. ziegelman , because cooks unable to hide the unattractive ingredients under creamy sauces .
fresh fruit replaced the cheap dried fruit .
the meat , which for years was a key part of american meals , now became extremely rare luxury items .
at a time when the number of calories and nutritional value of food was more important than taste , born new , unprecedented formations .
in a recent cookbook she found in ziegelman recipe how to cook with peanut butter-filled bulbs .
what the lord says : &quot; it was not a popular addition to the dinner table . &quot;
mrs. ziegelman stresses : &quot; it was surreal . &quot;
the peanut butter and fried onion are not compatible .
many home food recipes application for difficult times .
the household of economists as louise stanley , the federal household economic office manager from 1923 to 1943 , established the national eating habits that were not there before the great depression , not after it .
publishing articles and recipes in newspapers and magazines , they advised housewives become &quot; economists &quot; and accept the challenge to turn pasta and carrots in delicious miksl meal .
&quot; excellent meal &quot; is a meal of delicacies .
particularly interesting are the evidence of the government &apos;s attitude to its hungry citizens , for example , president herbert hoover &apos;s &quot; let me eat cake &quot; attitude .
although he publicly talked about his childhood and simple meals in iowa , he ate as a millionaire , at which he was to become .
what the lord is telling : &quot; he loved the european cuisine , such as fish with cucumber sauce . &quot;
he ate almost gilded parlor , wearing a dinner jacket .
he was completely cut off from reality .
president roosevelt would have made the same mistake , unless his wife eleanor would not have recommended him to lead by example with their eating habits .
the book taught that roosevelt contracted a domestic , not able to cook , so the white house became a place where not only was hailed one of the dishes at negaršīgāk in washington , but also the worst prepared food &quot; .
as soon as the economy recovered , most depression-era culinary customs disappeared .
but we continue to pay attention to calories and nutritional value , as well as how to apply the science of cooking , &quot; said mrs. ziegelman .
the couple said that while writing the book , they got a better understanding of her mother ziegelman eating habits , for example , why she could not throw out the food .
&quot; she really was afraid to throw out food , &quot; said that mr .
mrs. ziegelman said : &quot; they actually drove him crazy people . &quot;
had the incident with the cake .
when we had eaten eisenberg in the diner writer couple pulled out of the bag of homemade desserts : plum pudding , what president roosevelt liked to eat lunch .
&quot; it &apos;s a plum whipped cream , &quot; said mrs. ziegelman , adding that at the time was the widespread habit of modest meals given chic name .
it is not only whipped cream prunes , a little flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
all anxiously dipped spoons brown mass that was on the plates .
surprisingly , it was not so bad .
what mr ate a few bites .
izklausot by an experienced &quot; economist &quot; , he said to his wife : &quot; should the ground hazelnuts pinch . &quot;

britain must maintain the olympic spirit and to extend heathrow .
heathrow would not only enhance the prosperity and growth of the local regions and london , but also throughout the country .
this , in my opinion , makes it very attractive for heathrow , just like in 2012 in london , where we invested a huge work , to all regions of the country would benefit from the olympics .
stratford and east end got extremely much of the olympics .
and we &apos;ll do it again , providing local residents and companies with business opportunities not far from heathrow .
local communities one we &apos;ll make 10 000 new business opportunities , 40 000 new jobs and eventually will use the point youth unemployment in the heathrow area .
like the london olympics in 2012 , also this time will be the people who would think that this challenge is too great and that heathrow expansion is too ambitious .
back then people said that britain never fail to prepare for the olympics and that it will be a global failure .
skeptics were wrong about 2012 and also the heathrow case , they will not be true .
there are always obstacles that must be overcome , but heathrow has so far overcome everything .
like the olympics , heathrow is the infrastructure project , which will benefit the entire community rather than individuals .
enlargement is able to generate up to 180 000 new jobs , economic growth of 211 billion , creating employment , both the soil and the experience in the airport and throughout the uk .
heathrow works great for a team that has produced 11 billion pounds worth of infrastructure investment programme within the time limit and budget starting with terminal 5 , which is five years from the site was named the best airport in the world and the terminal to terminal 2 , which is built between two intense use of runways in the world .
now they are ready to build a third runway , which will be funded with private investment of 16 billion pounds .
the 2012 london olympic games were a great success , and i am sure that this will also be the heathrow expansion .
it &apos;s time to revive the olympic spirit and to expand heathrow , ensuring the future of our trade and creating new employment environment , with which the united kingdom would be proud of .
lord paul dayton is heathrow board member and former secretary of the economic ministry &apos;s commercial .

nasa climate model : venus had once been habitable planet
based on nasa &apos;s latest climate models , venus ever had a habitable planet .
nasa goddard institute of space studies , scientists have developed a model to explore the history of venus , using the tools and algorithms , which are also used by climate scientists .
the model was developed to determine whether to venus , which surface is hot , which is not water and atmosphere consists almost exclusively of carbon , have ever been earthy .
scientists previously have raised speculation that the slow speed of rotation of the venus is explained by a dense atmosphere .
recent simulations show that venus used to be thin , earthy atmosphere and it turned slowly .
the model also looks at venus earlier topographies .
on the planet had more dry area than on the ground , but they had enough water and geographic diversity , to build a life and not to evaporate the water .
the early times of the sun , venus was about 30 percent brighter .
gis simulation model of venus spin model reveals that the light of day on it lasts for 2 months , the press release said giss scientist anthony del genio .
this process heats the planet &apos;s surface and cause rain , which in turn forms a thick cloud layers that act as umbrella , shielding the planet from solar heat .
results in the temperate temperature , which in reality is a few degrees lower than the temperature on the earth today .
model represents the history of venus , which is similar to evolutionary theory , what your hypothesis will be developed by scientists .
although it was once habitable , for several billion years , venus has been exposed too much to heat and ultraviolet rays .
its oceans are izgaroj , and burning ultraviolet rays vapor .
the water completely through evaporation , over only a thin carbon dioxide atmosphere with deadly greenhouse gas-venus , as we know it today .
scientists published a new venus climate model results in the journal &quot; geophysical research letters &quot; .
patrick roy will resign from the avalanche coaching post
on thursday the colorado avalanche coach and vice president of hockey operations patrick roy presented the resignation , citing as a reason for the insufficient effect of command decision making process .
colorado vice president and a year award joe sakic confirmed this news and informed that the club will immediately begin the search for a new coach .
&quot; in the last three years i &apos;m energetic , dedicated and purposely performed his duties as head coach and colorado hockey club vice president of operations , &quot; their statement says the 50-year-old roy .
this summer i have been much thought to how i could improve the team &apos;s performance , to give it the required brightness and achieve superior results .
to achieve this , the main coach and vice president of hockey operations the visions must be fully coincides with the organization &apos;s vision .
they must also be able to influence decisions relating to the team &apos;s performance .
at present , these conditions are not met .
sakik , who hired roy-23 may 2013 , said roy for his contribution to the team .
sakik told patrick of his decision he was informed today .
we appreciate all that he has done for the benefit of the organization and wish him all the best in the future .
in his first season with the avalanche team in 2013-2014 roy was considered the league &apos;s best coach and received the jack adams award .
he helped the club reach the 112 points and first place in the central division , but off the game in the first round of the colorado team defeated the minnesota hockey players . since then , the club has already reached two years off the games .
avalanche closes 2015-2016 season with a score of 39-39-4 and stayed five points behind &quot; wild &quot; commands , not winning the western conference organizer second special invitation .
hall of fame goalie roy his career won four stanley cups-two with the montreal canadiens and two with the avalanche .
north sea oil platform workers resumed negotiations and postpone strike
employee strikes on north sea oil platform workers &apos; salary is deferred , as both parties to the dispute shall commence negotiations , says chief negotiator .
periodically against the oil processing company &quot; wood group &quot; is organised strikes on north sea oil platforms that are running the company &quot; royal dutch shell &quot; .
total communication states that &quot; wood group &quot; and &quot; unite &quot; and &quot; rm &quot; trade unions have agreed to resume talks on the dispute .
subsequent weeks are for more full-day meeting , which will begin next week with the aim of beginning to reconsider the problematic issues .
trade unions said that their recent actions , organized by more than 25 years , is directed against planned salary cuts of 30 percent .
the negative market pressures &quot; wood group &quot; this year reduced the salaries of workers in the north sea about 9 percent .
if the 2014 company reduced the wages of workers on land by 10 percent .
the company explains that the additional salary cuts would allow the company to survive the market downturn .
while the &quot; shell &quot; has already reduced the salaries of several thousand people and announced plans to stop oil and natural gas activities in 10 countries to optimize their work in preparation for a large-scale merger deal with british energy company bg group &quot; &quot; .
energy companies feel the pressure of falling oil prices , and the situation is complicated by several british decision yet to leave the european union .
at the beginning of the week the scottish mp dave anderson met with workers &apos; representatives to discuss one of the most important issues-the north sea strike plans .
he said that the north sea is vital to the economy of the region .
in his message , he explains that the north sea and the country as a whole need the economy to benefit from prisoner of all , rather than by individuals .
2016 the new north sea projects is expected to invest nearly 1.4 billion dollars , compared with 7 billion dollars invested in the last five years .
kepler-size star spin speed in the constellation pleiades .
later , kepler telescope mission helped astronomers to gather the most complete catalog of stellar rotation speed in the constellation pleiades .
the new data helps astronomers understand why stars in this constellation turns at different speeds , as well as the manner in which the stellar rotation rate applies to planet formation .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other constellations , we gain more information about the relationship between the mass of the stars and even the age of the solar system &apos;s history , &quot; a news release said the caltech in pasadena infrared process and analytical center researcher luisa rebul .
pleiades constellation located 445 light years away from earth .
many of the stars in the constellation only begin to rise , reaching approximately 125 million years old .
they come with a maximum speed of .
spinning with a maximum speed of this rising stars emit copious amounts of stellar wind .
the winds come in the stellar magnetic field , they slow down the stars .
stars ages , their speed decreases .
kepler measured speed of rotation of the stars , setting the time between a recognizable star area , such as sunspot , .
latest star speed catalog shows that larger stars rotate slower than smaller stars .
rebul compares stars with dancing , larger stature of spin slower than performing the dancers little dancers .
rebul tells that the pleiades &quot; ballet &quot; shows that the slow rotating objects are larger and sturdier and faster rotating objects are very small stars .
thanks to the pleiades constellation located so close , it serves as a great laboratory of space where you can compare the characteristics of stars with speed .
rebul tells that the pleiades constellation helps build theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions , both older and younger stars .
we still have a lot to learn , how , when and why will slow down the speed of rotation of the stars and the full stop in the process .
rebul and his colleagues detail presented the pleiades star speed analysis of three new publications , which will soon be published in the astronomical journal .
