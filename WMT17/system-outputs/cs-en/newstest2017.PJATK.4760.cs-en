czech railways have invested in the modernisation of vehicles over 31 billion .
they have air conditioning and new toilets .
in the last six years has invested state carrier to upgrade vehicles over 31 billion crowns .
a third of cars is currently equipped with air conditioning , roughly half of the trains , the new system is closed .
amounts to upgrade each year , with the exception of 2012 , however , gradually falling .
czech railways in the last six years have invested in the modernisation of vehicles over 31 billion crowns .
a third of cars is currently equipped with air conditioning , roughly half of the trains , the new system is closed .
consequently , the money appeared in the reduction in the average age by two years for locomotives and separate units and six years for classic cars .
the larger share of investment gave the carrier into the regional transport , the roughly 60 percent of the money , 40 per cent then the company has invested in a recovery vehicle for long distance services .
the average age of the locomotives and units currently stands at 19 years .
a modernised older vehicles are counted as indicators but in this entirely new .
if the upgrade did not include vehicles , increasing the average age of powered vehicles Čd about ten years .
the older they are , on average , cars , whose average age at offsetting the modernisation is 23 years old .
should only take into account the age , from the date of manufacture , the average age of those vehicles would be 33.4 years .
classic set composed of wagons and pulled by a locomotive , but in recent years , from czech and worldwide railroad gradually disappearing and are being replaced by motor or electrical units .
between 2011 and 2015 , fewer locomotives from 280 to 223 pieces , decreased the number of classic cars from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in the middle of this year .
the carrier shall , in particular , getting rid of old vehicles equipped with her hand now seats and door without blocking the opening during the drive .
from january to july left the carrier to scrap 110 of these cars .
the investment , which the vehicle fleet planning Čd take place in the near future , it is possible , for example , the purchase of 50 wagons for speeds up to 200 miles an hour , the carrier plans to put on an international route prague - bratislava - budapest , or a framework contract for the purchase of electric units for domestic fast trains along the route .
the treaty provides for the collection to 30 pieces of motor and 20 pieces of electrical units .
the quarter they know about illegal advertising , unable to get rid of her .
we &amp; apos ; re absolutely helpless , granted .
no quarter aktuálně.cz follows the story of a billboard in south bohemia , which now attracts motorists to visit lipna , where it is not only the most interesting walk in the trees , but also an olympic park .
managers of motorways , they know it &amp; apos ; s there , but says he can &amp; apos ; t do anything .
similar ads are all over the country hundreds , maybe thousands .
according to officials is to blame poor law , for which there is no possible illegal mobile billboards now removed .
what is needed is a complex bureaucratic first .
in the meantime , but the company will change the name and office is on her short .
or enough advertising to move a few metres and the official process has to start all over again .
the road and motorway directorate ? months ago admitted : in the main from České budějovice on the lipno is on our land in the state road advertising billboard .
not even three months but officials , have not been enough to get rid of illegal portable structure with a giant advertising poster .
like no one cared that he was standing beside the road in the fifty-meter protection zone , where for security cost nothing .
road operators argue that with a billboard for děravému law cannot simply advice .
maybe him and get them out .
&amp; quot ; you can &amp; apos ; t just afford , &amp; quot ; says the spokesman for the directorate of road and motorways nina renal and refers to the complex bureaucratic wheel , which remove the billboard must , by law .
the case of this particular billboard , whose fate he began the online daily aktuálně.cz closely monitor in the spring , is not an isolated and points to a general problem that can be dealt with quickly and efficiently and the authorities .
just v jižních Čechách redakce counted dozens of similar mobile ads placed against the rules right next to or near the road .
so , too , are other lands .
&amp; quot ; we have difficulties to make company boards to remove , &amp; quot ; confirms the transport department boss českobudějovického krajského úřadu jiří klása , whose colleagues have similar stories .
according to klásy holes is to blame the law that binds the officials .
he must be hard put to call the owner of billboard advertising .
but company bosses are often better than anyone , or know the trick , which aktuálně.cz reported on in the past , when the issue was more interested in a stand with mobile advertising : just move a few yards and officials may the previous challenge to eliminate black advertising thrown in the trash .
that &amp; apos ; s because office must determine exactly where illegal billboard .
&amp; quot ; if someone moves and coordinates suddenly disagrees , treated it as a new equipment and we need the owner to address again , &amp; quot ; explains george klása .
the new law won &amp; apos ; t help .
the change could bring a new law which , from september of next year , prohibits the billboards for motorways and road is even in ? st class .
critics point out that the rules for combating illegal and easily transferable ads remain the same as before .
and authorities are so easier .
companies on the leases of irregular surfaces may make tens to hundreds of millions of crowns per year and none of them can .
for example , a billboard inviting on the lipno belongs to commerz billboard .
officials know it well : českobudějovický magistrate with her currently runs three administrative proceedings for illegally erected billboards .
the risk in any proceedings třísettisícová fine .
this is a more commercials , which have been placed without authorisation in the protection zone of main roads .
the proceedings are not yet closed , &amp; quot ; says jaroslav frost , head of the department of transport českobudějovického magistrátu .
advertising , which aktuálně.cz interested , namely between these cases is not yet , soon to them but most likely will be .
according to the spokesman , the rmd nina kidney firm didn &amp; apos ; t respond to repeated written invitation to remove , and the case gets to the table and then probably magistrátním county officials .
the company commerz billboard is one of those suspect firms that fail to contact .
nepřebírá post office and official residence na Žižkově canceled more than six years ago .
it &amp; apos ; s not even clear who &amp; apos ; s behind it .
in the past , mail firms went to jihočeskému entrepreneur anton fischer , who famously sharp dispute with the boss of the czech representation brand hyundai .
fischer , whose company euro billboard you area from comerz billboard rents and offers is advertisers , however , has in the past rejected any link .
but this spring , when the initiative began , the rmd aktuálně.cz interested in advertising on the lipno , fischer , state officials sent a letter to a mysterious company commerz billboard to his rooming house , where the new company has its seat .
not from this address are however no one motorway controllers still haven &amp; apos ; t heard from him .
a futile fight .
a similar silence or opaque changes seats are not unusual .
one company years ago , we gradually put the fine for two million crowns .
but change the name and id , and it was a no-brainer .
the bankruptcy case back , advertising cost more , maybe in other places .
we are against such firms and their business practices pretty helpless .
it &amp; apos ; s like a fight with windmills , granted under the condition of anonymity , one of the officials .
novelu law in this regard no one yet does not address .
aktuálně.cz discussed with a number of members , that is the problem .
not yet but developed no activity .
on the contrary , discovered the members who wanted to extend the deadline for preserving the billboards for the main czech communications .
the government denied it .
the billboards are not only for national , but also regional and municipal policies very sensitive and somewhat schizophrenic theme .
on the one hand they know about societal demand their restrictions , on the other hand , is themselves they need to advertise in election campaigns .
i am definitely not the relatively established under the impression that when something doesn &amp; apos ; t work , so there is a need for a change to the law .

france to hit factory , jihadists .
without the help of muslims but it won &amp; apos ; t work .
france are in the fight against radical islamism help themselves muslims .
the government of prime minister manuel vallse in addition to major changes in the operation of mosques and the training of the clergy .
since last december , we closed 20 mosques and modliteben .
and more will follow , said interior minister .
in a country works over a hundred plants jihadists .
&amp; quot ; if muslims won &amp; apos ; t help the country in the fight against those who undermine public freedom , it will be increasingly difficult for france to guarantee freedom of religion , &amp; quot ; said prime minister manuel valls .
ensure intends to , inter alia , to preach in mosques and churches only imams who have been schooled in france .
it wants to stop the funding of mosques abroad .
right now comes from abroad , about 20 percent of the money for the construction of new mosques , most from morocco , algeria and gulf countries .
and because of that , then the mosques they are preachers , who in france can spread radicalism .
&amp; quot ; our country has to show that islam is compatible with democracy , &amp; quot ; said the prime minister .
the key , which will ensure the fulfilment of these goals , it will be the new french islamic foundation .
this should act as a bridge between the secular state and the muslim minority .
no more money from abroad .
in a country now operates the french foundation for islam , founded in 2005 by then prime minister dominique de villepin .
even then , the foundation should contribute to the transparency of financial flows between the mosques and countries that their construction financing .
but the institution will soon suffer from internal divisions and rivalries .
&amp; quot ; it &amp; apos ; s a total failure , &amp; quot ; said recently valls .
in the french political scene , after the attack on the magazine charlie hebdo in january 2015 , a debate has a new institution that dysfunctional foundation .
all spurred further terrorist attacks in france , which in the name of islamic state have done zradikalizovaní islamists .
french interior minister bernard cazeneuve has recently said that the new foundation will be this year in october .
it will have two main tasks - to ensure the financing of mosques from domestic sources and also oversee the imams .
for now , it is not clear where he will take the money not only for the construction of new mosques , but also various training centres .
but is being considered several proposals .
one of them is a special fee or tax on halal food .
that would in practice pay vendors halal food , and that granting certification .
part of this money would then went right into the coffers of the foundation .
the contribution of ? ? euros ( 270 to 540 kroner ) would then be able to pay french pilgrims , to mecca .
every year , there are the traditional pilgrimage to saudi arabia is about 30 000 .
and not only that .
according to the prime minister would be in the mosques in the future should operate preachers who passed through special educational programmes at french universities .
this should ensure that the sermon was in accordance with democracy .
radical mosques shut down .
the french government is at the same time in the campaign against militants .
and more will follow , he said recently the minister of the interior .
in france , there is no place for those who preach hate in mosques and do not respect certain principles of our country , such as equality between women and men .
the country is estimated to have about 2,500 mosques and modliteben .
it is estimated that about 120 of them is under the influence of radical islamism .
since 2012 , authorities banished some 80 imam and several other dozen are considering it .
not everyone , however , thinks that the government can significantly affect against radicalism .

young doctors pushing : they want fresh wind in the field
the young doctors gathered to approve new steps in their dispute over a new contract .
the council of young doctors ( jdc ) at the british medical association ( bma ) must apply for all the advice and support of other events from the beginning of september .
jdc says that ministers with questions about the contract has not been able to resolve .
the young doctors and medical students in july voted to reject the contract agreed with the bma .
she was rejected by 58 % of its members who took part in the elections .
in a letter to members published on thursday night on twitter , president of the jdc ellen mccourtová stated that the government remained &quot; remain silent &quot; on the issues , which veldo to reject the contract .
she said : &quot; in light of this , the authority of the executive jdc decided the proposed new contract vote completely rejected and demand a new formal negotiations on all issues &quot; .
in response to the silence from the government today , the executive council of the jdc has formally requested a special meeting of the bma to agree a running program and extreme actions from the beginning of september .
the dispute led the young doctor to publication in six strikes this year , including the first general strikes in the history of the nhs .
bma junior doctors leader , dr johann malawana , resigned after the rejection of the agreed terms of the contract , which the bma recommended .
members of the bma at the meetings before the vote before the 54 000 young doctors and medical students , said that the agreement was good and should be accepted .
after the vote , the health minister , said that the contract would mean for students in england .
russia and turkey : an alliance &quot; incompatible &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended the crisis .
the leaders of russia and turkey met on tuesday , to join hands and announced the formal end of eight months long war of words and economic sanctions .
but while vladimir putin welcomed turkey &amp; apos ; s counterparty in the luxurious lobby of the palace in st petersburg , i was under the impression that ankara wants to aspire to this reconciliation more .
there was a handshake , yes .
but putin wasn &amp; apos ; t smiling and radiating warmth , even in his measured standards .
recep tayyip erdogan , on the other hand , has repeatedly talked about his &quot; dear friend &quot; of mr. putin - five times , as one of the reports .
i didn &amp; apos ; t count it .
he also promised that relations with russia are not only back to its level before the crisis , but they will be even better .
the next day , one of the local newspaper wrote that erdogan was , as if nothing bad ever happened .
i think his enthusiasm showed the exact opposite .
but the lingering chill which emanated from putin , he showed that the russian leader has forgotten nothing .
the real cause of the crisis was the first thing i mentioned in my introductory speech : downed russian fighter aircraft by turkey on the syrian border .
moscow &amp; apos ; s reaction was fierce .
putin punches around and ankara accused moscow stuck the knife in .
offense was all the greater , that came from an alleged friend .
again to build real confidence it will be difficult , maybe even impossible .
russian public opinion from december also changed .
state controlled media for months led a massive campaign against ankara .
suddenly , it looked as if the turks could for everything .
more serious charges were from top state officials about the fact that erdogan &amp; apos ; s own family had benefited from the illegal trade in oil in the parts of syria controlled by the so-called islamic state .
that this is strongly contested .
but in st petersburg came an official message that it &amp; apos ; s time to move on .
after all , to this meeting took place only because putin got the apology from president erdogan asked .
russia could declare a victory of sorts .
in ankara the truce , the benefits are clear .
in first place was erdogan during a failed coup last month was almost deprived of power and therefore needs all its friends .
the repeated terrorist attacks in turkey , it also visibly shaken .
there is also an economic motive .
russian sanctions have a hard impact - in particular annulment of the charter , which each year several million russian tourists off the coast of turkey .
this number has decreased by almost 90 % .
as regards russia , tour operators and charter airlines here have certainly earned a rest , if there is a resumption of flights .
they make the mediterranean tourism at the end of the season .
even state television this week promised cheaper fruit and vegetables to be re-created , imports of agricultural commodities from turkey allowed .
&quot; the tourists there , tomatoes back here &quot; , as it said the report in the newspaper vedemosti .
visit but for moscow further political value .
ankara is angry at the west for what it considers to be the lame response to the coup attempt .
in addition , the longstanding animosity lengthy talks on joining the eu and putin - who are eager to take advantage of cooling and disrupt turkey &amp; apos ; s ties with the west .
the russian leader certainly get bonus points , when ankara requested the assistance of the authorities after an attempted coup .
you have to understand that for moscow , which has a deep rooted fear of regime change , it &amp; apos ; s a given .
so the summit in this pompous , a seaside palace russia and turkey allowed to show what one analyst described as &quot; an alliance of incompatible &quot; : how to combine forces , two countries which feel rejected and used the west .
of course , despite the fact that the public have shown mutual reconciliation , there are fundamental differences between the two countries .
the first is syria , where moscow recently built into the role of peacemaker , but where russia and turkey are on opposite sides .
you could say that , after a nearly three-hour introductory talks , the two presidents at the press conference said that on this issue they didn &amp; apos ; t .
the turkish president to deliberately avoid the answers to the question about the differences between them , while putin has decided to highlight these differences .
there is no clear agreement , on the basis of which the two states could find common ground on syria .
but after months of open hostility - and due to the risk of utter disaster , when nato member turkey shot down the russian warplane - is certainly better that the two leaders are at least talking again .
royal bank of scotland will disappear for customers outside of scotland
according to the ceo of the bank rbs brand is to be suppressed in the role of the back office .
royal bank of scotland is lost for customers outside scotland .
ross mcewan told bbc scotland that the rbs brand was associated with global ambitions .
of these , subsided when eight years ago almost died and had to be redeemed from the debt .
at that time the brand makers used &quot; rbs &quot; in order to protect the other brands of consumer finances .
they cost her millions of pounds spent on sponsorship of international sport , from the six nations rugby championship after championship winbledomu andy marraye .
but now it was decided that it is better to give more to stand out more national brands .
royal bank of scotland will apply for scottish customers , but will not be available to run the new business .
all reference to rbs in england and wales , with the exception of the headquarters and encoding of shares on the stock market , will be changed to &amp; apos ; damn .
for customers in the republic of ireland and in northern ireland , the ulster bank brand is already being used .
there are other , smaller brands for private banking , which come more to the fore - coutts , adam &amp; amp ; co , drummond , and holt &amp; apos ; s military bank .
during trips to customers and employees in inverness-shire us mcewan answered questions ross mcewan .
station bbc scotland said : &quot; the rbs will cease to be our investor brand and brand , for which our staff are working , because it is now much more we bank brands &quot; .
because the bank itself has become a global brand , is a global brand and rbs .
now , i say that we don &amp; apos ; t have global aspirations , we have efforts on the domestic scene .
each of these brands will be within their own communities to mean something completely different and our workers will be working under these brands .
rbs has already indicated that it would not continue its sponsorship , the six nations championship , has prepared a profile of each brand sponsorship of sport .
&quot; now is the time for us to move to the bank , because the fundamental issue ( which we are ) is how to focus on that to become the best bank for customers ? &quot; said the ceo .
three years ago , it would be very cynical , if we say that we will become a great bank for customers and those markings were introduced .
but along with that , as we focus on customer needs , and not on our own , i think that there are a lot of changes .
can we remind these marks somewhat , i think that now is the right time .

russian president vladimir putin dismissed the chief of the presidential office of sergei ivanov
russian president vladimir putin on friday unexpectedly fired sergey ivanov was the chief of the presidential office .
ivanov was one of putin &amp; apos ; s closest associates for many years .
třiašedesátiletý ivanov was appointed special representative for ecology and transport .
in a statement from the kremlin , it is stated that putin has &quot; loosened ivanova from his services head russian presidential office &quot; , but did not specify the reason .
his place will take over anton ivanovovým vajno , who has been a representative since 2012 .
security vajno was previously a diplomat .

in appointing putin said : &quot; thank you for your confidence &quot; .
i believe that the most important task of the administration &amp; apos ; s support to your head of state activity within the meaning of the laws and control the extent to which your instructions are respected .
putin on friday russian television station , that ivanov asked him to release from the post and recommended vajno just to replace it .
he &amp; apos ; ll convince smiles ?
this step completely mystified moscow .
sergei ivanov was podlouhou period one of vladimir putin &amp; apos ; s closest aides , and like putin worked for the kgb .
as head of the presidential office was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with president putin , broadcast by state television , the two men said that the chief of the presidential office is going at her own request .
but smiles to the cameras have convinced few people - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
this is therefore the result of a power struggle ?
nobody knows , not yet .
but the official claim that the man once considered as a possible president , suddenly wants to lead russia &amp; apos ; s environmental policy , was met with a great deal of skepticism .
on the website of the kremlin are cited comments made to putin , in which ivanov stated : &quot; it is true that , in 2012 , i asked in a conversation , to me this very post , you could even say problematic post , entrusted to four years .
apparently , i was the boss of the presidential office for four years and eight months .
ivanov &amp; apos ; s position took over in december 2011 .
before that , he held the position of deputy prime minister and minister of defence .
he is a member of the russian security council and previously , like putin , he worked for the committee of state security ( kgb ) .
at the end of the 90 . , when putin was in charge the federal security service of the russian federation ( fsb ) , which replaced the kgb , ivanov was appointed his deputy .
when putin came to power , ivanov was named one of his five closest aides .
at the time even speculated about that ivanov could become the successor to putin at the head of the state after his second term , because it would be for putin &amp; apos ; s third term was unconstitutional .
this post but took another close associate of putin , dmitry medvedev .
putin &amp; apos ; s return to the presidency on a mere three and a half years later became prime minister .

despite the massive size and weight of the bridge was the completion of the locks between the viaduct and the platform of the bridge a delicate operation that required extreme accuracy .
in its place is now a total of more than 79 % of the total area of the bridge , the concrete for the last part of the platform is now cast in rosythu , so the whole platform is ready for pickup at the bridge .

this we did stretch north approach viaduct 700 millimetres in a southerly direction .
this was a massive and at the same time a very delicate operation .
massive because viaduct is 222 yards long , weighs 6,000 tonnes and was necessary to drag it to rise about 3 per cent .
delicate , because tolerance , which the team worked , were very small - only a few millimeters each way .
fortunately , everything went very well .

dream job for the hundred thousand salary .
great paying job , to which even you don &amp; apos ; t need college .
so at first glance , looks like the work of a computer guy .
and , often , on the other .
the advantage is not only on the czech situation extremely high salary ( in prague to work in it you make up to 180 000 czk ) , but also extreme advantage .
this is due to the huge lack of it specialists .
missing thousands of specialists .
according to the estimates , is missing in the czech republic almost 20 000 it specialists .
among the most wanted of according to the statistics agency grafton programmers , developers , network engineers and specialists .
the candidates to choose between several offers of work .
so nesoupeří candidates about the job , but the positions of the candidates , says jitka součková , marketing manager at grafton recruitment .
the high school is not a necessity .
higher education is not a necessity for the tech .
higher education means a good basis and is an indicator of intelligence and vzdělatelnosti candidate , but has often little to do with knowledge of the development .
developers must constantly learn new things , which once educated high school will not replace , says peter kubačka , director of monster career cz .

&amp; quot ; employment conditions are comparable to those in prague , &amp; quot ; confirms kubačka .
on the highest earnings reach the technical directors .
in prague and brno you can come to 120 000 - 180 000 kč .

poptávaní are also it project managers .
at the onset may earn 60 000 - 100 000 kč .
the fight is about the graduates .
while in some professions must be graduates often straight to work , for the geek doesn &amp; apos ; t count .
if the firms drag and overpay expert from other companies , like to reach for grad .
they can raise him on my own .
without language .
knowledge of foreign languages is useful in every profession , but the geek is necessary at least decent english .
the knowledge of at least one foreign language is a necessity in some it positions .
on the other hand , we are dealing with the number of cases where firms are seeking in particular professional educated and experienced person and feel satisfied only with an average knowledge of english .
however , the aid worker , for example , has more foreign language , is interesting because for his employer can serve more customers from different countries , adds director kubačka .
yeah in google , there &amp; apos ; s a paradise .
just quietly envy can czech workers staff in google .
the flexible working time for them , the opportunity to work from home or part-time , not only for the mother .
&amp; quot ; novopečeným fathers gives the company an extra four weeks &amp; apos ; leave after the birth of the child , &amp; quot ; says martin joneková , a spokesman for google .
pampering includes health care for staff and family , meals , transport , training , spa or massage right in the workplace .
who wants to learn , he &amp; apos ; s got the green light and it doesn &amp; apos ; t matter what new wants to learn .
but the benefits don &amp; apos ; t end there .
such a full fridge , also free of charge is certainly not to be sniffed at .
a healthy lunch ( in some locations , including breakfast and dinner , is available on the site every day .
in addition , they are in all the offices of the so-called mikrokuchyňky , where people always find a healthy snack , says spokesman .
and didn &amp; apos ; t have to throw out , so what , it doesn &amp; apos ; t eat into boxes , which employees can take home at night .
and the reason these na české poměry incredible advantages ?
create a creative and motivating environment !
&amp; quot ; for google is not important that employees were sitting in an office for eight hours a day , but the results of the initiatives or projects , shift or developments , ideas and innovative solutions , &amp; quot ; adds the spokesman .
united nations sharply criticized bulgaria for the criminalisation of refugees .
zeid ra &amp; apos ; ad al-hussein , the un commissioner for human rights , accused on thursday bulgaria , that systematically violates human rights , the criminalisation of the refugees .
the official strategy of the bulgarian government &amp; quot ; raised serious concern about the fact that bulgaria does not comply with international law , &amp; quot ; zeid ra &amp; apos ; ad al-hussein said in a statement .
he warned that &amp; quot ; it is particularly disturbing to witness this , as important and influential public figures expressed public support for the criminal militant outfits , which boldly hunted on refugees at the border between bulgaria and turkey &amp; quot ; .
&amp; quot ; one of the most serious problems is that nearly all people who switch to the bulgarian territory irregular manner are being arrested , &amp; quot ; said zeid .
and what &amp; apos ; s even worse - often they are prosecuted and imprisoned - for a year or more - if they try to leave the country .
their attempts to leave the country are criminalised , despite the fact that , under international law , everyone has the right to leave any country , including his own .

pokemon go - the pursuit of health and happiness , which will pay off
it &amp; apos ; s fascinating to watch how the world is changing .
a number of people during the last decade , lamenting that , teenagers and kids no longer play outside and prefer to spend free time in front of screens .
pokemon go lifting people from sofas and leading them to activity .
time spent in front of screens initially reduced to tv , later on video games and , most recently , on smart phones .
it &amp; apos ; s great to watch that technologies and activities outside se nevzájem .
i &amp; apos ; m talking of course about fashion , which is the pokemon go app , based on the figures , which first appeared in the video games at the end of the 90 . ( later created a cartoon series , playing cards and others ) .
as with many cultural phenomena , and there has been prior to this new games at the beginning of july in the us , australia and new zealand to the decline in interest .
those in other countries then was postponed because of the massive interest that led to overload servers .
pokemon go has a few days to more users than tinder and nearly as many users as twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players on a smart phone and go out looking for pokemon , which are monitored using gps , and when they find them , they may be &quot; take a picture &quot; ( a screenshot on the phone ) or &quot; catch &quot; .
mania has gripped a generation that played the game at a younger age , lifting it from the seats and drives out looking for pokemon .
in the us , thanks to this game , there was a substantial increase in the number of steps that the &amp; apos ; average &amp; apos ; person does every day .
aplikace cardiogram for smart watch from apple , which monitors 35 000 users , recently told the washington post that during the two days of the start of the game , the number of people who practiced every day for 30 minutes , jumped from 45 to 53 percent .
the company has no information about who the pokemon go playing - only see the raw data on the levels of exercise .
many public campaigns seeking to ensure that people &quot; found 30 &quot; , &quot; got up off the couch &quot; and &quot; were active every day &quot; , fell on deaf ears , because the majority of messages aimed at public health is boring and for people who don &amp; apos ; t look good .
yet the importance of exercise must not be underestimated .
those who exercise regularly , reduce the risk of cancer or depression .
physical activity is involved in the control of weight , high blood pressure , diabetes , and a long list of benefits that we can &amp; apos ; t all be .
but the beauty of the game pokemon go is based on the fact that people go out and do something that is fun .
pokrýváte so the three pillars of health - exercise , fresh air and sunlight . and fun .
some people even in pursuit of pokémon will get new friends .
as it happens , there are of course also those boring patrons , who are looking for any excuse to to complain about .
and yes , anyone can walk in the door .
and what like ?
it was a breakthrough .
in his time applications for smart phones , such as the fitbit , could monitor our activity , but did not give us a reason to do anything , as is the case in this game .
news flash to look in and the interest starts to wane at some point .
of course , thanks to the success of the pokemon appear more games , which will be combined with virtual reality apps and activity in the real world and will help many people in pursuit of activity , health and better form .

simon bilesová won gold in the women &amp; apos ; s gymnastics all-around
forget the pressure .
forget the excitement .
simon bilesová is immune to all this .
dynamic on vault .
no effort on beam .
the floor all dumb .
brilliant in everything .
and now , finally , the olympic champion .
a ? ? -year-old american gymnast went straight on thursday for the title in the all-around and the other badly under the olympic spotlight .
the overall result 62,198 clearly confirming her early ahead of the silver and a member of the team &quot; final five &quot; aly raismanovou and russian bronze mustafinovou aliya early .
simon bilesová ( usa ) on thursday , during a performance on the balance beam in the finals víceboje individuals in the sport of gymnastics at the summer olympics in rio de janeiro , brazil .
bilesová became the fourth american in a row who won víceboj , and fifth overall , when confirmed his reputation as the best gymnast of his generation and possibly the best ever .
when it was her total final assessment on the board and its a long drive up to that point was over , there were tears on her face .
this achievement puts her in the same league , isolated athletes of his time , as is michael phelps , who added a new dimension to the sport :
bilesová dominated his sport for the last three years , won 15 medals in world championships - including 10 gold , her fascinating reports are a mixture of ambition and accuracy and the 1984 olympic champion mary lou retton it has identified as &quot; the best gymnast , had ever seen &quot; .
the last test was waiting for her in brazil , not so much between bilesovou and the rest of the závodnic , but between itself and the burden too great expectations .
anything else , before returning home to his family in spring , texas , with a handful of gold medals , would be seen as a disappointment .

the first bilesová received tuesday , when it was as an exclamation point in the party , the outgoing national team coordinator martha karolyiové .
bilesová insists that during their long journey to the top never looked forward , but that &amp; apos ; s not entirely true .
part of her convoy in the floor - the one that contains the typical of her triple flip with a double turnover - is embedded in the latin music , which would be just threw home , took to the streets outside the olympic arena in rio .
it &amp; apos ; s not a coincidence .
the girl was adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and her mother discovered a talent coach aimee boormanové boormanová on the way to the gym , where he trained and where he got the strength .
the competition in the all-around lost since the summer of 2013 - a sequence of victories , which may continue for as long as bilesová will want .
although mustafinová took a short lead thanks to two otočkám , it was an illusion .
beam and unholy - where bilesová defending world champion - are waiting .
she got back into the lead with 15,433 points for a balance beam - and complete with 15,933 points in the floor .
raismanová hugged her gently as they waited for the final score - a mere formality - and around the shimmering red , white , and blue shadows to bilesové tears , if you wish , that you once wrote in my diary as a kid .
the raismanové was a bit of a payback for the olympics four years ago , when sharing third place with bronze mustafinovou , then her but because of the sum of the three best reports .
this time the ? ? -year-old team captain , which americans say &quot; grandma &quot; , was much in front .
after blowing kisses to the crowd , sending its floor , eliminated the return , which sometimes appeared uncertain .
for bilesovou &amp; apos ; s contribution that this ? ? year-old athlete this week on twitter , where he became a smash hit , a whole new meaning :

but unlike its peers to suffer from microcephaly , which is the result of genetic disorders , of which his mother , elizabeth picciutová , during pregnancy .
when he first came home , my first thought was that i can &amp; apos ; t do this .
i can &amp; apos ; t do this .
i &amp; apos ; m not ready for this .
which is not at all true - clearly , that you are ready for it , &quot; she said .
she and her husband vincent learned that edmund is perhaps will never know and that might not make it .
some doctors even suggested that he was placed in an institution .
&quot; my first reaction was that i thought that people don &amp; apos ; t do this anymore &quot; , explains picciutová .
edmund walks with the help of a walker .
until the age of three years , couldn &amp; apos ; t sit or crawl . and still doesn &amp; apos ; t talk .
some milestones already but slowly .
he comes with help and ride a bike .
i also love to play with his two brothers and loves to sing .
elizabeth doing sign language , using that edmund says &quot; please , sing me &quot; .
&quot; we &amp; apos ; re teaching him sign language &quot; , said picciutová for cbs news .
but it &amp; apos ; s not the normal sign language - says that edmund some characters came up with that myself .
microcephaly can occur from a number of different conditions : genetic , as is the case with edmund , and after infections in pregnancy caused by viruses such as measles or zika .
the symptoms and prognosis may substantially differ .
it &amp; apos ; s too early to say what impact it will have on the lives of the zika virus infected .
picciutová recalls the emotional toll that chooses the uncertain future .
constantly asking : &quot; what &amp; apos ; s next ? &quot;
what &amp; apos ; s next ?
and still isn &amp; apos ; t sure .
in fact , i never asked you , what is the overall prognosis , because i don &amp; apos ; t expect anyone would be able to say .
picciutová &amp; apos ; s upbeat message for the mother of all the children that suffer from birth defects caused by the zika virus .
the situation is improving .
know that it will be better .
you love your child and your child will love you .

why we need simon , laurie and gabby
just like that i imagine the women gymnasts for this year &amp; apos ; s olympic games , and this for several reasons .
first of all , i was at every summer olympics since 1984 and the us have never been so dominant .
and second : in this team are three gymnasts , simon bilesová , gabby douglas and lauren &quot; laurie &quot; hernandez , which inspired so many young girls of color .
everyone is proud of the composition of this team , which complements raismanová aly , who is jewish , and catholic madison kocianová .
finally we have a team that looks like america .
also , the presence of black women and latinskoameričanek at the top of the sport .
a gymnast number one in the past four years was african-american .
simone and gabby were last year on the first and second rung .
that means something .
at the last olympics , gabby dougalsová surprisingly become olympic champion and america cheered .
now the world can witness the incredible performance of triple world winners simon bilesové , douglas and laurie hernandez , which demonstrated an unexpected , but mastering gymnastic moves .
on thursday , simon has become the fourth american , who won gold in the women &amp; apos ; s individual all-around .
a team member aly raismanová won silver .
we are witnessing a sports top , but in the hours of gymnastics in the country it doesn &amp; apos ; t seem like it .
simon , gabby and laurie completed the olympic team the same way as aly and madison .
they are the &quot; final five &quot; , because a team of gymnasts at the next olympic games will be made up of only four athletes , and this is the last year , when marta karolyiová coaches .
the fact is , however , that gymnastics is financially demanding sport and gymnasts train mostly in private gymnastic clubs that keep parents , who pay the cost of training , equipment , travel , the uniforms , the charges for the competition , hotel accommodation ( for coaches and their charges and the family ) ... and it is far from all .
most of these sports clubs is in rich areas in the suburbs , which can support .
in these clubs are gymnasts all practice and for the families of gymnasts and gymnasts is a costly and long-term commitment .
aimee boormanová , coach simon bilesové , and maggie haney , the coach laurie hernandez , both trained athletes , at a time when began in gymnastics .
it is our duty to practice gymnastics , which are more affordable and accessible to communities of countless young girls that simon , gabby and laurie inspired .
foundation for gymnastics i started 20 years ago .
in my organisation , where we offer gymnastics free of charge or at a low cost in harlem for more than 15 000 young people in the town ( mostly black and hispanic ) and training national and international champions .
in september we will expand to detroit ( my hometown ) , where we provide a quality gymnastics to young people , who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great olympic sport .
gymnastics develops the strength , flexibility and coordination body and hard work , discipline and determination .
this combination means a lifetime benefits for good health , achievement in school and at work .
it was an inspiration to the team will be sending thousands of young girls who will want to do gymnastics . and that &amp; apos ; s great .
participation in this sport is very important , especially for girls .
it &amp; apos ; s a very exciting time .
thank you , simone , aly , laurie , gabby and madison , for that you have shown &amp; apos ; girl power &amp; apos ; and you win olympic team gold . and thank you for that little incentive so many young girls of all different backgrounds , to travel to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
after rejecting a proposal jeremy hunt are young doctors are prepared to enter into further strikes
ministers had hoped that , after the conclusion of a revised agreement with the representatives of the british medical association ( bma ) will exit the disagreements concerning changes . but 58 percent of the 37,000 junior doctors who took part in the elections , rejected the contract .
hunt in july revealed plans to enforce the contract , with the nhs was in &quot; no man &amp; apos ; s land &quot; , and further delays could have a detrimental effect on staff and patients .
the first young doctors have already signed a new contract , which includes changes in late night and weekend working practices with a view to improving care in nesociálních hours .
the doctor ellen mccourtová , chair of the bma for the young doctor in a statement last night said : &quot; the young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract , above all , in the sense that there will be an increase in the current crisis the workforce and thus for a fair treatment of all physicians &quot; .
only eight weeks before the first group of doctors will come under a new contract , it is necessary to make progress and are running out of time .
the bma to resolve the disputes through negotiations met with reluctance to involve dr. and often with a deafening silence from the government .
and despite the promise of jeremy hunt from last month , that this option is still open .
&quot; jeremy hunt must now act to push enforcement and resolve the concerns of junior doctors &quot; .
if this is not the case , then are young doctors are ready to make the next move .
during the last strike at the end of april , the postponement of routine operations of almost 13 000 and 100 000 visits , because nurses and specialists were called to barred doctors , who were among the protesters .
ministers had hoped that , after the conclusion of a revised agreement with the representatives of the british medical association ( bma ) comes to the conclusion of a disagreement on the changes .
bma wants higher payments for working on a weekend for 54 000 young doctors , who would have been the subject of a contract .
daniel mortimer , chairman of the nhs employers , called the young doctor , not to any strike .
mortimer said : &quot; oborovou actions will achieve little or nothing at all , but there is a pressure on the already overburdened teams and services and increase fear , exhaustion and the disruption to patients , medical staff and their families &quot; .
in the past two months we have discussed with the board of young doctors and , together with the ministry of health and the other we positively responded to concerns about the role of supervision and an informant .
employers had hoped that the continued positive involvement in other issues such as workload , flexibility training , further training for those who are returning after a career break , the costs for training , the mutual recognition of objects , study time , and the difference in pay between the sexes - was proof of how seriously employers , health education england and the health department take the bma with the agreements which were reached in november , february and may .
the cure for ? ? kroner a day can reduce the risk of heart attack
thousands of patients at risk of heart attack will be able to take the medicine , which is the equivalent of standing around ? ? crowns ( two pounds ) . it more patients administered recommended the authorities over a longer period of time .
ticagrelor reduces blood clotting medicine in people with heart disease , the risk that an attack occurs again .
the drug is now after a heart attack is given over a period of 12 months , in order to reduce the risk of stroke or seizure .
nhs watchdog nice recommended that the drug was given to people for a period of four years , to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
but now the nhs watchdog nice recommended that was given to people for a period of four years , to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
in england suffer heart attacks each year , about 140 000 people , and a quarter of them will suffer another heart attack or stroke .
heart attack and stroke are caused by the accumulation of fat , which on the walls of arteries creates a continuous layer .
if the secession of this layer , may result in a blood clot , blocking access to the blood to the heart and heart attack .
if the clot released , can carry on through blood vessels , blocking blood flow to the brain and cause a stroke .
people who have had a heart attack already , are at greater risk of further attack .
ticagrelor produced by british company astrazeneca , which is sold under the trade name brilique reduces the risk by clots which is less likely .
in the proposal for a directive of nice , which was made public , it is recommended that patients receiving 90 mg ticagrelor for a period of 12 months and then 60 mg , along with aspirin , and that twice a day for the next three years .
professor carole longsonová , director of the centre for health technology evaluation for nice , said : &quot; despite the availability of effective secondary preventive treatments there is a quarter of the patients who have had a heart attack and the other will suffer a heart attack or a stroke - often to the consequences &quot; .
fear of a repeat may have a significant adverse impact on the quality of life of the patient .
it has been shown that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already suffered a heart attack .
it is our pleasure that the preliminary recommendations ticagreloru we can extend the treatment options that are available to many thousands of people who will be able to benefit from it .
because information on the efficacy and safety of ticagreloru - particularly about the dangers of bleeding - beyond three years is limited , it is not in the draft , the recommended treatment over that period .
with computer culture began to flourish fraud in muslim areas
the mayor of tower hamlets lutfur rahman was removed from office last year for corruption , which has been associated with a government report
the culture of political correctness has led to the neglect of the spreading of fraud in muslim communities , it is now in a government report .
ex-ministr sir eric pickles has sharply criticised the police , election inspectors and council that ignored abuse voters for &quot; hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion &quot; .
the former communities secretary , now lord of anti-corruption measures , said that voter intimidation on the basis of their religion is so bad that the police should do cordons outside polling stations and vystražené voters to protect .
it recommended that voters to bring id at the polls and they can prove who they are .
currently , voters can indicate their name and address .
the report also proposes that the fingers of the indelible ink applied giving voice to avoid that someone will vote twice .
whistlebloweři should have more protection , says pickles .
he wants the press to have greater access to the documents of the meeting and the decision by the unofficial committees or pracovmí group .
&quot; this is not just a protection against electoral fraud , but also the protection of local governments before the wider corruption and financial fraud , which with that go hand in hand &quot; , he said .
the report sought to downing street as a result of electoral scandal in tower hamlets in west london .
last year a special electoral court has ruled , the acting mayor lutfur rahman should be dismissed from his post after allegations of corruption and illegal practices .
the court found that rahman had &quot; cynically &quot; the religious feeling of his muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and islamophobia .
rahman , according to their words &quot; led his campaign , so that it was the religious duty of observant muslims to vote for him &quot; .
up to 300 votes were challenged or as a result of identity theft , when a person votes and issued to you by someone else .
sir eric said that there was evidence of fraud in the country .
he expressed particular concern about fraud in postal voting - of which , it is claimed that the older members of the muslim community during pressured him to people , to vote for the candidate they have chosen .
sir eric , on the slide , he gave several recommendations on how to clean up the electoral system , including the submission of a proof of identity
his report states : &quot; he was proof that the vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities , particularly women and young people , he was pressured to vote according to the will of the elderly , especially in communities originating from pakistan and bangladesh &quot; .
&quot; there are concerns that state institutions such clouded eyes because of &quot; politically correct &quot; hypersensitivity to ethnic origin , and religion &quot; .
sir eric made 50 recommendations on how to clean up the system , including the disabled , political activists , in order to manipulate the correspondent voices and so prevent &amp; apos ; extraction votes . &quot;
the report , which is now reviewing the theresa may , also calls for tighter control of the authorisations , in order to prevent the use of lists of candidates for immigration fraud and fraud with doses .
consider the possibility to require voters to present proof of identity before voting .
use an indelible ink on fingers of people voting , in order to avoid that someone will vote twice .
implementation of systematic controls the nationality of persons , in order to ensure that they can vote for .
applications for automatic postal ballot restricted to a period of three years .
disable political agitators and activists , to manipulate submissions korespondenčními votes and electoral envelopes .
to give the police permission to create around polling stations cordons .

disable taking photographs in polling stations .
require that the polling stations were only the english ( except in wales ) .
enhance training , in order to ensure that personnel abide by a rule that voters go to the polling booths .
sir eric criticises the london police and says it is &quot; surprising &quot; that the case of tower hamlets have been no accusations of criminal offences .
&quot; the court ruled the election for lutfura rahman and his agent for the litany of corruption and illegal practices &quot; , he said .
for a number of reasons was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - the strength of the evidence of a crime .
he also criticises the failure of &quot; controls the check boxes &quot; in departments for registering voters at the town hall .
sir eric said : &quot; last year &amp; apos ; s court ruling in the case of tower hamlets awakening .
our nation has a proud legacy cradle of parliamentary democracy , but disturbing and hidden the spread of electoral fraud , and the refusal by some authorities are threatening that reputation .

where is vinyl : who buys vinyl records ?
vinyl love lonely middle-aged men .
before you decide to comments section to overwhelm nevšichniosamělímuživestřednímvěku racy comments under a pseudonym , we note that this statement is based on the actual data .
according to yougov &amp; apos ; s much-discussed resurrection of records associated not with boom mileniálů who want to enjoy the originality of owning a physical object , but nostalgic for the middle-aged .
those who have recently bought an album on vinyl , are the most likely people aged between 45 and 54 years old .
young people aged 18-24 are the least likely .
it &amp; apos ; s not even really about the accumulation of an enthusiastic fan - it is an emotional dimension : older people who buy vinyl records , you &amp; apos ; re more likely to want to keep their feelings ( 56 % versus 53 % ) and are like ourselves ( 69 % versus 66 % ) .
but yougov results are true ?
if this blog was broadcast as a tv story , followed by my camera , as i &amp; apos ; m off to a busy street in soho , wearing a decent suit and widely gestikuluji . then i stopped , pulled out his hand and said something to the authoritarian , like : &quot; let &amp; apos ; s look at it &quot; .
let &amp; apos ; s look at it .
while the heart of soho , slowly fading away his charm and magic - the building once occupied by independent sellers , are now filled with hotels , restaurants and canteens , department store and office supplies - a fantastic specialist record shops have left .
i probably would have asked the camera to film for a while . i &amp; apos ; ll stand in the vicinity of the various men in these shops and i &amp; apos ; ll try to see , what is their age and emotional state of mind .
stuart ( 55 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ) , a native of glasgow , which i watch of sister ray ( the numbers : two young women , three middle-aged men ) to reckless records ( numbers : eight middle-aged men , one woman about 20 ) in london in the afternoon meeting , looking at the business , to fill a few hours of time .
i ask him if he &amp; apos ; s a collector .
&quot; i think so &quot; , he says .
i have about 3 or 4 thousand records .
all those records line the walls of his living room - the picture at the top ( a picture sent to me by email , i didn &amp; apos ; t follow him all the way home ) .
this huge amount of albums and singles , is also due to the fact that he can afford it : he can now buy vinyl records , which couldn &amp; apos ; t afford when they were originally , and then buys what he sold in his youth , and he didn &amp; apos ; t have a dime .
&quot; a lot of what i buy is from the late 60 . &amp; apos ; s and the early 70 . &amp; apos ; s . they &amp; apos ; re the things that would be issued to me when i was 11 or 12 , when i was very small and could not get these &quot; , he says .
it agrees that those who buy the records , are probably introverts who like the company ourselves . and adds : &quot; i don &amp; apos ; t smoke and don &amp; apos ; t drink too much .
this is my sin .
wez ( 25 ) works in sister ray and also thinks that many customers , with whom he meets , fits into the profile of yougov .
he also noticed a new influx of people affected by the media wave . people who heard and felt the comeback is forced to buy his old gramophone records back .
according to my interviews with people in their collections of most often between 1998 and 1999 .
customers who once sold their records and cds , now sell their cds to vinyl records they bought back , &quot; he says .
that might explain the boom records lovers of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional importance of records ?
it won &amp; apos ; t take you more than a few seconds to the store as phonica found that in stores with the music is nice community of people with a similar bent .
according to weze are particularly offended by some of the older customers with contactless payments .
some supporters of records in the digital world may feel overwhelmed and decided for the familiar environment of packaging of records , things that raise memories of the peaceful adolescence .
&quot; i think that filling a gap or owning something tangible may bring some comfort &quot; , says wez .
i &amp; apos ; m a collector , for me , it &amp; apos ; s so , and i think a lot of people too .
it &amp; apos ; s an easy way to fill the space in my head .
&quot; we all like their social workers ! &quot; the co-worker from piles of vinyl records .
icm survey in april found that nearly 50 % of people who bought a vinyl album a month early , it still disobeyed .
according to the survey 41 % of respondents record player , who never used , while 7 % of those who buy their records , record player .
at this point , the story was probably looked really worried when browsing stacks compilací bossa nova .
the &quot; trophies &quot; and the recovery of interest is something i noticed jonny ( 42 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ) , which works in the sounds of the universe ( number : three middle-aged men ) .
&quot; someone just came in and said : &quot; i don &amp; apos ; t have a record player , but i want to buy on radiohead , we could put it on the shelf , &quot; &quot; he says .
the percentage of such is not large , but there is to it .
it is more about product page than the music .
he comes to us people who say : &amp; apos ; i don &amp; apos ; t have a record player . &quot;
it &amp; apos ; s the younger people , not older ones , more than teenagers , who are getting it .
fopp , which is currently almost all of one floor reserved gramophone records , on my way in a much more diverse visitors .
there are pairs of ? ? -year-olds there too , the tourists what they do pictures , teenagers and women in middle age .
while the atmosphere is not so loose , as stores previously - the speakers instead of tahavého jazz echoes the latest pop from wild beasts of synthesizers and sex , it &amp; apos ; s good to see different customers .
none of them look particularly haunting mental trauma alone , but hard to guess when you &amp; apos ; re standing next to someone for 30 seconds .
elanora ( 27 ) for a few minutes in fopp is looking at all the different records on sale .
it &amp; apos ; s one of those who &amp; apos ; d rather look at expenses , rather than feverishly spend .
according to his words isn &amp; apos ; t much of an earner , so out of the question that the records collected .
it costs a lot of money .
it &amp; apos ; s easy to listen to music on a computer or whatever . but records have their magic ... , &quot; sighs wistfully .
i can &amp; apos ; t explain it - it &amp; apos ; s unique .
my last stop is trade , which reportedly inspired a new generation of vinyl records : urban outfitters .
i &amp; apos ; ll pretend that i &amp; apos ; m very biased calves girls in tight jeans and a group of teenage girls who just polaroid cameras crowding around . then the father and daughter crosley record player purchasing decisions .
on the left is the staircase , whose wall covering records adele , jeff buckley , amy winehouse and fleetwood mac : a mixture of contemporary and classical music , the basis of any average collection of records .
nobody looks at it - perhaps because they are just for decoration , and some are so high on the wall , that they can &amp; apos ; t achieve .
it &amp; apos ; s purely a &quot; vinyl trick &quot; .
but because any attraction to him could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers into soho for another , there &amp; apos ; s not much to complain about .
it is no surprise that the demographic area , where it is more likely to be more time and money than in other areas , is also the one where most spend on luxury goods , such as vinyl certainly is .
but while according to my findings , it appears that the results of the yougov poll are accurate - at least in record shops , do not take into account the large amount of sběratelek and vinyl lovers , who are , in fact , record stores and in online forums .
these people probably work hard in schools or in offices .
he doesn &amp; apos ; t spend thursday morning wandering around the shops with record on berwick street , browse through the records and avoiding looking at the strange , a ? ? -year-old television presenter , who hides behind unsuspecting middle-aged men .

the court in france refused to tear down the shops in a refugee camp the jungle
the court dismissed the order of authorities in france in calais the demolition of dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the jungle camp , home to thousands of refugees .
during the court session this week , the authorities in calais have argued that the state should be able to cancel a total of 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp are selling goods , from cigarettes to energy drinks , offering the haircut , in makeshift restaurants sell tea for 50 cents or basic meals for a few euros .
the prefect &amp; apos ; s office in calais , it argued that the place should be torn down , because they represent a parallel economy which does not pay taxes , and because the risk of fire and health risks .
humanitarian organisations in court indicated that the shops and restaurants are vital and that the food for free , which is offering supported by associations and other groups , do not provide supplemental food for the growing numbers of refugees in the camp .
the makeshift shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to people in need .
the court in lille ruled that there is no legal basis that would prevent people 72 makeshift shops operate , but indicated that the objections to the prefect of calais are &quot; entirely understandable &quot; .
judge jean-françois molla said that food outlets , cafes and restaurants have a much bigger role than just food to the people who &quot; are living in extremely dire circumstances &quot; .
he said that premises provide quiet places to refugees and volunteers .
one of the sites , which threatened to demolition , was a coffee shop in the camp , the jungle book kids , run by a non-profit organisation which provides 200 meals a day , hours of english and french and asylum advice for hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp .
petition to protect &quot; children &amp; apos ; s &quot; coffee shop has signed more than 170 000 people .
the guardian received a letter , which would close the cafe &quot; was a disaster for these children , some of them even just 8 years old &quot; .
the charity help refugess and l &amp; apos ; auberge des migrants on friday estimated that the numbers of refugees in the camp after a steep rise in arrivals over the summer have risen to more than 9 000 - which is still by far the greatest of all time .

they were my appeal , and i won .
if anyone likes it or not , or if he has a different opinion , whether recourse to arbitration court , she added .
herman : disappointment , we could win .
and start at midnight ?
i don &amp; apos ; t remember .
czech women have experienced a strange day .
it was less than an hour before the game , against whom they know will succeed .
they had quickly handle tactical preparation .
and then , in a non-traditional time , began the game on a small court number 1 .
the first set started well , then made a head start against , but in the 19 : 19 failed the extension .
in the second , they were clearly better and equal , but the decisive tie-breaker them didn &amp; apos ; t work .
first of many broken service meant losing 10 : 15 , and parting with the olympic tournament .
&amp; quot ; we could have beat the russians , &amp; quot ; said hermann .
how would you evaluate the game ?
herman : after a disastrous start , before i played , so we really got into the game .
in the last of the balloon flew me to income , on which i have used before .
we lost that set , which was key .
in another set of them entered with an overview on the field , another defence and we pushed on the service .
in the tie-breaker was very corrupt administration , we &amp; apos ; ve had on this site .
it was disappointing , because we could beat the russians .
sluková : too bad the start of the first set , we just missed it .
we did it to withdraw , but the points we were missing .
the second set was great and the third rule .
we made too many mistakes .
they have granted them five points and of those five was it , we were there a lot of hesitated .
it &amp; apos ; s a shame , because the russians have been playing .
how have you played on a small court number 1 ?
sluková : similar as in china on the side yards .
the environment and atmosphere were different .
it was one o &amp; apos ; clock in the night , complete silence , music played , nothing .
that was the difference compared to the center .
such conditions we have not chosen , but we can &amp; apos ; t pick and choose .
what was the preparation for the game , when you see the names against an hour before the game ?
herman : it was strange .
we started warming up for the game without knowing protihráčky , so we could not do tactical preparation as the other teams .
but simon ( coach nausch ) , set up the tactics almost all the possibilities that were there .
he had prepared a lot of paperwork with the tactics , so after this site we were pretty well prepared .
do you ever started the game at midnight ?
herman : i guess not .
we played ? ? : ? ? , but at ? ? no .
block russian birlovové in předkole playoffs on oh in rio .
beach volleyball markéta sluková and barbara herman in an embrace in the playoffs předkole oh in rio .
was it awful ?
sluková : by that we played the last two games in the group from ten , so we should scheme shifted before .
this was still about two hours more .
it &amp; apos ; s funny , i can &amp; apos ; t imagine any other sport &amp; apos ; s athletes , who have given their best performance in ? ? hours .
but i think we have prepared as best as we could .
we knew it would be , but entirely typical it &amp; apos ; s not and i don &amp; apos ; t think it &amp; apos ; s my favorite time to play .
how do you assess the olympic experience ?
herman : since the procedure from our goal , that is , on the one hand , okay , good .
we did what we said .
but now , after the game , i &amp; apos ; m sad .
sluková : i &amp; apos ; m gonna sleep and from tomorrow i &amp; apos ; ll be on the olympic tournament is not positive .
big brother is here , comes the first šmírovací sim .
you cant escape her .
the new rules are to apply to all persons without a thai passport , while in thailand decide to get a sim from one of the local operators .
i mean not only to tourists , but also to persons with long term visas , which in thailand , for example , work or there not entered into a marriage .
the secretary general of the office of the national broadcasting and telecommunications commission takorn tantasith is informed that there will be no exceptions .
the sale of sim intended exclusively to foreigners to meet national telecommunications regulator in early august .
the new measure , which will allow monitoring of their position , the authorities intend to implement within six months .
according to tantasitha regards the means to maintain national security , which will allow to solve crimes committed just strangers .
the so-called tourist sim also have to help detect and persons , which exceed the authorised length of stay .
for sellers would be in six months to a year should be side by side with sim solely thajcům also occur a special sim for foreigners .
odlišností will just function monitoring , which will be in the cards for persons without a thai passport permanently on .
is it possible to turn off .
&amp; quot ; this function in sim for thai is not , because you can always easily monitored , &amp; quot ; added tantasith .
it should be added that , in thailand are not předplacenky anonymous as in the czech republic .
the seller requires proof of identity .
on the other hand , for years one of the operators was handing out free starter sim to tourists at airports .
you were fully anonymous .
the introduction of the same measures as thailand is considering even ten telecommunications regulators from other asian countries , including , for example , malaysia or singapore .
even in them are currently paying a mandatory registration of sim , but legal use of the tracking system is not possible .
the forthcoming measures does not mean for foreigners to get a local sim when entering the country .
they can of course use roaming services with their own home sim , in such a case , the thai authorities will be short .
operators of the country after the crossing of the border , after the sim to their network , they know only the relevant network information .
they know the phone number , but not information about the owner .
however , the difference of roaming prices compared to the rates of local operators is so great that even the majority of tourists during your stay in thailand will begin looking for local sim .
the authorities have to monitor the movement of foreigners by foreigners living in thailand legally received immediate criticism .
tantasith calms the situation with regard to the protection of privacy and the forthcoming system compares to the obligation to provide a residential address in immigration documents .
police will also be monitoring in case of need specific persons need a court order .
for any misuse of the system would face an unspecified punishment .
&amp; quot ; if the service provider to monitor the location of sim without a court order , will be charged with a criminal offence , &amp; quot ; he added tantasith .
the system should also maximise the use of prepaid cards .
while currently the recycling of the specific numbers until after the expiry of the 90-day period , after which the sim forward to the network , so the newly could occur in the event of abandonment , in thailand to restore numbers already after ? ? days .
luxusní byt v novostavbě na vinohradech has a pool and a hot tub on the terrace .
why did you choose new flat ?
we were looking for a carefree apartment , where most of the care of the property with the administrator .
the condition was a sufficient number of parking spaces and the elevator in the house , which essentially disqualify earlier installation .
not to mention the problematic acoustics in old houses , problems with the floor , high energy performance and the like .
the condition was also a large terrace , which old buildings is not able to offer .
another interesting visitors find in the magazine modern apartment .
the whole interior decorator lenka langer suggested for you with my colleague camilla polákovou artiga from the studio .
why have you asked them ?
would you recommend cooperation with everyone ?
cooperation with the architect should be recommended to everyone , if the proposed apartment from the start , it is a very complex technical process .
the second plane design itself is the interior : designers , have a far better idea of the scale of possible materials and on the basis of the client , they are able to reconcile appropriately the interior .
with architect lenka langerovou worked with you on our mountain apartment , then based on the personal recommendation of another client , and , given that it all worked well , was the obvious choice for us in the reconstruction of our new apartment in vinohrady .
what were your practical and aesthetic requirements ?
we wished we were generous společensko-obytný space with adequate facilities for a family of four as a modern , but not cold interior .
the priority was to achieve interconnection apartment with terraces and implement smart household .
and of course it was necessary to keep the quality of implementation .
you left it to the professionals , you interfere with the final shape of the interior ?
all applications , including technical drawings and samples of the material we approve the proposal , however , always came from architects .
in the beginning , we have set ourselves , what we expect out of design , and showed some elements of the interior , which we would like to include in the proposal , for example , carpets or paintings .
i think that &amp; apos ; s our collection of mostly českých autorů comprising of karl malich , charles i ... dried , václava Špály or designer otto gutfreund helped orient our taste .
also the combination of black , white , and walnut was the idea of the architect as well as individual pieces of furniture , walls , floor , lighting , rugs , textiles , art , etc . , whether all of the above matches , we jointly verify using visualisation .
there have been some complications in the implementation , for which you had to give up the original ideas or , on the contrary , to concede to the new ?
perhaps only in the initial stage of the project , when we arrived at the building at the time , when was the first time possible to climb to the height of our floor , and discovered that the projections that we planned , in fact blocking the surrounding buildings .
that &amp; apos ; s when we disposition overnight , fundamentally changed .
on the kitchen counter and lining the walls was used granite .
the interior of the then prevailing wooden surfaces with leather upholstery , for example , restaurant and bar stools norma from arperu .
how would you describe the interior ?
are there any changes or is something that you would otherwise have wanted today ?
as i see it , it &amp; apos ; s a modern , airy interior , which mainly serve their purpose .
the changes we are not going , most of the adjustment after moving in , took place in the plane of the shielding and the home terraces .
perhaps the only complaint is on the floor , when our walnut wood shows as too delicate to households with a dog .
the word architektek , ing. arch . lenka langer and mga . kamila hornychová , author of realisation .
the apartment is on the top floor of the new building , because it was possible to carry out in connection with the construction of a completely new disposal solutions and a few other adjustments .
the interior is an important element of the location of the light-guide into the ceiling of the corridor and the main bathroom .
that we got daily light into the darker area apartment .
also direct access from the main bathroom on the roof terrace to the pool from usspa is one of the building works , which was very valuable for the function of the whole apartment .
there is also a pool and a hot tub .
in comparison with the french the negative you &amp; apos ; re not , says a muslim living in prague .
you come from france .
where &amp; apos ; d you live before you moved to prague ?
my parents are originally from algeria .
i was born in the south of france , near the spanish border .
pretty much i moved .
i lived in toulouse , lyon and marseille .
in france i &amp; apos ; m in journalism , which i then got to work in a magazine .
then why have you decided to move out of the country ?
i was starting to feel like that in france .
i just didn &amp; apos ; t want to live .
just because the atmosphere among the people .
it came to me that every french so negative .
people in france are generally negative sentiment , but the last time it got worse .
it &amp; apos ; s interesting that you mention just negativity .
some people actually like that assesses the czech nature .
believe me , compared to the french negative aren &amp; apos ; t you .
for some people , it may not be so , when they come to france , because it &amp; apos ; s not so much as tourists .
but for me , it was too much .
the big issue is the money .
people have the feeling that they have little money , while the minimum wage in france is € ? , ? ? ? , which i think is enough .
now there is also a problem with the behaviour of people against muslims .
that , to me , is totally incomprehensible .
for example , in the street , in which i lived , to me the neighbor started to look through my fingers because i &amp; apos ; m muslim .
as if i were some sort of evil .
that &amp; apos ; s why i &amp; apos ; m in france didn &amp; apos ; t feel well .
my family there but stayed .
so you decided to go to another country .
why did you choose the czech republic ?
i was looking for a job , basically anywhere else , and i found a vacancy at air france here in prague .
i confess that i didn &amp; apos ; t know at the beginning of the prague at all .
the czech republic i knew something , daddy told me about what happened in czechoslovakia , but even i didn &amp; apos ; t know what to expect from prague .
now i &amp; apos ; ve been here three years and i can &amp; apos ; t imagine that i didn &amp; apos ; t live here .
it was a big difference when you moved from france to prague ?
just because of a completely different atmosphere .
maybe it &amp; apos ; s that i don &amp; apos ; t speak english , so i can &amp; apos ; t pick up any negative reaction or abuse , but i have a feeling that there are people more free .
that i can do anything , to dress in any way and no one will judge me .
in france you always get uncomfortable watching , when you have a special clothing and the like .
in prague , i started to feel really free .
pražané se don &amp; apos ; t care about such things to me .
where do you work now ?
after employment in air france when i worked for a travel web site .
then we &amp; apos ; re even , with one friend started a website , on which people offer and are looking for shared housing .
so far we only in prague , but we want it to extend to the whole of central europe .
you &amp; apos ; re in prague , a czech friends ?
i have two very close friends who are czechs half , and two more friends czech .
i have to say , another concern is that the czechs had more .
they won &amp; apos ; t let anyone get so close .
that &amp; apos ; s quite different from where i grew up .
to the south , all hugs and kisses on the cheek .
here , it &amp; apos ; s different , but i understand that it &amp; apos ; s a cultural thing , so i &amp; apos ; m trying to adapt .
you mentioned that you do not speak english .
it &amp; apos ; s for you , the language barrier problem ?
rather have it in prague pretty easy , because everyone here speaks english .
even at convenience stores or in food .
i &amp; apos ; d like to learn english , but i don &amp; apos ; t have much time .
and that , that everyone can at least communicate in english , don &amp; apos ; t have such a need to learn the language quickly .
and every time i have a problem , it &amp; apos ; s with someone who can help me .
did you meet with some negative reactions ?
maybe because you &amp; apos ; re a muslim ?
in fact , no .
maybe it &amp; apos ; s also that i work in an international environment , which is more tolerant .
one experience i can think of .
my manager , Češka , told me once about the french football team and she said something along the lines of : it &amp; apos ; s not french , but africans .
well , i &amp; apos ; m a little offended .
but that should anyone have a problem with that , i &amp; apos ; m a muslim , it &amp; apos ; s never happened to me before .
and that , despite the fact that my colleague once said to some anti-muslim demonstrations .
he told me not to go to the centre , i will be there .
protimuslimské demonstration in part related to the terrorist attacks .
what do you think of the current situation ?
are you afraid something like that was going to be like in paris , nice or brussels can also be in prague ?
in prague , i feel safe .
but the problem is that in this day and age anything can happen anywhere .
until recently i couldn &amp; apos ; t imagine that would be something like that happened in france .
and it &amp; apos ; s not just the muslims .
moreover , islam does not recognise any violence .
for me , people who kill , are not muslims .
the koran says that person has no right to kill , because there is no god .
how do you feel about it when the terrorists steel your faith ?
it &amp; apos ; s very hard .
i feel shame and guilt , even though i didn &amp; apos ; t feel it at all .
i try not to watch too much violence on the news , but every time i read something , i felt the need to apologize for something that is not really my fault .
i &amp; apos ; m a different person , so why should i apologize for terrorists ?
we are gathered in the town square jiřího z poděbrad .
on wednesday , the czech muslims along with christians demonstrated against violence .
have you notice that ?
i didn &amp; apos ; t know that .
but as i understand it , these people feel the need to prove that it does not agree with violence .
i don &amp; apos ; t think that would be something they had to do .
why should they feel guilty for something they did not cause ?
do you meet in prague , as well as to other muslims ?
my colleagues are from , for example , egypt and other muslim countries .
they are a little bit more religious than i am , so we &amp; apos ; ve got some pretty fierce debate about islam , because we see him a little differently .
i come from france , so i &amp; apos ; ve been through different training , they should be taught islam in school .
we have different approaches , but respect each other .
people sometimes associate islam with subordinate status of women .
how do you feel about that ?
i don &amp; apos ; t feel for the underdog in any case .
rather the opposite .
i &amp; apos ; m a woman , i have the strength .
it has to do with the fact that you don &amp; apos ; t wear any head covering .
for example , the hijab ?
and sign on it especially the way i was raised .
my mother , for example , is really principled muslim .
they pray five times a day , but just don &amp; apos ; t wear a headscarf .
you always taught me that religion is a purely personal thing .
it is up to each , how it interprets .
when one reads the koran , he should be on the stuff you make up your own mind .
so when i read a passage in the koran that says that god said the prophet , to hide his wife in front of the other , and i said : i &amp; apos ; m not the prophet &amp; apos ; s wife , so why should i hide ?
on the other hand , i respect that , and if the journey to iran or saudi arabia , where headscarves require , so i &amp; apos ; ll take it .
are you planning to stay in prague ?
so far , yes .
nowhere else i didn &amp; apos ; t feel so good .
for a moment i thought about poland , but in prague , i &amp; apos ; m great .
even i can imagine , too , that i was raising my own children .
prague is the ideal city to me for it .
Čeští muslims along with christians demonstrated against violence .
jachtařku kozelskou fenclovou wind gusted in rio on the grant .
friday &amp; apos ; s journey at sea in brazil &amp; apos ; s rio de jachtařce czech out gay spritely veronica kozelské fenclové .
in class laser radial moved before the final two rozjížďkami to tenth place .
that would ensure Češce participation in the final run .
packages collectibles like pokémon .
they want to compete with airlines .
the idea to use the already scheduled routes for the transport of consignments is a television director matthew fox and manager of prague &amp; apos ; s music club marek greger .
with the idea of life three applications with different geographical reach .
national application i &amp; apos ; m escorting we launched in may .
at the moment it &amp; apos ; s recorded a thousand cities and we continue to expand the network .
in the czech republic it first , we want to learn , than to more focus on abroad , says in an interview for idnes.cz , years old manager .
as the app i &amp; apos ; m escorting works and who it would benefit ?
you drop it and free you sign up .
then you can specify the route and how much money you can get and how much you want for it .
someone back in the day to demand the transfer .
when he meets the route and time of service , paired with it and both come mutual notification .
in that moment to open a chat room , where the pair set up the transfer .
how many people would you estimate had to register , so that every package always found his courier ?
the ideal situation i don &amp; apos ; t know , i can &amp; apos ; t guess how many are registered and how many journeys is needed to cover entirely optimal , and each menu paired up with demand .
the main moves it &amp; apos ; s working and it &amp; apos ; s logically easier than to be on the road between the villages .
the more people , the greater the potential speed and accuracy .
people build confidence yet either , and find that no one escapes with the package .
so far you have not had to deal with a case like this ?
how many users is the service two months after launch ?
right now we have about 5 to 6 thousand people who create way .
we consider that success , and we believe they will flirt with another one .
there &amp; apos ; s no way that will be chargeable to the consignor wait too long ?
we hope that we will be in competition for large conglomerates just for this reason that we are able to deliver the item must be on the same day and at a fraction of the price .
for large companies to pay for the service of up to two hours for several thousand .
there will be a hundred or less , because that &amp; apos ; s the way it &amp; apos ; s anyone &amp; apos ; s business .
they should be the traditional carriers in the future worry about potential loss of customers ?
we hope that it will be so .
the market has huge potential , feeds a huge transnational carriers , as well as the commercial chain , where everyone started shopping , and gradually found that quality does not correspond to what they pay for .
no one wants to find a note in my mailbox with a message that you have to pick up the package at a branch , and the day it first after 19 .
by that time i had a package for six hours needed and waited at home , because it was important .
we want better , faster , and functional service that there will be no one to upset and will send a signal to try and compete .
marek greger ( 41 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ) and matthew fox ( 39 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ) .
neither one ever not in the field of information technology .
marek greger works as the manager of a music club , matthew fox as a television director .
in 2014 , they started to prepare the application shippansee ltd , which is used to transport packages already scheduled journey between global cities , especially on a plane .
in 2015 , the specified project processing company , which created the application , or the need for mall.cz jobs.cz Čsfd .
programming took three quarters of the year and the administration have placed on the market in march 2016 .
an app i &amp; apos ; m escorting started in december last year and started this year in may .
this is a local version of shippansee adjusted for the czech market .
the application and mesíkem mesíkem profi develop since january this year and made available to users at the end of july 2016 .
the intention from the start was to make all of these applications , which one day may merge in one .
in the czech republic want to refine the app and then in cooperation with a strong investor focus more on the global market .
the economy is the issue and this is a service type of airbnb or uber .
you have concerns about activity in the area , of which no one yet so can &amp; apos ; t say where the line is , and where the sharing economy ?
it &amp; apos ; s the same , just a different product .
it is clear to us that if it &amp; apos ; s a success , and we &amp; apos ; ll get this up , we &amp; apos ; ll be another thorn in through the grey economy .
but even if someone saves and someone makes , is not intended to circumvent the financial authorities and tax controls .
each user , whether on one side or the other , will be encouraged to danil their income revenue out of it , if you will .
what makes you think service has such great potential ?
the sender převozce and save money , and reduce costs for the trip .
that &amp; apos ; s the powerful idea that connects the interest on both sides .
in the age of social networks , which divide people , we want to make this , on the other hand , was .
they may be nice stories , people are happy to help someone and they &amp; apos ; ll tell you all about it .
maybe someone gets forgotten glasses , keys or pills .
people in my personal approach is missing for a long time , about this app , we say that it is a service people to the people .
how do you guarantee that a courier with a package neprchne ?
each user applications , together with the registration by scanning the id card and banking , payment or credit card .
these are channels that give the service i man credibility .
couriers also collect stars on the basis of an assessment of the senders .
we offer the insurance details even match .
for insured package in the case of loss of or damage to the courier , but does not assume liability under criminal law , responsibility for the content , if it &amp; apos ; s in something illegal , and i don &amp; apos ; t know about it .
if the police stop him and finds in the sealed package in his trunk gun or ten pounds of hashish , criminal liability on the sender .
no danger of misuse of the sensitive data from the database ?
registered participants are dohledatelní if necessary , by an administrative authority , which alone will be able to see it , even we ourselves are able to see them , data are protected against misuse .
how much money gets after the successful delivery of the consignment into the hand of the courier ?
the courier determines the price and gets the whole of the amount you say .
odesilateli to charge a few percent extra for mediation .
this money is our profit , but it &amp; apos ; s only a couple of percent , because we want to push volume .
courier too no one can accuse you of the consignment , if it is actually delivered , taken over the service is checked using qr codes .
are there any restrictions ?
whether in relation to size or content of the package ?
move , you can do anything .
we have three size , a little like a cube of butter , high school as a carton of eggs and a case of beer .
there is no further restrictions and if someone instead of in the car , take them to the fridge .
plus the app is possible for the sender to package a picture , so a courier sees what he wants it to .
case you don &amp; apos ; t even have to pick up , if you don &amp; apos ; t want to hide the contents .
a missed sweatshirt stick courier to hand and that &amp; apos ; s it .
who came up with the idea and how long did it take to start the service ?
a friend had an idea more than two years ago , when i paid it much attention .
then he showed me a demo application transnational , which targets mainly on the passenger plane .
in that moment , i told him that i don &amp; apos ; t look for the investor , but i would like and give the savings .
next year , insisted the development , than we are about the whole product further strengthening more founded in london firm shippansee ltd .
this isn &amp; apos ; t the version , which is now mainly focus .
no , marketing , we focus on the czech republic , where we &amp; apos ; re trying to use dovychytat , because the whole thing was in labor and it &amp; apos ; s still what to address and improve .
we &amp; apos ; re trying to respond to feedback from customers and foreign market currently so much anymore .
we know it &amp; apos ; s a long shot , but no rush , we want to create a really good product for people .
shippansee ltd was basic and most expensive application , another two were kind of upgrade .
i &amp; apos ; m escorting was created when we said that the segment could be far more interesting and that &amp; apos ; s in the czech republic at least we will learn .
the third application mesíkem is local , for the city .
he can send a package to the exact address , but also on the other side of the world .
it works for the sender as i &amp; apos ; m escorting , but the difference is that you can see in her as a courier consignments in the form of points on the map that are closest to you , thanks geolokátoru in cell phone .
the application for couriers , who do they want to live , we have named mesíkem teach .
so can anyone really make some extra cash by the city to pick up packages ?

thirty years ago , when i left to retire , his wife , after ? ? years of marriage , found about twenty years younger man , our neighbor .
i knew it from the beginning - first for him obviously trying for a long time , then got together .
he &amp; apos ; s such a big guy , about her type , because with a similar dated even before me .
absolutely strapping man .
in those first days , she even had a voice , a girl &amp; apos ; s in love with the voice .
but when i told her that i know what &amp; apos ; s going on , then deny it .
i watched it all .
he then went from work regularly at ? : ? ? in the fourth , and she always left the three on the purchase .
every day , trying to make him at least .
later i found out that they meet in his house , in the laundry room .
how many times have i knew that &amp; apos ; s where they are .
i &amp; apos ; ve got the keys , his mind was made up , there &amp; apos ; s a catch .
but i don &amp; apos ; t know why , in the end i always stayed at home .
i &amp; apos ; ve never failed to go , do the decisive step .
maybe you &amp; apos ; ll laugh at me , but i believe that my wife was controlling his mind .
soon , i found out that i was manipulated , that i &amp; apos ; m going to do what she wants .
and i really did .
maybe i &amp; apos ; m just such a wimp .
the neighbor when i suggested he knows that as well .
i was such a jerk that i never asked them what to do .
i was afraid that if it all collapsed , so that will be bad .
that &amp; apos ; s in the family , all the hits , something her only daughter .
so i &amp; apos ; m always put off , on and on and on .
one day i followed him to the apartment that i needed something in the laundry room .
he went there with me , and i told him that i received an anonymous tip that he was seeing my wife and it &amp; apos ; s the most obvious thing .
i asked him what he has to say for himself .
he stood there , shrugged , looking into the ground and didn &amp; apos ; t say a word .
then i also in that time , once met his wife on the way out of the store .
i told her , but she didn &amp; apos ; t believe it at all .
she didn &amp; apos ; t actually respond and also didn &amp; apos ; t tell me anything .
no one said anything to me then .
i &amp; apos ; m the kind of guy who didn &amp; apos ; t go out much , never a problem to meet someone , let alone find a woman .
so the divorce i hadn &amp; apos ; t really thought about it .
i &amp; apos ; m still relying on that , one day it &amp; apos ; s over .
i thought i &amp; apos ; d forgive her everything and life will go on .
that wasn &amp; apos ; t the case .
and i was with all that in essence never equal .
to this day , i have it in me .
i used it often enough , but in the end i gave it for peace .
he still lives in the house next door , and i continued to live with her .
it &amp; apos ; s just that it &amp; apos ; s more than my wife , my housekeeper .
dom always made everything - cooking , washing , cleaning .
he &amp; apos ; s hardworking .
he &amp; apos ; s always trying to me , not to have another reason to complain .
and you might say , that is also good .
but sometimes i want to caress , hug and she won &amp; apos ; t .
we are together , we go on walks and to purchase , and everyone thinks we have a happy marriage .
but she once said that she never loved me .
that had me and the likes , but that she didn &amp; apos ; t love me .
and i can see that his loves , it &amp; apos ; s her god .
and i &amp; apos ; m tired of this life .
even then , when it started , and i &amp; apos ; m very badly , i once said that i don &amp; apos ; t want to live , and i asked what she &amp; apos ; d say if i ended it .
i wanted to see if you would agree with this or not .
and that &amp; apos ; s what i wanted to hear from her : yes or no .
but she thought , and finally said : &amp; quot ; but there &amp; apos ; s plenty of room . &amp; quot ;
the prime minister manuel valls wants to set up a new french islamic foundation , which should serve as a bridge between the state and its muslim citizens .
after the terrorist attacks , france is stepping up the fight against radical islamists , and the assistance to the government and local muslim minority .
&amp; quot ; if muslims themselves will not help the state against those who undermine public freedom , it will be increasingly difficult for france to guarantee freedom of religion , &amp; quot ; said prime minister manuel valls .
he intends to ensure that the country preached only spiritual educated in france .
stop also wants funding mosques from abroad , with the money often coming preachers inoculated jihad .
by october , the french prime minister valls wants to establish a new islamic foundation , which should serve as a bridge between the state and its muslim citizens .
the new institution will replace the current french foundation for islam , founded in 2005 by then prime minister dominique de villepin .
even then , should contribute to the transparency of financial flows between the mosques and countries that their construction financing .
soon it but hit the internal contradictions , and therefore never worked properly .
&amp; quot ; it &amp; apos ; s a total failure , &amp; quot ; said valls .
the new foundation will likely former defense and interior minister jean-pierre chevènement , who is known as a supporter of a secular state .
in france , operates roughly 2,500 mosques and modliteben , about 120 of them serve radical islamism .

this week , the jihadist cleric also german police .
imams allegedly recruiting fighters for the islamic state .
one of them ran the space , where religious allegedly radicalized and later attacked the sikh temple in essen .
right after the attacks on charlie hebdo in january 2015 , in france , the debate about the new institution , which will replace the defunct foundation .
all spurred further terrorist attacks which , in the name of islamic state , the radical islamists did .
the new foundation will have two main tasks - to ensure the financing of mosques from domestic sources and also supervise the imams .
it &amp; apos ; s not yet clear where to obtain finance , although he is considering several proposals .
one of them is a special levy on halal food , namely , in particular , on the meat from the slaughtered according to islamic principles .
this tax would , in practice , pay the sellers of halal food , and that the granting of an authorisation .
some of the money would have went right to the budget of the foundation .
the contribution of 10 to 20 euros they could also pay french pilgrims , to mecca .
every year they have the traditional pilgrimage to saudi arabia , moving from france about 30 thousand .
in the french mosques should moreover only preachers , who went through training programmes at universities .
this would be their sermons should be in accordance with democracy .
the government also shut down the radical mosques .
&amp; quot ; since december , we &amp; apos ; ve closed ? ? and others will follow , &amp; quot ; said interior minister bernard cazeneuve .
&amp; quot ; in france , there is no place for those who preach hatred and do not respect our country &amp; apos ; s principles , such as equality between men and women , &amp; quot ; he said .

helen glover and heather stanningovou to victory on the rowing race inspired the coach &amp; apos ; s fight with cancer
at these games won &amp; apos ; t find a more emotional baby - and that &amp; apos ; s saying something .
from the first frame to the last , during 220 trestajících breaths in history found helen glover and heather stanningová more importance in their golden moment in estacio de lagoa .
even at the oars were two , three votes were in the boat when the ship through the water toward the second olympic gold in a row in the women &amp; apos ; s pairs , was with them in the ship &amp; apos ; s voice still present coach robin williams . they are the first women in the history of british sport , which achieved such an outcome .
their dominance was absolute , it was their 39th race in which remained impressive records .
that &amp; apos ; s what we see - two excellent athletes , how the surface of the water flies with the grace of a swan - does not reflect the nature of the victory .
for every gold medals from rowing &amp; apos ; s battalion of hands in which , little by little , mean difference . and no hands were not assisted by more than his coach , who 30 months ago he didn &amp; apos ; t know whether to this day live when he was diagnosed with cancer .
in his words it was uncertain .
i &amp; apos ; ve suffered cancer of the bladder , which can be operated on , and i had this operation .
without surgery , anything might have happened .
it would be very , very bad situation .
rather it will change your point of view .
the cancer was found williams in december 2013 .
happiness for the whole of the trio was that he could get treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , and so cut the blackout to a minimum - as far as we can in such circumstances .
i needed to make money , so i had to give up quickly .
that was the impetus .
i was in the hospital , and i went around the room - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet , at a time when they said that several steps .
that &amp; apos ; s how it started .
rowing alone is the way , but this was a little more challenging .
immediately after the victory , their first thoughts on williams , who was very nervous this morning , he spoke less than usual , trying to manage their own anxiety .
stanningová , captain of the royal artillery regiment , which has a mission in afghanistan , said : &quot; this week i was with emotion at the bottom , maybe it &amp; apos ; s a little extreme , but it means so much &quot; .
once again this highlights how much this means to me , how much we have worked with helen and robin , too .
until now it was three fantastic years with helen and robin .
no robin , we have not been anyone , so he owns a huge thank you , he &amp; apos ; s the best coach in the world .
i couldn &amp; apos ; t wish for a better person to train , or a better coach .
helen glover and heather stanningová lost only one race in five years .
the pair put on an astonishing rhythm , to which their rivals could not match .
even in the final 500 meters , when it began to approach the crews from new zealand and denmark , should stanningová glover with a very big margin .
up we were at any given point in time .
helen was screaming : &quot; don &amp; apos ; t stop , don &amp; apos ; t stop &quot; .
it &amp; apos ; s really important not to get carried away .
we had a good start and we achieve something vicious famózního .
netěšily on tonight &amp; apos ; s fireworks , just like boats , well we wanted to go out and win the race , which we did .
the pair will take a year to decide , before they decide what to do next .
glover is getting married next week , her intended is a television adventurer steve backshall .
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
i didn &amp; apos ; t mean to say that this will be my last race .
that would be too much pressure .
in london , it took about six months before they find out i &amp; apos ; m an olympic champion .
it was all so new and i was so stressed out .
it took about four minutes .
i have a much better feeling , &quot; she said .

prison ?
more like let people free , says the hunter taximafie rubeš to the landmark prosecution .
six cab drivers and former official of the city government in prague are , as stated , thu defendants .
you &amp; apos ; ve made a number of stories in which you reveal the fraudulent practices and those who have to be in the group , which would happen in court .
you faced because of a few nasty fights with the players .
how much is for you the news of the prosecution of members of the organised group of revolutionary ?
i was expecting some kind of court probably will .
i &amp; apos ; m especially curious about the judgment .
but i don &amp; apos ; t think he should be in prison .
it &amp; apos ; s no use .
primarily they should return all the stolen money .
and they should return them so that they will be driving all the people for free .
that &amp; apos ; s a pretty fancy solutions .
does this mean that any penalty notice as sufficiently effective ?
for me , it is sufficient that some of them are so frightened that they don &amp; apos ; t do the job anymore .
for example , one does a waiter , another pizza delivery and one totally blew it .
the defendants can , in theory , get two to eight years in prison .
do you think that &amp; apos ; s an adequate rate ?
in general , i have a problem with imprisonment .
i consider it a bad punishment .
lock someone up in prison , especially in this case , is nonsense .
such people should return the company , what took her .
a quarter century is committed to , that our country destroyed the name and dirty robbing people .
let &amp; apos ; s now make a good card , and are people for free .
i can &amp; apos ; t imagine it any other way .
it would work as a community service .
as someone go pick up garbage , they would get a free car and take people in prague .
no , really , i think in the end they get the condition and they don &amp; apos ; t care .
they &amp; apos ; ll find another way to cheat on somewhere .
he studied at the film academy miroslav ondříček v písku and subsequently na univerzitě tomáše bati ve zlíně .
it belongs to the people who started in the czech republic with virálními videos and videos for the web .
he works as an editor for the internet tv stream.cz , where he is involved in a number of programmes , is now preparing a show prague guide , which is intended primarily for a foreign audience .
to those rubes in the form of short story tells how the services in prague would rather avoid , and what , on the other hand , is free to use .
before filming the series with names how did , city fraud ? , life in the lap of luxury , enough ! and praha vs. money .
in the prosecution &amp; apos ; s refer to them as the organised group .
the police followed her for several months .
can such a network of fraudulent taxi drivers described as mafia ?
they are such adorable mobsters , not like that , as we know from the godfather .
it is rather the mobsters - juniors , but organized are definitely .
it &amp; apos ; s just that watching each other štafly ( cab ) .
prague is the whole pieced .
i tracked , for example , that the main train station to doesn &amp; apos ; t like with the paris , paris again doesn &amp; apos ; t like with taxi drivers waiting at karlovy lázně ( disco club )
everyone just watch your place and each of the group is organised .
it &amp; apos ; s obviously a complex web .
obžalovaných is but together just seven people , six taxi drivers and one former official of the municipality , which warn the driver controls .
as you say yourself , the adverse effect from the streets .
what percentage of between pražskými fraudsters in your estimation , taxi service then ?
it &amp; apos ; s a very small percentage .
the worst ones are still on the street .
i am talking for instance about lesha ryjáčkovi .
this is a man who is actually dangerous - in your car driving kel-light , and every friday and saturday at the charles bridge and the people .
when was the last time i was with him , asked me for seven hundred for three kilometres .
the police for some reason failed .
they chose only a few people from the whole of a large group .
the same situation is in other locations .
obžalobou seven people therefore hard to eradicate already famous prague abuse that appears to be a much larger dimensions .
completely useless , of course , it &amp; apos ; s not .
it will help , but the evil is eradicated , that &amp; apos ; s true .
they cab drivers who rob foreign tourists , still in the same places that you showed in reports , the charles bridge or the paris street ?
yes , that &amp; apos ; s right .
in these locations is every day and every day violate the decree .
it ignores how the city police , the city hall .
it &amp; apos ; s not even kocourkov , but total indifference .
business prague taxi drivers in numbers
still , some of them , even if it &amp; apos ; s just a part of the group , they get to court .
it &amp; apos ; s been a breakthrough .
i have to ask : do you feel vindicated ?
if i take it as an accomplishment , that would be wrong , because my goal was , is and always will be , to the centre of prague .
and though i have the feeling that there is a need to have a little bit better , i will continue .
we need to push on the door from the other side .
although there remain a thief , we &amp; apos ; d still have to do something to remove him .
with that , cannot be satisfied .
but it is not so , of course , there are more .
you &amp; apos ; re trying to still confront directly in taxis ?
sometimes i do a test drive , and i have to say , it &amp; apos ; s still bad .
just last week , i caught one taxi driver , by the way , from the same group , and was very surprised to see me .
he tacked on 560 kroner for two miles , then claimed that it was the amount of czk 56 ( used the trick with the decimal point ) .
he had a receipt , the cops came and this driver was so cute and cheeky , he still went for these police officers and asked them , when someone finally put those 56 crowns .
a similar case .
the taxi driver on the meter taped a decimal point and robbed the tourists by 357 crowns .
in fact , the impudence of fraudulent taxi drivers did not after you in their footage showed the faces of those who charge ridiculous amounts for a short ride ?
their arrogance is still incredible .
how is that a taxi driver domáhajícím with 56 crowns ?
the police sent him away with that , with him at a place they cannot discuss , because it put the receipt .
and it will be , i think , the problem and the court of ( six taxi drivers and one exúředníka ) .
on the one hand , there will be some taxi driver with their bills , on the other side of the police .
but according to the ruling of the supreme administrative court must not magistrate used secret recordings from the vehicle cab services as evidence in court .
when i was filming parts of their fraud , me alone taxi drivers on this precedent .
i &amp; apos ; ve always wanted to use the footage , but only in the story .
you have concerns that this could protect the fact even before the court ?
i hope any judge will understand that no cab driver couldn &amp; apos ; t drive for six or ten crowns per kilometre , because it would save my life .
you were talking about the shirt with the decimal point , which in particular before foreign clients underwater taxi drivers are .
it &amp; apos ; s still current , or they fear this trick after the publication of your stories continue to use ?
i think we &amp; apos ; re this trick , on the other hand , the show is broadcasted comercials .
i recently went with one taxi driver , he bragged to me that he &amp; apos ; s the honest taxi driver .
then i noticed that the black cardboard taped to the side of the meter .
when i ask him , what &amp; apos ; s he got there , he told me : &amp; quot ; you know what it is . &amp; quot ;
when the taxikáře-podvodníky too didn &amp; apos ; t work fine , it may impress the court a warning on them with their colleagues ?
it &amp; apos ; s not something that can be deterred from fraud ?
did you talk about that , do you think they find a way to cheat , always .
i think nothing can deter them .
but someone is one of those places may push .
and that &amp; apos ; s fair taxi drivers who should be doing more to keep them out of there really got away .
from my experience , i have to say , your fair taxi drivers in prague , fortunately .
but they have the appetite to go against those who undermined their services ?
the taste they have , but they lack um .
he can &amp; apos ; t go in too and he can &amp; apos ; t exactly say what they wanted .
when held a rally ( due to across-the-board restrictions from the mayor &amp; apos ; s office adrian krnáčové ) , however very clearly what they really want .
he said that protest against uber , they just want to have the same conditions as is this service , then claimed that they want more than uber .
as it turned out , was just a block of prague and it comes from only the best possible advertising for uber .
how would you evaluate the overall approach of the prague city hall in the solution to the problem of overcharging fare ?
you see , i had to jump in when the criminal police , something to be worked out .
the magistrate was to short .
there was a mole who leaked the information , that is to say , the department taxi carried out his work for years for nothing .
hopefully , the official in charge of the last checks all the lost control , to realize what he &amp; apos ; s done .
that to me is the worst .
i was even with him on one control , which i found out later from their schedule .
since publishing the last episodes of tv shows has been for several months now .
what is the response ?
i think especially for foreign viewers , than is actually a series of the most focused .
i have friends here from abroad , they play the videos .
and then we go after the old town square , is a surprise , it &amp; apos ; s the same people who are seen on camera , really is .
infamous pražské celebrities .
but seriously .
build a fence around them , for the people watching .
the museum of communism , right on the street .
my last question is clear .
you drive a cab , if you need ?
sure .
i ride to the services , for which i don &amp; apos ; t have to pay in cash , but the card .
i use services such as uber or liftago , where there is no possibility of fraud .
it is but also many dispatchings , which are fair .
on the street , i took a cab from then on only once .
the driver of the car , after i said : &amp; quot ; wow , you have some nerve . &amp; quot ;
bém disguised as an italian tourist .
the fraudulent taxi drivers said in 2005 .
former mayor pavel bém in the same year set out to control the ride in the guise of an italian tourist and right on the first try it shorted the driver $ ? ? ? .
the editor rubeš had a worse experience .
the drivers taxis charge him for the ride from the old town to the wenceslas square 820 kroner , which is based on some 195 crowns per kilometre , as calculated by the creators of the story .
prague city hall , set a maximum price of czk 28 per km .
in the filmed story are also another surprising amount : e.g. dvoukilometrová journey from the streets of paris to the joinery installation was a tourist 400 crowns .
expensive ride , also provide taxi drivers waiting in karlovo bridge .
a ride on the angel , which is 2.5 miles , they charge even six hundred crowns .
the marble wash mostly clean water , most of it without the chemistry and the longer , the better .
impurities are going well of him , even if he sometimes has to be dirt to put down the scalpel , it must be from the folds of his .
it &amp; apos ; s not easy , and it isn &amp; apos ; t that fast , approached his job a paintings conservator vanessa trost of oldøichova v hájích .
hats off to her : tombstone is obestavěný scaffolding , after which it must be countless times to get up and come down again .
&amp; quot ; restoration should be careful , patient and unassuming on the work environment , &amp; quot ; she said .
on frýdlantsku restaurátorská it is far from her first job .
thanks to her , the recovery such as stone elements in the rear facades frydlant city hall , also restored statues of saints in the loser magdalene , holy jana nepomuckého ve frýdlantě , pieta in frydlant okružní street at ve frýdlantu atlanty or in front of the spa v novém městě pod smrkem .
with recovery tombstone melchior , christopher and catherine from redernu se ve frýdlantu started already in 2011 .
now , purifies the surface rock elements from the impurities and crusting , loose stone to ensure against collapse and shift ; either will be anchored to the wall or to each other .
he is also treatment and preservation of the surface .
the inscriptions on the tomb &amp; apos ; s beams again .
&amp; quot ; then he starts to gilding on the marble in pure culinary gold leaf , &amp; quot ; said officer national monuments městského úřadu ve frýdlantu věra sobotová .
in the past , there are no records of that tombstone went through some repairs .
on closer inspection they holes drilled in the marble columns .
they are hundreds of years old and the decoration of the headstone .
he was richly decorated with , unfortunately , after the raid the swedes for the thirty years &amp; apos ; war was gone .
literally tombstone to trim , said sobotová .
in church finding holy cross are conservatives with a slight exaggeration as at home .
after flooding in 2010 was needed to fix the headstones , which were under water , restored to the font , the mural in the tomb , and now the headstone .
&amp; quot ; we &amp; apos ; d like to in the future into stained glass , &amp; quot ; she told sobotová .
the church is otherwise in very good condition , every year in maintenance and repair our money .
restoration work on restoring redernovského headstone will be a total of 128 thousand crowns .
they will be funded by subsidies , the town in this part of the recovery will not be putting any of her money .
a hundred thousand crowns goes from winning at regionals competition historical city in 2015 , the other 28 thousand crowns is the contribution of the ministry of culture , said mayor dan ramzer frýdlant .
the release of the winnings on the restoration council decided the headstone .
the views of experts on the future development of the selected foreign markets pursued through the indices and compared with the czech capital market ( px ) in the term of one month and a half .
in markets dominated by low volatility and growth .
who would have even the beginning of the year , he said .
the us s &amp; amp ; p500 index , which in february was 12 % correction is now at a new historical highs , and since the start of the year he has 7 percent .
again , so confirms the iron rule that traders would never go against the long term interest of the central banks , which in the end has always reached their .
in a situation where us stocks are at an all-time high so again disappearing volatility , which is currently the lowest since 2014 , when the markets happy and without fear grew thanks to quantitative easing of the us federal reserve and when , as now , the volatility index ( vix ) held steady below 12 percent .
and also to not .
although the fed markets in preparing for a gradual increase in interest rates , quantitative easing in europe and japan is in full swing , and in the past week in hand as well as the bank of england , which in the coming six months to buy bonds in the amount of 70 billion pounds .
the new wave of quantitative easing , thus pushing the already low yields even lower , and contributes to the almost complete elimination of risk and fear of the future .
how long this situation will last ?
this is , of course , the million-dollar question .
there are no risks , but at the moment the world economy is going through almost constant growth without major changes , the situation on the commodity market and in china is stabilising , and brexit has already basically is not the subject , so we shouldn &amp; apos ; t be too surprised if , in a similarly quiet scheme held us stocks continue .
too bad that juncker doesn &amp; apos ; t study klaus !
i am very glad that my friend michel barnier accepted this important and challenging task .
i wanted an experienced politician for this difficult job , said european commission chief juncker , when french policy ( a really experienced , since so many various supranational political functions , that a better example of the so-called &amp; apos ; european elite &amp; apos ; we find difficult ) was the main negotiator of the european commission conditions leaving great britain from the eu .
juncker &amp; apos ; s selection blew out of the hope that is in serious interest for the eu to look for with britain to form a future friendly coexistence .
but most of the british media has adopted the name of barnier , juncker as an act of war .
barnier is a european federalist .
britain hates .
as commissioner for the internal market ( 2009 - 2014 ) was in charge of the reform of the european banking law .
is it , as only he could take her : relentless enemy of the anglo-saxon model of capitalism and the free market concept .
an advocate of multilateral regulation was co-author of the concept of so-called banking union and with a grudge against anything that comes from the city , london &amp; apos ; s financial center , has pushed through legislation unduly tough regulation of the financial sector and services .
so this michel barnier , head of paris in a dispute with london , it will be hard , and probably by a ruthless negotiator .
i don &amp; apos ; t think that &amp; apos ; s good news .
as you recall , in this context , on the quiet and friendly division of the czechoslovak federation , to which many contributed to the balance sheet , insight , and empathy prime minister vaclav klaus .
i therefore today with the slovaks czechs may be the closest of friends and allies .
it &amp; apos ; s a pity juncker from vaclav klaus - at least in this - don &amp; apos ; t learn .
it would be to the benefit of all !
an earthquake around putin ?
the kremlin dismissed its close ivanova .
russian president vladimir putin on friday fired sergey ivanov was the chief of the presidential office .
his place will take over anton vajno .
it informed the russian media with reference to the notice of the press service of the kremlin .
however , putin hinted that ivan &amp; apos ; s released on his own recognizance .

it also announced that ivanov will be his special representative for ecology and transport .
the report on the exchange at the head of the president &amp; apos ; s administration , which will now be a current representative vajno ivanov , is considered to be quite surprising .
ivanov , who is 63 years old , is known as one of the closest associates of putin .
the former kgb officer in the past , for example , he appointed secretary of defense and deputy prime minister .
now leave and chair of a member of the president &amp; apos ; s security council .
ivanov at the meeting with putin , but stated that it was the length of stay at the head of the administration , chief of the state actually record .
he held it for four years and eight months .
in this context , in the 25 years since its establishment , in that capacity , he already had 11 people .

honey from london so misguided .

soupeřky were just better , bent knapková topinková before them .
she fought to the end and believed that at their fourth games between the top six .
the fight gave up until just before the goal .
i knew that the girls are in balance , that from that field may refer to anyone .
she surprised me chinese , that had such a finish .
and i thought that , i suppose to the finals .
unfortunately today rode the race , the 2011 world champion said .

both deal with the historically best výškařský performance under sedmiboje .
they sought to still jump to 201 centimeters , but failed .
german , russian , who is worse ?
looking beyond absurdity as follows the questions referred : the german company went through a profound sebereflexí , while russia is not .
in both major eurasian nations in the 20th century there were dictators , and were given the regimes that were inhumane , brutal and horrible .
the russian bolsheviks from 1917 to 1989 have contributed largely to the 94 million victims of communism , which states black book of communism , whether it was a targeted individual daily repression , famine , the incompetent leadership of war or inhumane experiments .
the nazis inhumane way they wiped out about 6 million jews and the total victims of world war ii , is estimated at $ 60 million .
on obsazovaných opouštěných territories or carry out atrocities the germans and soviets .
in germany or the ussr wasn &amp; apos ; t guilty just a few individuals , but a large part of the population is involved in these crimes , whether actively or passively , just cowardice or burying one &amp; apos ; s head in the sand .
it &amp; apos ; s not just the specifics of these nations , we czechs are similarly guilty .
in germany , immediately end the war came denacifikace , the nuremberg tribunal .
the most important thing , however , came later .
as the children grew up , they began to ask : father , grandfather , why were you involved in such atrocities ?
how could you !
this brought the real reflection and healing .
until recently , the german elites care more about the prosperity of the country , the eradication of poverty , the welfare of its citizens .
now they have other ( often naively idealistic ) objectives , but to them it &amp; apos ; s not about to connect back alsace-lorraine or someone - in return - militarily challenge - everyone recognises it .
after losing the cold war in russia to any great reflection .
the window of possible positive changes to definitively concluded at the turn of the millennium , when the former kgb officer ( sic ! ) vladimir putin .
often a criminal past is celebrated in russia today .
politikou putinovskéhu russia &amp; apos ; s revenge , the conquest of lost territory , the humiliation of the west .
health , prosperity and future of their own people not for věrchušku no value .
bij his , and to be afraid of .
i still believe that it &amp; apos ; s only those despotic regime decades ago , that the russians are not genetically or culturally inferior - meant to be asian ( myself ) tyranny .
who benefits the growth of tensions over crimea ?
the ukrainian army .
in the last days and hours of a worsening situation at the ukrainian-russian border in crimea .
to increase the tension is good for ?
after a long moment of relative calm again to a further worsening of relations between ukraine and russia .
the pretext of the ukrainian parties became a peninsula of crimea , which was accompanied by more than 2 years to russia and is part of its territory .
reports from both sides , of course , is contradictory and hard to independently verify , and so we have the option to only think about the old question of who it benefits ?
according to reports from moscow , the terrorist attacks on the crimea from the ukrainian side , which , of course , ukraine refuses and instead accuses the kremlin of provocation .
for information on the arrest of members of the ukrainian special forces on the territory of russia came from the case of pilot savčenkové already known the answer that they were supposedly on the territory of russia .
if we accept the ukrainian version of what would russia benefit from a deterioration of the situation around crimea ?
the simple answer is : nothing .
the escalation of tensions over crimea , russia can only damage , especially to the west in the form of a further tightening of sanctions and strengthen anti-russian campaign .
in the last year there has been against the immigration crisis into europe to retreat in attention from the situation in ukraine .
the ukrainian leadership has lost before their inhabitants already fully credit , when the current support for president poroshenko is around 15 % .
the economy of ukraine would already be bankrupt long ago if it wasn &amp; apos ; t for generous financial injections from the eu and imf .
in this situation needs ukrainian regime once again vigorously to attract attention to his country , so as to justify their requests for financial help and tried to improve his reputation before the voters in their own country .
president poroshenko and other members of the leadership of the force components once again want to show as strong men who are not afraid to stand up to the great russia .
we can only hope that all those who are trying to start a open conflict between ukraine and russia , and ultimately a huge responsibility for the lives not just of soldiers , but of all the ordinary people on either side of and stop in time their hostile actions .

to prison for money .
in scotland you can go behind bars without committing a crime .
many centuries was the village of inveraray regional centre and seat of the duke of argyll .
since the mid-18th century , held at city hall , the courts and the basement under the hall served as a local prison .
the conditions in which they lived , the convicts were pathetic and attempted to escape many prisoners .
a lot of them successfully .

&quot; animé &quot; effect on snapchat is criticized as an asian caricature
according to the snapchat filter is inspired by animé , but some observers say that is racially insensitive .
the app snapchat every day allows about 150 million users to change reality and play with identity in ways that borders on the absurd .
you can make yourself a pineapple , dog or figure , as if she got out of the image of roy lichtenstein .
filters are simple instruments that distort reality and every day will generate more than $ 30 million in improved selfies .
any mistake to publish , immediately .
snapchat filters in the past criticism with accusations that the app promotes blackfacing or that supports white skin tone as an ideal of beauty .
so when this week offered users filter , which had slanted eyes , crooked teeth and bloated face , some critics declared it racist caricature asians - &quot; yellowface &quot; .
and they asked whether these recurring issues do not point to a bigger problem - the problem with diversity .
on wednesday , the verge and motherboard wrote and news and outrage spread quickly and snapchat next day stated that function .
the company offered an explanation : filter was intended as a show of accounts animé characters , not as a caricature of the asians .
but observers who witnessed racism , filter remind painful stereotypes in action .
other blunt comparison with animé refused .
grace sparapani , a student of the american art from korea , whose tweet of the photo was widely shared , in an email , stated that the filter was &quot; the least harmful and embarrassing &quot; .
it added that &quot; it &amp; apos ; s hard to argue against the obvious comparison to asian caricature and effects filter .
it turns out that the filter is not only about the yellow face ( yellowface ) , but that yellow face is dragged into the contemptuous extreme .
snapchat isn &amp; apos ; t the only one with these cultural bounds exceeded .
it seems that american culture has an endless game of diversity and inclusion , from meeting rooms in corporations up hollywood and equipment , which all carry in our hands .
a huge number of young people on snapchat - who are more racially diverzifikovaní than their older partners - may mean that it may be expected that even greater sensitivity .
&quot; when one filter snapchat creates a picture , which is for any users of the offensive &quot; , said katie zhuová pětadvacetilá on thursday in an interview , &quot; just very difficult to do without these things today , as it was before &quot; .
katie zhuová , product manager and designer , who works for medium , on thursday decided to delete his account on snapchat and invited others to do the same .
in an article for medium and in conversation on the phone , it stated that it is convinced that the racist problems reflect the lack of diversity in recruitment of workers in snapchat .
katie zhuová criticised the vast white , male directors and ended with hash tag : # deletesnapchat .
&quot; it &amp; apos ; s either so that they don &amp; apos ; t have any diversity among employees and people of color , at the time when decisions about these things &quot; , said zhuová , who is chinese-american , &quot; or people of color are working , but not in position to feel safe or comfortable to talk &quot; .
other observers shares her opinion - a complaint that snapchat had largely unanswered .
the company publish figures regarding the diversity of its employees , with that has the status of a private company .
on thursday , snapchat declined to talk about the racial origin of their employees , but according to the spokesman , the company has recently adopted a recruitment worker , who should focus on inadequately represented by population , and the internal management of inclusion .
zhuová adds : &quot; i wonder if they really need another such users , who can say that it &amp; apos ; s not right &quot; , with the fact that your account will be canceled .
military officers distorted intelligence about is , says parliamentary committee
the house armed services committee in a report issued on thursday indicated that officers from the central command of the united states changing intelligence reports to depict the more optimistic picture of the war against the islamic state in iraq and in syria , than provide the events from the ground .
according to the preliminary report prepared by the republican chairman of the committee on armed forces , intelligence committee and subcommittee on defense , was found &quot; widespread dissatisfaction &quot; among analysts , the central intelligence services , under which their superiors changed their assessment of the american effort to defeat the islamic state .
the central command , known as centcom , is military central in tampa , florida , which oversees american military operations in the middle east and central asia .
in a press release , the report states : &quot; the intelligence secret services sanctioned centcomu senior officers usually offer a more positive picture of the counter-terrorism efforts of the usa , than have been confirmed by the facts on the ground , and were consistently more positive , than analysis , obtained from other parts of the intelligence community &quot; .
&quot; what happened in centcomu is unacceptable - our warriors are harmed when a superior policy makers presented faulty analysis &quot; , said ken calvert , a republican congressman from california .
failure in leadership centcomu goes all the way to the top of the organisation .
in a ten-page report describes in detail the problems remaining central staff in the description and analysis of america &amp; apos ; s efforts in training iraq &amp; apos ; s forces in 2014 and 2015 .
even if it does not offer any conclusive proof that the obama administration &amp; apos ; s top officials have ordered that the reports were altered , the report notes that the analysts had the impression that they were from centcomu leaders under pressure to present a more optimistic view of the danger posed by the islamic state , or is .
&quot; in the first half of 2015 , there were many press reports the central staff , statements and testimony from congress significantly more positive than what events were in fact &quot; , the report notes .
for example , representative centcomu publicly stated that a major military attack to take mosul could begin in april or may 2015 .
mosul , the second largest city in iraq , remains under the control of the islamic state .
&quot; this is a very clear after months of investigation &quot; , he said in a statement the mp mike pompeo , republican of kansas .
from mid- ? ? ? ? to 2014 , manipulated the intelligence staff of the central headquarters of the us with intelligence services hq in order to downplay the danger of is in iraq .
the republicans set up a working group after he learned about the concerns of analysts , that the information the intelligence services relating to islamic state are manipulated .
the report , published on thursday , must be after another investigation followed by a more detailed examination .
in centcomu intelligence service is yet another investigation by the inspector general of the department of defense .
democratic members of the intelligence committee published on thursday its own findings which correspond to some of the conclusions of the working group of republicans .
&quot; between 2014 and 2015 , the centcom has produced a very narrow the process for drawing up evaluation of information on is and iraq &amp; apos ; s security forces said in a statement &quot; , the representative adam b. schiff , the president of the committee and representatives of the democrats .
in the words of adam schiff this process &quot; led to the distortion of the intelligence services &quot; , damaged morale among analysts and &quot; inadequately reflect the dissenting views &quot; .
however , schiff and democrats claim that they found no evidence that the white house tried to push centcomu analysts to adjust their findings to &quot; the draft or the political situation &quot; .
the preliminary results of the investigation were published on tuesday in the daily beast .
last year in august , the new york times reported the pentagon inspector general &amp; apos ; s investigation , which was launched after complaints from analysts centcomu .
lieutenant commander patrick evans , spokesman for the pentagon , in a statement , said that the ministry of defence will not comment on parliamentary report , because the inspector general &amp; apos ; s investigation still continues .
it stated , however , that &quot; experts are sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data , and the intelligence community and department of defense welcome healthy dialogue on these vital questions of national security &quot; .
the investigation has implications beyond the question of whether the us-led bombing campaign in iraq and syria successfully ( operative part , which now claims a growing number of leaders of defense ) .
however , last year &amp; apos ; s indictment has raised question marks about the extent to which president obama can count on a central staff honestly evaluating military operations in iraq , afghanistan , libya and other crisis areas .
the criticism intelligence about the islamic state reflects conflicts for more than ten years , when centcomu intelligence analyst gregory hooker wrote a research paper in which it was claimed that the administration of president george w. bush - despite the opposition of many analysts - advocated a small force in iraq and spent little time thinking about what would follow the invasion in 2003 .
hooker also played a key role in the opposition against the intelligence services of the islamic state .
last year , the authorities announced that hooker team concluded that , despite public statements to the contrary , the air strikes against islamic state refineries not significantly dilute the resources of this terrorist group because the group has built temporary refinery and oil is sold on the black market .
the times in september was informed of the findings but was not transmitted outside the central headquarters .
centcomu commander , gen. lloyd j. austin iii , was then subjected to criticism last year after many lawmakers found evidence the senate too positive assessment of the war .
general austin in april resigned and in centcomu replaced gen. joseph l. votel .
the us prevailed in field hockey in the fourth game in a row , so today will play a decisive game in team great britain
katie bamová in the match against japan , which ended 6 : 1 , scored three goals , and just a day after the american women &amp; apos ; s field hockey team scored the first two goals of the match , on thursday , america defeated india 3 : 0 .
five goals in two games is the success of a good memory , but bamová ( 27 ) said she &amp; apos ; s not sure whether she &amp; apos ; s ever done .
&quot; i have no idea &quot; , she said .
i &amp; apos ; m not one of those who take their wickets are entered .
this but knows : american at the olympic tournament lead to games 4 : 0 and is the first place in the group with great britain , which remained on thursday , after the defeat of japan 2 : 0 stay undefeated .
great britain and the united states will meet on saturday in the final game of the first round .
both teams qualified for the quarter finals and the game will decide who of the group of six teams over the first and who &amp; apos ; s in second place .
the team from the first place for a while longer to avoid strong danes , who are at the forefront of the other group .
whatever saturday &amp; apos ; s game is over , americans here its surprising driving caused a stir , four years after they ended up among the 12 teams at the olympics in london .
in that team was even bamová .
she grew up in blue bell , pennsylvania , and field hockey stick her hand for the first time when she was 3 years old ( her older twin sisters played in drexel ) and into the national team came when she was 16 and became the youngest player ever .
the olympics in 2008 she escaped because he didn &amp; apos ; t make the final roster .
then came 2012 , when power failed her , not even the ladies of her team .
the next year he was appointed coach englishman craig parnham and things began to change .
&quot; cultural change , mental change , physical alteration &quot; , said bamová .
in london , we didn &amp; apos ; t have such a pace of work , as we have today .
we did a complete turnaround .
thursday night bamová launched vstřelením bekendem goal in the first half from close range .
india came into the match without a victory in the tournament , but the team has proven surprisingly hard and keep the score 1 : 0 until the end of the third quarter , when bamová opportunity .
she escaped on the left side of the playing field , then scurried to the center and shot the ball into the goal , to get american women into the lead 2 : 0 .
melissa gonzalez added the final goal in the middle of the fourth quarter .
the decommissioning brankářky american women , jackie briggs , who helped win in each of the three to one goal , was the first ever in the tournament .
he &amp; apos ; s in great shape .
just like bamová .
&quot; now we &amp; apos ; re in a good place &quot; , said parnham , but how good it is , it will depend on the outcome of saturday &amp; apos ; s game .
zen trampoline in the middle of the olympic frenzy
it doesn &amp; apos ; t matter where you are , it doesn &amp; apos ; t matter what time it is - it &amp; apos ; s the olympics .
the events in rio de janeiro is to feel persistent , unspeakable and biased rotation competition and effort .
it is , as the olympic torch itself was hot štafetovým stake , which is passed from lustřelce swimmers , gymnasts and triatlonistovi .
you can &amp; apos ; t turn on the tv , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor &amp; apos ; s conversation in the queue in the coffee shop , you heard of simon bilesové , katie ledecky or hostility between michael phelps and chad le closem .
and then is also logan dooley .
dooley , the darling of women with dimples , it is in the olympics for the first time and could also be among those whose names sound in homes in prime time between advertising and sponsor spots , if he &amp; apos ; d been a swimmer , gymnast or even the swordsman .
but dooley ( 28 ) from lake forest , california , is fighting for olympic gold in jumps on the trampoline .
the olympic fire off all the competition as well .
away from the centre , a bit in the shadows are the sports that are not generally recognised : the shooting of air guns , archery , badminton , taekvondo .
always we will have success in the classic swimming style - and will probably rule for long .
but if i may appoint a special favourite , allow me to draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
even if they are jumping on the trampoline an olympic sport since 2000 , when they were first placed on the olympics in sydney , remains after 16 years of interventions the sport almost unnoticed - many people , which i asked , didn &amp; apos ; t even know that it &amp; apos ; s an olympic sport .
it may be a regional indifference .
us never medal in not jumping on the trampoline , and up to 2012 , none of the athletes didn &amp; apos ; t even get to the finals .
prices in the male category are usually divided between china and russia and in the female category between china and canada .
this year will be the gold medal from london i &amp; apos ; m involved dong dong of china and rosie maclennanová from canada .
ski jumping on trampolines are but another smůluo , partly because it will be more of the uninitiated ear that seem more suited to clown college , before the olympics .
i have to admit , i &amp; apos ; m not an expert , but the only enthusiast watching from the ground .
it has comic potential - comic vibe of endless fighting off - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving , two sports , which combines .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; is derived from the spanish &quot; el trampolines &quot; , which means &quot; diving board &quot; .
aspiring champions are jumping on a giant trampoline , which is shooting up to nearly 10 feet and show the report with several elements ( flips , screws and combinations of ) , before finally landing on his feet again .
according to the official olympic program are judged by performance , difficulty and &quot; time in the air &quot; .
in rio , will compete against ? ? athletes from 17 countries , the 16 men and 16 women .
the usual trajectory of the olympic track is forward .
the warriors of the gold medals has to go further , faster and higher , sometimes to the death , sometimes back and forth , up and down .
he &amp; apos ; s trying to catch up with not only the tape or starting the wall , but as mentioned in the news media , also another imaginary line : world or olympic record .
this unanimous effort is noble , admirable , a little fanatical - and sufficient to brought viewers to tears .
but to me , it &amp; apos ; s also somewhat exhausting when you &amp; apos ; re watching the olympics .
ski jumping on a trampoline in this regard provide relief .
the track athlete on the trampoline is upwards .
the rationale is not moving forward .
he or she is reflected , as if they were weightless as astronauts , flying up , then down , then up and down with no effort .
without competition , and , of course , or the difficulty of it , but for the duration of the assembly of ferocious fighting , no target , no measuring distances , but just perfect , graceful suspension , time and gravity .
this is the closest to where the olympics and zen approach .
qualification and women &amp; apos ; s finals will be held on friday afternoon , at 13 : ? ? eastern time , the men &amp; apos ; s competition on saturday , then at the same time .
the station nbc final will be broadcast in the afternoon block , which begins after two days in 14 hours .
in the middle of the olympic madness promise a calm , pleasant moments that , despite other fights probably miss .
and if my attention only so that the male athletes will be the subject of ogling and manifestation - as according to the wall street journal recently suggested the us gymnasts - then logan dooley only waiting for his new fans who are gasping for air .
&quot; protesters generation &quot; in ethiopia , many allies of the us
violent protests in ethiopia
demonstrators demanding political change in ethiopia encountered violent resistance from the government .
witnesses say that during the clashes with police were shot , many of the protesters .
there is war in ethiopia ?
in the past decade , it was one of the most stable nations in africa , the western alliance with the rapidly growing economy .
in the last few months but the country erupted in anti-government riots that spread to more areas .
just last week , thousands of people took to the streets , who demand the fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations , the government response was ruthless .
witnesses claim that police officers shot and killed the crowds of unarmed protestors .
in the videos of the protests , which are believed to be from late last year or early this year , they were members of the security forces , as hitting young people with sticks , after they were forced to stand against the wall on his hands .
the united nations high commissioner for human rights now calls for a thorough investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult to keep this country together and to move forward , it will be even harder &quot; , said rashid abdi , project leader horn of africa for the international crisis group research group .
ethiopia is after nigeria &amp; apos ; s second most populous nation in africa , and its stability is supported by the west .
american military and intelligence services work closely with ethiopians on eliminating the risk of a terrorist attack in the area , particularly in somalia , and very few of the african countries , if any , receives such help from the west .
the economy of ethiopia , it has developed an impressive pace .
its infrastructure has improved significantly - in the capital city of addis ababa drive even a new commuter train .
and the streets are typically quiet , safe and clean .
of course , ethiopia can be hard as a role model for democracy - the organisations fighting for human rights talks incessantly about government repression - the opposition was suppressed in the country , dissidents effectively silenced .
many of them were expelled , imprisoned , killed or driven away into the desert .
but that may be changing .
&quot; when people enough and they have no choice but to protest , there is a break &quot; , said seyoum teshome , who lectures at the university of central ethiopia .
under protest , all the young people .
under protest in a generation .
a complaint is many and relate to everything from disputes about land after the absolute control of power for the ruling coalition .
after last year &amp; apos ; s elections , which were widely criticised , the ruling party and its allies the last chair held by the opposition in parliament , and now controls 100 percent .
it also increases the pressure on the eritrean border . the conflict along the disputed border , this inaccurately marked in june has claimed hundreds of lives .
anylitici worry that the separatist group in recent years , which have been more or less suppressed , as is ogadenská oromská liberation front or national liberation front , may try to take advantage of the confusion and rearm .
there are several factors that explain why now after years of smoldering under the surface , these bitter feelings again .
the first of these is the seemingly harmless : smart phones .
many ethiopians can communicate via social networks until the last few years , they became commonly available cheaper smart phones and to improve the provision of online services .
and even if the government ban on access to facebook or twitter , as it &amp; apos ; s normally going on particularly during the protests , many people can still communicate via the internet proxy , which hide the location of these people .
several young ethiopians spoke about how they were gathering to protest .
in addition , there is a greater solidarity between the oromos and amhary , the two largest ethnic groups in ethiopia .
oromové and amharové are not natural allies .
after a long ages amharové , mainly from the christian ethiopia , excelled in politics and trade and use of oromos , many of which are muslims and live in lowland areas .
but that is also changing .
&quot; we &amp; apos ; re on the way to a united leadership &quot; , said oromů mulatu gemechu , leader .
the largest protests took place in areas populated by amhary and oromos .
many amharů oromů and wrongly believes that ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic tigrajů , which make up around 6 percent of the population and controls the military , intelligence services , trade and politics .
a third reason for the unrest is the death of meles zenawi .
zenawi , the former rebel leader , was prime minister for 17 years until his death in 2012 , when not succumbed to the disease .
he was considered a tactical genius , a man who was able to see around the corner .
analysts say that particularly masterful ability to detect early signs of discontent and used ambassadors to opponents of the process and get on his side .
&quot; the current regime lacks the basic knowledge &quot; , said abdi , an analyst of the conflict .
the new prime minister , hailemariam desalegn , ethiopia was dragged out of relative obscurity to replace zenawiho .
unlike zenawiho , who was from the area &amp; apos ; s own political provenance of northern ethiopia , hailemariam originates from the south .
analysts argue that it does not have confidence in the security services controlled by tigrejci .
many are concerned that the outcome will be more bloodshed .
the last time ethiopia has experienced such riots in 2005 after that , when thousands of people protesting what analysts call the election , which the government screwed up and then stole .
there was a hard hit , during which there were many protesters were killed - even if less than in recent months - and this period of unrest over relatively quickly .
the experts on the development for ethiopia &amp; apos ; s leaders praised the visionary infrastructure planning , which is a new suburban train and measurable progress in fighting poverty .
of course , it is quite clear that the gradual widening disputes inside the ethiopian government to stop him .
and there is a dangerous ethnic shaping .
last month , protesters in the city of gondar amharském attacked company owned tigrejci and resentment against tigrejcům on social networks are becoming increasingly common .
analysts say that the protests stop embarrassing the us and other western allies .
the us government uses ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring somalia , though , recently stated that the base was closed .
while the west clearly wants to support democracy , while at the same time doesn &amp; apos ; t want to be his ally in the already volatile area apart .
&quot; that &quot; , said abdi , &quot; is a very sharp edge of the blade &quot; .
donald trump explains his statement about obama and funding is as &quot; sarcasm &quot;
donald j. trump on friday tried to downplay the latest controversy , which overflows with his campaign , claims he didn &amp; apos ; t mean it , when several times this week , insisted that the president obama and hillary clinton were the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group islamic state .
the explanation has raised new questions about the ability of the republican candidate for president to speak clearly with the american public .
they &amp; apos ; re in an awkward situation as well as his supporters , who have it hard in the tumultuous time defending and explaining that his comments might mean .
following this proposal at a meeting on wednesday night , trump statement on thursday confirmed and in interviews , he insisted that he did not intend to say that the president and h. clinton is created .
of course the contribution on twitter on friday morning , trump said that he was only being sarcastic .
grant was the opposite of the claim just one day old when trump said in several interviews that his charges , on the other hand , serious .
when the conservative radio host hugh hewitt tried to help trump comment to alleviate reminder that obama seeks to destroy is , the republican candidate for president did not respond .
the latest storm comes at a time when trump tried to focus his campaign on the economy , while his numbers in the polls are falling .
trump and clinton in michigan this week took part in a duel on economic issues .
on friday , trump tried to return to this subject .
on twitter , again warned that clinton &amp; apos ; s proposals are associated with an increase in taxes , and stated that , according to her speech attitudes was boring .
trump used the defence sarcasm before .
at the end of july , when they received a wave of criticism when he stepped out with the proposal that the russians would have to penetrate to the e-mails clinton , your remark later explained : &quot; i am of course being sarcastic &quot; .
this approach allows trump to push the boundaries of political statements and restrain them if necessary .
&quot; i think it &amp; apos ; s his way of testing , the extent to which some reports have resonated with his supporters , to see how they respond , and according to the responses , then one way or another &quot; clarification , &quot; said ruth sherman , a communications specialist , who was watching the language used by both candidates .
also , i think he is clever in its statements , and he knows that they are sufficiently vague to be explained in different ways .
because the results of the polls in his favour to continue to fall , chose trump in recent days even more mocking tone , instead of things to be said for the general electorate .
a new survey from nbc / wall street journal / marist , which was published on friday , showed that tump is a distant for clinton in north carolina , virginia and colorado and very close behind her in florida .
trump is trying to avoid so sorry for provocative statements which , he says , but often accuses his critics of incorrect interpretations of his words or misunderstood his sense of humor .
but along with that , as trump in the final months of the presidential campaign is facing increased attention , claimed trump &amp; apos ; s jokes in an awkward position , his devoted followers followed him , who must publicly state , whether they are his comments any way provocative .
rudolph w. giuliani , the former mayor of the city of new york , which is one of the most prominent trump supporters , must have a candidate on thursday in an interview for cnn at length to defend .
&quot; i believe that what he says is a legitimate political commentary &quot; , said giuliani , when he was asked about the veracity of trump &amp; apos ; s claims that obama and clinton founded isis .
that &amp; apos ; s true , in the sense that before obama was almost unknown is , a small organization that completely erroneously called . and it was because he withdrew their troops from iraq .
most of the current republicans trying to argue that the obama administration , in which clinton served as secretary of state , she allowed that is flourished and couldn &amp; apos ; t handle the situation in the middle east , aggressively .
before pátečními gatherings in pennsylvania trump continue on twitter around the media fire , chewing his every word and are biased against him .
he laughed at &quot; poor , pathetic &quot; television pundits , who tries to understand , and said : &quot; you can &amp; apos ; t ! &quot;
several democrats face at trump &amp; apos ; s apology , it &amp; apos ; s just further proof that he is unfit for the presidency .
the cafe had pushed the market price is now back in greenpoint .
the verb cafe was a shabby place in williamsburg , where you could just pay in cash , without wi-fi , but where the coffee was served for 15 years .
naturally , it occurred that was on the front of the house on bedford avenue expelled .
soap cherie - trade , which is perceived to be replaced in the summer of 2014 - is selling soap in the shape of cupcakes .
locals mourned as the last loss in the sprawling city .
an artist molly crabappleová wrote on twitter : &quot; new york is the change , i know , but i still can &amp; apos ; t believe he &amp; apos ; s dead , the hotel &amp; apos ; s chelsea ransacked and the business is now perceived to be a soap &quot; .
but if new york change , then it is also defending .
vzkříšené verb cafe opened last november in greenpoint , less than a mile north of the original place .
new verb has wifi and accepts payment cards , but they work there some of the original staff and there is similar , unpretentious atmosphere .
also , the coffee is still good .
manager of the new verbu is cisco rodriguez , a longtime employee of the café , which is also the owner and managing director of the new place .
the verb began in 2001 and stayed until the end .
when one of the customers offered to pay for the transfer to a new place , he said he would do it with pleasure .
rodriguez ( 36 ) , leaving a lot of things as they were .

mr. rosenthal to continue ordering what usually , but sometimes your bun with everything lets have bacon , eggs and ham .
rodriguez said he is not sorry , that trade with soaps took his old place .
the truth is that the owners of the soap cherie offered him that , for perceived to make a special soap and as an additive used filter coffee from the cafe .
&quot; i think we still could use &quot; , said rodriguez .
also , the traditional polish residents of greenpoint café well received .
one of the new customers offer translated into polish , and rodriguez said he wants to find a place to expose her soon , to his new neighbors feel at home .
the new place has other advantages .

it offers the possibility to cafe has spread to a neighbouring building .
many customers , it is sufficient that the recovered his old favorite .
joseph whitt was a regular customer and when the cafe closed , said it broke his heart .
mr. whitt says that when the cafe opened , come in and have coffee is like coming home .
&quot; i missed the smell &quot; , he said .
depressing food from the time of the crisis - the &quot; square meal &quot;
shortly after taking office in march 1933 , president franklin delano roosevelt sitting in the oval office and had lunch .
a real president roosevelt enjoyed at selected dishes from 5th avenue as the foie gras pâté and maryland turtle soup .
his menu for that day but was more modest : eggs on the diabolical way in tomato sauce , mashed potatoes , and for dessert , a plum pudding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with people who have suffered &quot; , said jane ziegelmanová .
her husband andrew coe added : &quot; it was also a message to the americans , as they have to eat &quot; .
a couple who lives in brooklyn heights , is devoted to the gastronomic history .
the last book andrew coe &amp; apos ; s &quot; chop suey &quot; was about chinese cuisine in america , while jane in his book &quot; 97 orchard &quot; , tells the life story of an apartment house on the lower east side through food .
their new joint work &quot; a square meal &quot; , published on tuesday by harper , it is the history of american cuisine during the great depression .
we showed solidarity and cooking with a reporter eisenbergově gathered for dinner in a sandwich shop , a small no-frills buffet in the flatiron district , which is in operation from the time of the crisis , since 1929 .
jane ( 54 ) ordered a cream cheese and jelly sandwich with chopped olives , andrew ( 57 ) put the turkey , mashed potatoes and mushy vegetables .
the reporter ordered a burger , which , according to a pair of perfectly matched conversation about food during a crisis .
&quot; meatballs were very popular &quot; , said miss ziegelmanová .
he sold the peanut , liverwurst and bean burger .
they were made from the ingredients and other cheap food , which ingredient set .
imagine the amount of peanuts , which you &amp; apos ; d have to eat for dinner .
andrew coe grinned .
&quot; they would have you in the stomach like lead &quot; , he said .
in the years before the crisis was american cuisine , especially in rural areas , with buffet eat what you eat .
teams of women to cook for the workers from the farm , and for breakfast , lunch and dinner are served fresh baked pie .
they were americans who send food to the starving europeans during the first world war . &quot; and square meal &quot; pursues ways to people about that , all of a sudden , it was not the land of plenty .
&quot; it was a time when the food centre , a worrisome point for the american people &quot; , said coe to explain why he and his wife decided to write about it .
it is feared the new budgetary diet : has the mystery of food , such as burgers and meals from pans , saucepan as &quot; an amazing way to use leftovers &quot; , she said , because the cooks could hide ziegelmanová unaesthetic ingredients under the layer of creamy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit .
meat - for years the central section of the american food - happened economically assigned to luxury .
strange mix , which should serve as a calorie and nutrition panel , should take precedence over taste or even common sense in cooking .
during the research for the book , which contains recipes , ms. ziegelmanová prepared dobové food from an onion stuffed with peanut butter .
&quot; it wasn &amp; apos ; t a popular addition on the dinner table &quot; , said andrew coe .
jane ziegelmanová stressed : &quot; it was surreal &quot; .
peanut butter with roast onions don &amp; apos ; t go together .
it was typical of a lot of home recipes .
now , as never before and never again , domestic economists - among them louise stanley , the resort for the domestic economy in the years 1923 to 1943 - followed the eating habits of the country .
uveřejňovali recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , called for women to take over the reins of the budget , and mash , such as creamy pasta with carrots , turn to taste food .
the book &quot; a square meal &quot; is a celebration of historical tidbits .
first cake arose in response to the government its hungry citizens , like pose president herbert hoover &quot; i &amp; apos ; ll have the pie &quot; .
while publicly praised simple iowa farmhouse kitchen of her childhood , dined like the millionaire he became .
&quot; i like to eat continental cuisine such as fish with cucumber sauce &quot; , said andrew coe .
he ate in almost vyzlacené room , wearing a tuxedo .
he was incredibly old fashioned .
president roosevelt would probably have made the same mistake , if his wife eleanor , prompting him to set an example with his own stomach .
as the book says , mrs. roosevelt hired a housekeeper who wasn &amp; apos ; t interested in the taste at all . as a result , the white house &quot; not only was almost to the food throughout the washington , d.c. , but also by nejneutěšenějším way ready &quot; .
many eating habits from the crisis resolved , as soon as the country is back on its feet .
the link remained in our constant examination of the calories and nutritional values , says ms ziegelmanová , and in the manner in which the science is applied to cooking .
some say that , during the writing of the book to better understand the eating habits of the mother of miss ziegelmanové - must be why couldn &amp; apos ; t throw out food .
&quot; she had a real fear of wasting food &quot; , said andrew coe .
ziegelmanová reminded : &quot; people were sick of it &quot; .
there was an accident with the sugar puffs .
when they were in eisenberg clean tables , she and mr. coe out dessert , which prepare at home : plum dessert that president roosevelt had eaten for lunch .
&quot; it &amp; apos ; s called ziegelmanová plum cream &quot; , she said , and added that the usual trick was to give modest recipes elegant names .
there was no cream , just plums , a bit of flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
each reluctantly plunged a spoon into the thick brown stuff .
surprisingly , it was wrong .
andrew coe added , and then once more .
and like a good treasurer told his wife : &quot; i could use a little strands of walnuts &quot; .

scot callum skinner rushing home after the brits get gold in cycling
callum skinner from scotland stepped into the hall of fame last night in the men &amp; apos ; s team sprint in the velodrome in rio , when a trio of vb team defend the title from london 2012 .
one ? ? -year-old native of glasgow was in the role of the brakes , which took the scot sir chris hoy , and the young man made the legend when it came to target and stole victory from the hands of the favored new zealand .
britain four years ago surprisingly won and hoy won the fifth of his six olympic gold medals .
and the same trick again after modest sixth on the world cycling in the championship in march , although hoy , meanwhile , ended his career .
the problem between beijing and london was to pay for the specialist initial racer jamie staffa .
hindes is thus discovered just in time .
after leaving hoye is also vacant , which tried to fill kian emadi and matt crampton .
skinner was a man of british coaches and search for potential has now been confirmed .
hindes , kenny - who was with hoye champion four years ago - and with skinner achieved the olympic record in qualification , but the leotard took over in the first round of the new zealand .
and the british trio won gold in the team sprint .
hindes was after his round , slightly behind , but kenny team pushed forward and skinner &amp; apos ; s leadership .
the strategy was a big part of the transition , when hindes was riding higher transfer , to slow down and allow kenny and skinner , to keep pace .
hoy race watched from his position and the bbc commentator when skinner , hindes and kenny stepped out on the stage , his eyes off them .
one ? ? -year-old skinner , a native of glasgow , said : &quot; it &amp; apos ; s flattering comparison &quot; .
i &amp; apos ; m here to get the best of me , and to his name .
we have created an olympic record in the finals and we beat the best .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win it .
after the triumph of beside kenny and hoye in london in 2012 , hindes admitted that on purpose after a weak start , fell to the track .
a flag later withdrew and rivals britain had no opportunity to appeal .
this time around this victory to any such problem .
hindes said : &quot; with all the british flags in the stands , i &amp; apos ; ve felt like in london &quot; .
in the last three months , we all as a team together .
we lost in many of the world &amp; apos ; s plants , so again to win the olympics is just amazing .
it &amp; apos ; s one event , one gold medal for the nation , who won seven out of ? ? competitions in beijing and in london .
if this is an indicator of progress over the past five months , then us at the stadium waiting for the successful five days .
with the form that kenny did , it &amp; apos ; s not inconceivable that hoyův repeated success and won three gold medals in one olympics at the same time .
it would then be for kenny - who exactly is on the day , 12 years younger than hoy , also has a birthday on 23 march ( this date seems to be for british sport , sacred in this day &amp; apos ; s birthday also steve redgrave , mo farah and roger bannister ) - meant a total of six gold and one silver medal .
anyway , how many get hoy .
as another kenny will take part in the sprint , which starts today and will last for the next three days .
twenty-eight-year-old native from bolton said : &quot; now i &amp; apos ; m enjoying this .
team race is always the best .
you win , along with the other .
to be honest , winning for himself is a little lonely .
hindes said : &quot; if he wins two more gold medals , he should get a knighthood &quot; .
that was the only medailový race that day , but britain had even more good news .
sir bradley wiggins , ed clancy , steven burke and owain doull have qualified as fastest in your race to four kilometres .
they finished with a time of 3 : 51.943 .
world record , who died in london in 2012 , it &amp; apos ; s 3 : 51.659 .
the first round and the final ( 22 : 42 ) to be held in today &amp; apos ; s second day of the race , which is surely on wiggins .
yesterday , before the qualifying race with commissioner , when umpire called on to measure the height .
in a similar race of women , which continues and ends tomorrow , laura trott , joanna rowsell shandová , elinor barker and katie archibald of milngavie world record with a time of 4 : 13.260 .
team vb relied on his strong team track cycling and dominated the middle period of the olympic games and won a lot of medals .
after a really exceptional performance , demonstrating the utter domination in beijing and in london , during the preparations for the rio expectations lowered .
the background to the dramatic events , not least the resignation of technical director shane sutton in april because of allegations of sexism and discrimination , and the end of the career of greats such as hoy or victoria pendleton .
however , as evidenced by the first night race at the velodrome , it appears that the legendary reputation , that team great britain can bring peak power with perfect timing , could be once again .
the uncertain future of the smelter in portland after termination of a contract for the supply of energy
the future of the portland aluminium smelter in victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is uncertain because of the power plant , which supplies electricity and the company informed of the intention to one of the owners of a smelter in a contract for the supply of electricity to end . it is expected that all the contracts for the supply of electricity will be shortened .
the move comes after the state government of victoria earlier this year decided to extend the provision of subsidies , which are kept in business .
the fixed ? ? -year subsidy expires in november .
in undertaking alcoa portland may be at risk to 2000 jobs .
when closing may be at risk to 2000 jobs - direct or indirect .
and because the smelter consumes about 10 percent of the total electricity produced in victoria , there may be more lavinovitým impacts .
alcoa smelter closed in 2014 point henry , which last year led to the anglesea power station closed .
tavírna alcoa in portland &amp; apos ; s financial ruin and is in danger of closing .
the move comes after years of speculation about the future of the company , initially in response to the strong australian dollar and recently because of prices for the production plant .
agl , which large smelting supplies power from the loy yang a power station in the latrobe valley , said she expects that any of the three other owners also decides to terminate the contract .
its majority owner of the plant is a joint venture between alcoa and alumina , small shares are held by the chinese company citic , and japan &amp; apos ; s marubeni corp .
&quot; agl expects that portland race will continue to work , in other words , therefore , that vyzická electricity demand from the smelter will continue &quot; , she said .
agl has argued that the contracts are so-called &quot; reinsurance contract &amp; apos ; , which should come into force from november 2016 .
contracts have a 12-month notice period , so actually their validity expires in 2017 .
&quot; agl still assumes that the contract will be to participate in profit for the fiscal year 2017 &quot; , said the power plant .
any possible impact on the profits of the agl from fiscal 2018 onwards is currently limited , thanks to strong commodity market outlook for wholesale electricity prices .
agl indicated that the already written down value contracts based on their books amounting to $ 187 million &quot; in the event that the ukončoení occurred &quot; .
alcoa said that the decision to end the contract &quot; has no impact on its ability to operate the mill or to secure the supply of electricity to the chop shop &quot; .
the american company said that in 2010 , it concluded with loy yang account for 20 years , which should apply from november of this year , although it has yet to explain why , from a contract .
analysts are very careful about the possible closure of the portland smelter in victoria and tomago plant near newcastle as a result of the weak economy in the sector .
the operation of the agl stehpen mikkelsen , who at the beginning of this week turned to the analysts , said that portland a year consumes around 600 megawatts of electricity and tomago around 900 megawatts .
if these two had withdrawn from the market , it would mean a substantial reduction in demand on the market &#91; electricity &#93; .
for us as a producer if it wasn &amp; apos ; t good , &quot; he said .
kendall is not only the star of the reality tv show the kardashians - now it &amp; apos ; s cover of september vogue
kendall jenner ( 20 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ) , a model and the fourth daughter matky-manažerky clan kris kardashian-jennerová , appeared on the cover of the september issue of us vogue magazine .
kendall , estee lauder brand ambassador , who was on the fashion weeku in milan , paris and new york , announced the news thursday on its account on instagram .
&quot; in a room full of people , which i love , i &amp; apos ; m looking at this front page wants to cry &quot; , kendall wrote .
the front page was followed by a bizarre ( or simply the continuation and robbers in the administration of the kardashians ? ) staged video , in which the whole family kardashianových-jennerových ( bar punks rob and caitly and with them all the favorite uncle of show business , the producer of keeping up ryan seacrest ) . for the cover her sister &amp; apos ; s forgotten , only to end up a conventional scene : preparing a secret party .
it &amp; apos ; s a tired storyline almost every &quot; birthday &quot; of children &amp; apos ; s tv show ( seacrest says : &quot; did you think we forgot about you ? &amp; apos ; with honesty cartoon rabbit on the show at ? : ? ? in the morning ) , but kris somehow needed to ensure that the other girls on this publicity could capitalize .
because when we look at the september issue of vogue , we have entered a new era of the kardashians .
older sister kim maybe kendall on the cover of vogue ( and was pushed on it together with her husband kanye west in april 2014 ) , but titulka the september issue of the magazine is in another league .
the september issue of vogue magazine &amp; apos ; s best-selling number throughout the year .
the issue with his size , which looks more like a book than a fashion magazine for advertising purposes , attracts a range of advertisers ( fashionista counted , that of the 832 parties in last year &amp; apos ; s edition was 615 pages with advertising content ) .
the star , who appeared on the front page , is eagerly anticipated , so it &amp; apos ; s no wonder that , in the past two years , the magazine images leaked before its official publication .
among the women who appeared on the cover in the past , include naomi campbell , linda evandelista or kate moss .
in recent years , the front page was certainly more &quot; celebrities that make the models &quot; than &quot; models , which are celebrities &quot; .
jennifer lawrence , winner of an oscar and dior brand ambassador , appeared on the cover in 2013 , a year later , had the honour of lagy gaga .
but even if it is very unlikely that kendall - which the magazine describes as &quot; a groundbreaking model &quot; of her generation - falls into the first category , it will be in very good company .
these celebrities are not related to known people , not stars real estate show , or the kids of today , they know how to do well edited video ( even if jenner is all of this ) .
they are demonstrably talented women who excel in the entertainment industry .
beyoncé , which appeared on the front page of the last year , had one of the strongest years in his career thanks to the release of the album lemonade .
of course , not everyone is thrilled with the success of the jenner &amp; apos ; s .
her position in the world of fashion will always be difficult for her to participate in a reality show .
stephanie seymorová , the original victoria &amp; apos ; s secret model in june criticized jenner and her colleague gigi hadidovou and called them &quot; whores of the moment &quot; .
these feelings erupted again with the news that jenner appears on the cover of vogue .
but this discontent is not in place .
kendall jenner is on the cover of the september issue of vogue .
she &amp; apos ; s a supermodel in the true sense of the word .
she &amp; apos ; s showing for marc jacobs .
he sells you make up from estee lauder .
she and all her sisters you are selling photos of themselves on their own paywallech .
she sells photos of cindy crawford &amp; apos ; s daughter , which the photos for the magazine love .
and in your off-time is working on a reality show , maybe only as one of the ways to see kourtney and her children .
komunitní centra legal aid per year , 160 000 people refuse
more than 160,000 of the most vulnerable citizens is every year in community centres and refused legal aid in the sector itself are about the impact that will have further restriction of funds to the already extremely busy services .
in queensland , three out of five people - mostly elderly people , immigrants , workers , victims of violence and people without the financial means to fight unfair eviction and the like - are already in denial , looking for free legal assistance and representation .
the community legal services , which are already strained to the breaking point , they &amp; apos ; re going to further cuts .
from june next year , these centres legal assistance they will lose another 30 percent of the federal government .
the community centres legal aid in queensladu james farrell said that , according to the latest summary report , the national association of community legal centres , it was found that annually is rejected five thousand people .
mr. farrell said that , without the annulment of the decision of the federal government , the situation will only get worse .
&quot; community clubs legal assistance in queensland are chronically underfunded , which means that thousands of people are denied vital services that they need &quot; , he said .
people who escaped from relations with the rapist , people with excessive debts and disabling , families passing through separation , workers who are unfairly dismissed - all these people have problems with legal dimensions and this report shows that they have no chance to get the help they need .
the federal government from june 2017 will reduce funding by 30 percent , which will lead to thousands more vulnerable people from queensland will have to navigate the complex legal problems without help .
we are calling on the prosecutor , and queensland senator george brandise to immediately stop this reduction in finance , for people to get the help they need , when they get into legal problems .
in the past year the government of the state by its commitment to provide funding for legal assistance , up to the national average .
now is the time to look at the needs of the community centers , legal aid and community of their clients and palaszczukova government must invest in this important work .

britain must continue to spread the olympic spirit and expanzovat heathrow
heathrow will also be a source of renewal and prosperity not just for our local community and across london , but across the country .
for me , heathrow is a huge way attractive , just as london was 2012 , when we made exceptional efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions will be able to benefit from the olympic games .
the olympic games were a huge benefit for the east end and stratford .
and we &amp; apos ; ll do it again , so that we create opportunities for local people and businesses in the vicinity of heathrow .
just for our local community výučních creating 10,000 new jobs , 40,000 new jobs and end youth unemployment around the airport .
just like before the london olympics in 2012 , even here there are those who will think that expanding heathrow is too big .
i was told that britain will never be ready for the olympic games and that on the world stage , ridiculous .
doubters were wrong in 2012 and even in the case of heathrow , it turns out that they were wrong .
he will always be the envelope , but heathrow will be able to answer every question , which concerns it .
just like the olympic games , is heathrow infrastructure project , which involved many people and companies , not just a few .
the extension is an opportunity to create 180 000 new jobs , economic growth of £ 211 billion , leaving a legacy of skills and employment both in the vicinity of the airport , in the whole of great britain .
we have a great team at heathrow , which in term and have a set budget introduced a programme of infrastructure investment for £ 11 billion , from terminal t5 - who was selected as the best terminal in the world five years in a row , after the terminal t2 , which was built between two ranvejemi roughest in the world .
now they are ready to add a third runway , which is worth £ 16 billion of private investment .
the games in london in 2012 were a huge success for great britain , and i am convinced that expanding heathrow will be too .
it &amp; apos ; s time for us to spread the spirit of the olympic games and expand heathrow , to secure business for the future and leave the heritage of skills and employment , to which britain can be proud of .

adblock plus - facebook in the game of cat and mouse in blocking ads
from attempts to circumvent ad blocking programs , to online marketing companies , which earn , has become a game of cat and mouse . at least it maintains one of the companies , that such software programmed .
on thursday , just two days after facebook announced that he will block advertising filters on its desktop website , adblock plus has published on its website , which states that , in the users can update the filters in their programme and again to block advertising on the social network .
facebook on tuesday claimed that its desktop website coding changes around the commercials , filters for advertising to be more complicated to figure out which parts of the website are advertising .
adblock but now argues that the new codes already .
the speaker adblocku ben williams into the blog , he wrote that &quot; this kind of war between the open source community blocking ads , and those who are trying to circumvent , ever since it was invented by blocking ads &quot; , and that facebook is likely to come with its own correction .
the fact that the company owning the largest social network in the world to war involved , just goes to show how big the problem with blocking ads for industry .
according to the study , carried out last year , adobe and pagefair bedside is used all over the world filters advertising around 200 million people - almost four times higher than it was in 2013 .
mobile advertising is now at 84 percent of the profits from advertising on facebook , every day facebook from mobile devices will visit 1.03 billion active users .
the spokesman said that the company is of course against advertising filters smtp , because mobile advertising on the mobile app filters for the social network and instagram don &amp; apos ; t work .
advertisements for smtp still represent profits so high , that facebook has decided to invest in it .
facebook also said on tuesday that it will update the instrument for the &amp; apos ; set &amp; apos ; advertising &amp; apos ; ( ad preferences ) , in order to give people the opportunity to better control how their ads are displayed .
on thursday , facebook said that the new filters adblocku is concerned , because the site may also block content that has nothing to do with advertising .
&quot; for people it &amp; apos ; s not a pleasant experience and we want to solve this problem &quot; , the facebook spokesperson said in an email statement .
blocking ads is a blunt tool , and that is why we prefer to focus on building tools , such as ad preferences , which can control the people .

it was possible to impact to prevent ?
this applicant must find out , &quot; said hofstetter .

just go win , laughing murray with bond .
the rowers eric murray and hamish bond from new zealand dominate category ? s without a helmsman in seven years and her dominance was also confirmed at the olympic games in rio de janeiro .
at first glance an odd pair switched to a smaller crew after the olympics in beijing and , since 2009 , crushing the competition .
the rodrigo de freitas lagoon in thursday &amp; apos ; s final in 69th win in a row .
what we &amp; apos ; re different than the others ?
we &amp; apos ; re just nicer , murray joked during the olympic regatta , when he had to answer questions about the dominance of the new zealand pair .
frankly , we &amp; apos ; re not doing anything different than the other .
just practice hard , very hard .
and all the time we are trying to improve his technique , that &amp; apos ; s our philosophy , murray said already more seriously .
their dominance is also remarkable because they are physically different .
murray is almost ? -foot- ? and ? ? ? -pound guy , academically looking bond is about five inches shorter and 15 pounds lighter .
in addition , they have a different nature .
bond is studying a věnuje se finance , murray has for example a charity boxing match .
even outside of rowing together for that much .
eric getting into boats , in essence , with that we can &amp; apos ; t lose .
just let &amp; apos ; s go win .
i tend to think about what can go wrong , said bond , who was also at the press conference demonstrated that dominant in the crew &amp; apos ; s murray .
he always answered first , and bond waiting for his opportunity .
but on water , destroying opponents quiet power .
they &amp; apos ; re your pace and , though often still in the middle of the track are not in the lead , to their gradual acceleration even opponents found the recipe .
race you to the dvoukilometrové track and we never wanted to take the first kilometre high .
i &amp; apos ; m just trying to go the pace that nobody else can .
we know what we have to do to win , &amp; quot ; said ? ? -year-old murray .
with his four years younger partner won seven gold medals at the world cup .
triumfovali even in 2007 , when they were both members of the gold four without a helmsman .
right after the unexpected failure of a larger crew at the olympics in beijing a year later , they decided to move to second without a helmsman .
at the olympics in london , probably the biggest defeat of his career to make up for and dominance confirmed even in rio .
london was very intense .
we did everything the coach said , and no questions asked .
this time it was a little more fun .
we knew it would be bloody difficult , and we had to make sure that we &amp; apos ; re mentally well , said murray .
we know that all of us want to overthrow the throne .
the target on his back all the time .
we are but we try to be half a step ahead of everyone , he added .
the model the climate according to nasa : venus was once habitable
according to a new nasa climate model projections , venus was once habitable .
scientists in goddardově institute for space studies , nasa developed a model for exploring venus using tools and algorithms , similar to those used by scientists studying climate change .
the model was designed to determine whether used on venus , whose surface is hot , no water and replete with co2 , could dominate in conditions similar to earth .
scientists have previously suggested that the low rate of venus can be explained by its thick atmosphere .
according to the most recent simulations , but , it seems that venus once could boast of thin atmospheres similar to earth and turning around slowly .
the model also dealt with an earlier topography of venus .
the planet likely areas drier than on earth , but once it was enough water and geographical diversity to rule her life and provide protection against rapid evaporation .
venus had also benefited from the sun , which was about 30 percent dimmer .
&quot; in a simulation model giss venus during the slow rotation exposes his daily hand to the sun for nearly two months at a time &quot; , said a scientist from giss anthony del genio in a new report .
the heating of the surface and in the formation of rain , which creates a thick layer of cloud , that behave like an umbrella , and the surface of the steel from excessive solar heat .
the result is climate , with average temperatures , which are in fact slightly lower than currently on earth .
the model put together the story of venus a similar evolution , which previously built a hypothetical planetary scientists .
even though she was venus in the past probably habitable -- during the several billion years -- was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet radiation .
its oceans evaporated water vapour and ultraviolet light were burned .
the hydrogen escaped and left only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide , the greenhouse gas effect of death -- it &amp; apos ; s venus , as we know it today .
the researchers of the new climate model results to venus , published in the journal geophysical research letters .
patrick roy resigned as coach the team the colorado avalanche
patrick roy on thursday , resigned from his post the coach and vice president of hockey operations team colorado avalanche , stated as a reason for the inability to participate in the decision-making process in matters of team .

the workers on an oil rig in the north sea renewing talks and interrupt the strike
the top leaders of parties claimed that the strike over wages to workers to oil platforms in the north sea are interrupted , while all the parties together for a new round of negotiations .
the strikes against the oil field services company wood group were sporadically on platforms in the north sea , which is operated by royal dutch shell .
&quot; wood group and the trade union unite and the rmt can confirm that agree to the renewal process for addressing current disagreements &quot; , according to the statement .
starting next week we will have over the next few weeks a series of all-day meeting , where the problems we see from new angles .
according to the trade unions is their recent actions , which , they say , was the first in more than 25 years , in protest against wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
the company wood group this year has reduced rates and pay their suppliers in the north sea by about 9 percent less because of negative market pressures .
the reduction rates companies comes after a ? ? % reduction for the offshore company in 2014 .
the company claims that further cuts would provide space to cope with a market downturn .
on the other hand , shell cut out of their salary slips for thousands of people and announced plans to abandon operations in the field of oil and gas in 10 countries to modernize their processes - immediately after the mega merger with british energy company bg group .
energy companies are under pressure because of low oil prices , the economic situation relating to the june decision by britain to leave the european union .
a member of parliament from scotland dave anderson at the start of this week to meet with union leaders to discuss one of the greatest working differences across generations , which led to a strike in the north sea .
north sea , as stated , it is for the economy in the region is vital .
&quot; in the north sea and across the country we need an economy that works for all , not just for some &quot; , said in a statement .
for comparison , in 2016 is expected to be nearly $ 1.4 billion investment in new projects in the north sea , while the average for the last five years was around $ 7 billion .
kepler measures the speed of rotation of stars in the pleiades
the latest mission , nasa &amp; apos ; s kepler space telescope to help astronomers gain almost complete list at the speed of rotation of the stars of the pleiades star cluster .
the new data will help astronomers understand why star in the star cluster spinning at different speeds , and also , as the period of rotation is related to the creation of the planet .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other clusters we learn more about the relationship between a stellar mass , its old age and even the history of the solar system &quot; , said in a new report , luisa rebullová , researcher in the centre of caltech &amp; apos ; s infrared processing and analysis center in pasadena .
the cluster pleiades is located 445 light-years from earth .
many of the stars in the cluster of adult status is right now , and probably over 125 million years ago .
now turns as quickly as possible .
in moments of maximum speed of rotation of these teenage stars emit huge quantities of stellar wind .
as these winds moving along the magnetic fields of stars , they have a slowing effect on them .
along with that , as the star is ageing , slowing its rotation speed .
kepler measures the speed of rotation of every star , so that measures the time between the discovery of recognisable points to the stars -- similar to sunspots .
according to the latest data on the speed of rotation , the greater the stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars .
rebullová compares stars to dancers , more doing pirouettes more slowly than smaller ones .
&quot; in &quot; ballet &quot; pleiades , we see that more massive stars are spinning more slowly , while those moves as quickly as possible , they are usually very light rebullová stars &quot; , she said .
because it &amp; apos ; s so close to the pleiades star cluster , serves as an ideal space laboratory for comparing the quality of the stars and the speed of rotation .
&quot; pleiades provide an anchor for the theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions , in younger and older stars &quot; , said rebullová .
there is still a lot that we want to know about how , when and why the stars are slowing down its rotation speed and so to speak &quot; hang their dancing shoes on the nail &quot; .
rebullová and her colleagues describe in detail the latest analysis of the speed of rotation of the pleiades in three studies , which will soon be published in the astronomical journal .
it &amp; apos ; s the qualifying the agreement required ?
if i didn &amp; apos ; t , then the qualification , forging agreement and after a few months i could go to another hospital ?
it &amp; apos ; s even possible after graduation to work without a login to specialized education ?
this is about that , in the field in which i work , is now a job vacancy in just a little more distant hospital , but in about half a year to release a place in another , where i would then like to work .
so i don &amp; apos ; t know how to address the situation roughly six months , continues .
matches mgr . lenka vlková .
no law does not provide for the obligation to conclude an agreement with the employer of qualification - the hospital .
the agreement is a legal institution regulated by the labour code , and may be entered into between the employee and the employer for the purpose of ensuring a return on the cost of raising or deepening the qualifications of the staff .
in the area of health is under long-term pressure on neuzavírání these agreements with a view to ensuring the mobility of health workers and not all hospitals currently require this agreement .
pursuant to act no 95 / 2004 coll . , on the conditions for the acquisition and recognition of professional competence and specialised fitness for the medical profession of doctor , dentist and pharmacist , expressly , that the participation of the specialisation of education is considered to a deepening skills ( not for the better ) .
this means that qualifying agreement may be concluded under the labour code , only if the costs are at least 75 000 kč .
no law , nor does it lay down an obligation to apply for specialized education .
the law only provides the conditions of a request for inclusion in the field of specialized education .
the doctor , however , is by law entitled to exercise the profession of doctor already thanks to the completion of the required higher education studies , even if the conditions laid down by law ( under the expert supervision of a doctor with specialist qualifications in the relevant field ) .
the law provides for a situation where the specialized education can be the doctor counted professional experience acquired in another field of specialisation , where its content and scope of the corresponding to the respective training programme .
in theory it would be possible to count time spent elsewhere , which would correspond to the tazatelčině situation .
however , in the light of that i don &amp; apos ; t know the specific circumstances of this case , it is advisable to consult the relevant department of the ministry of health ( department of science and the medical profession ) , as the department of health from the law provides advisory and consulting services relating to inclusion in the specialized education and with his progress .
crisis consulting service also offers free of charge by a member of the czech medical chamber , which every doctor must be .
doctors from the syrian aleppo they ask for the intervention of the us .
the united states , no effort in order to end the siege of ( rebel parts of the city by government forces ) , and did not use its influence to promote the protection of civilians , quoted from the letter addressed to the white house agency afp .
&amp; quot ; we don &amp; apos ; t need tears , compassion , and even prayers ; desperate , however , we need to create a no-fly zone over eastern halabem , to halt the attacks , and we need international action , which would ensure that the halab again surrounded , &amp; quot ; said the doctor .
russian forces , which support the army loyal to president bashar al-assad have announced that from today , stop for three hours every day strikes in the area of aleppo , to allow the safe passage of humanitarian convoys .
from 9 : 00 to 12 : 00 selČ be suspended all military activities , air strikes and artillery fire .
the chief stephen o &amp; apos ; brien , the un humanitarian operations may be welcomed , stressed , however , that there is a need for at least a two-day truce .
for obama , according to afp in the letter has 15 of the 35 doctors who operate in the eastern part of aleppo , already controlled by the rebels .
it says that , during the five-year war witnessed a violent , cruel death of countless patients , friends and colleagues .
the world takes into account , and notes how syria is complex , but does little to protect us .
recent offers the evacuation of citizens from the syrian regime and russia sounds like a slightly veiled threats , pointed out the pediatricians , surgeons and other physicians .
the doctors said that for the past month , there were 42 attacks on medical facilities in syria , 15 of the hospitals in which they work .
most of it we are sad that we have to decide who lives and who dies .
the emergency room come to us little children with such severe injuries that we have to choose between them , they are the most likely to survive .
and sometimes we don &amp; apos ; t have the necessary material to help them , described the doctor .
two weeks ago suffocated four newborns when the blast interrupted oxygen supply to their incubators .
they gasped for breath , and then their life is over - before he could really begin , recalled .
the army loyal to president bashar al-assad , supported by russian forces , in recent weeks has surrounded the rebels controlled the eastern part of aleppo , inside were left without food supplies over 200,000 people .
rebels who are under the constant strikes of the russian and syrian air force , on saturday after three weeks , managed to break the siege and to launch a counteroffensive .
both parties then have been added in the city and its surroundings .
