it let itself lead with its family across the plant of the alrv , on a horse vogue it itself not times to photo purposes .
the first time was longer in aachen and concomitantly with the chio .
the reason was quite convincing .
german sports aid presented in the context of a small gala the golden sport pyramid to the man from anhausen .
awards it does not lack the pleasant sportsman .
order of merit , silver laurel leaf , champion tour player of the year …
even the british queen already ennobled it .

clintons and trumps economic policy in the comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
in infrastructure and the trade agreement invests ttp prevents - both clinton and trump want that .
in disagreement itself the two us president shank applicants are however with the tax and energy policy as well as in a matter of principle .
the differences in the economic policy between donald trump and hillary clinton a fundamental , rather philosophical difference is the basis .
that , over the role of the state .
trump wants to keep rather small in the doubt and warns before it , like the state of the economy to harm can - with taxes and adjustments .
clinton wants to tax and to death adjust the economy to death , says it .
it against it would completely different be , maintains trump .
it will go back adjustments substantial , and he makes himself strong for an extensive tax revision with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for enterprises .
clinton against it says : the state has to fulfill certain tasks , it has disadvantaged opportunities to open and needs for it money .
therefore the taxes for the realms were increased , say them .
interestingly enough itself both very close with the topic infrastructure is .
into those , nearly says trump and clinton must be invested .
the democratic applicant announces the largest investment into new jobs since the second world war .
national investment programs into the infrastructure are classical democratic policy and for instance by the state-critical teaparty wing of the republicans are strictly rejected .
to trump thus still internal party discussions could come .
the differences are clearer in the energy and climate policy .
trump wants to build coal-fired power stations and the coal promotion in the usa again for raising .
oil production should be possible also in areas protected so far , which paris climate protection agreements wants it to quit .
clinton against it wants to develop the renewable energies with its investment program expressly and demands : “ a country will become the superpower of the clean energies and millions jobs will create . ”
“ it becomes probably either china , germany or america its - i want that we are it . ”
but not only with the infrastructure - also with international trade agreements the two competitors are not too far from each other distant .
tpp , the transpazifische trade agreement , want not to sign both .
at the same time both want to isolate however the usa not from the international trade - to separate simply only american jobs better to protect .
those are to be also better paid then , demand for instance clinton .
the present minimum wage of 7,25 us dollar is a pittance .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollar per hour .
which wants to do trump in this question , is not completely clear : once he says : the minimum wage must up , then it , he says may not be changed .
but the large discussion of the coming months might develop probably rather around the tax policy of the both bearings .
on the one side stands trump , which wants to relieve the economy and the citizens , in order to set growth in motion .
its critics reproach to it , thus became the budgetary deficit only more largely .
on the other side stands clinton , which wants to require at least of the realms that they pay more taxes , and their critic to say : more taxes are also not the solution .
escape : “ each fled woman has experiences by sexual force ”
sexual force belongs for women , who flee alone , nearly already to the everyday life .
if they arrive at germany , they are often traumatized .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen four women sit .
everyone has a baby , who is old at the most one year .
one put its small son into the arm .
it looks with large eyes curiously into the area .
its mother stares at the desk top .
until it notices that she is observed .
it smiles briefly and kisses the small one .
the scene works normally .
until one speaks with katrin bahr .
she is a range range from condrobs , a carrier for social offers of help in bavaria , and concerns herself among other things with the topic women on the escape .
the four women in the kitchen are fleeing .
they live in munich the north in one of the few decentralized accommodation for alone-fled women and their children in bavaria .
in january condrobs opened the facility as well as pro familia and that munich for women &apos;s aid organisation .
recently it was officially opened .
there 60 people live - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are men none - also not as a visitor .
the exception is a guard before the door .
“ it is not to be said exaggerated : each woman , who arrives here , made , says experiences by sexual force on her escape ” bahr .
“ men flee because of wars , because they are politically pursued , because torture or death threatens them or because they send , tell their families as hopes to europe ” them .
with women other reasons for the escape outweigh : “ many steal themselves secretly of it because they do not see other way out ” .
in their homeland they made for experience with sexual force , forced marriages , honour killings , slavery or forced prostitution .
that chases away it .
on the escape that continues .
“ that tractors demand for example for a bottle of water a sexual action , are no rarity ” , say bahr .
and the women are alone , them not by their families are protected .
who believes that end , as soon as they would arrive at germany , err , tell bahr .
single women in refugee accommodation were often regarded also here as inferior and abused at worst .
that leads to it that about 90 percent of the women , who live in the accommodation in munich the north it is traumatized , estimates it .
“ did not develop surely some the children voluntarily ” .
many women are so used to it that they do not say anything .
“ or they dare not to speak openly about the experienced because the shame is too large ” .
since they would often not know to help itself , need it more accommodation only for them , demand bahr .
in bavaria the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
to the question , whether they would know from a similar project as in munich in their scope of responsibility , it answers some with no .
in upper palatinate and upper franconia about there is not something like that in accommodation of the governments .
also in swabians alone fled women are accommodated separately , say karl-heinz meyer , pressesprecher of the government .
in upper bavaria , under and middle franconia there are floors or own houses in some community accommodation only for single women and their children .
the exception is lower bavaria , there gives it to two central of accommodation exclusive for women .
also the committee of “ rights of the woman and equality of the sexes ” in the european parliament demands that women must be accommodated separately from men .
in a study , which was published for the committee , it means : “ it is very important that men and women are separately accommodated . ”
“ the privacy is missing or men and women is together accommodated , can it continually - force against women come ” .
above all the wash rooms should be easily accessible separately and for women , stand in the study .
the how very women feel this protection need , one can read off from the crush , which there is on the house in munich .
“ since itself got around that there are us , have we a long waiting list ” , says bahr .
one could open easily a second house .
assistant physicians strike : demands for new forms of industrial action
deputies of the assistant physicians called their trade union to approve new forms of industrial action with their disputes concerning a new contract .
the junior doctors &apos;s committee ( jdc ) that british medical association ( bma ) demanded its entire advice to approve starting from at the beginning of september more forms of industrial action .
the jdc stated that it ministers would have neglected to deal with the concerns concerning the contract .
assistant physicians and medical students co-ordinated in july on the refusal of a contract , which was agreed upon with the bma .
it was rejected of 58 % of its members , that co-ordinated with the elections .
in a letter to the members , which was published on thursday evening on twitter , the chairman of the jdc ellen mccourt said that the government would have remained “ persistently calm ” to problems , which led to the fact that the contract was rejected .
she said : “ considering its jdc executive committee co-ordinated to reject the suggested new contract completely and to all your concerns requested official renegotiations . ”
when the jdc executive committee has today a formal request for a special meeting of the bma of advice placed answer to the silence of the government , in order a current program of escalating forms of industrial action , at the beginning of septembers begins to approve .
the disputes led to it that assistant physicians struck this year six times , the first blackouts in the history of nhs .
the director / conductor of the bma of assistant physicians dr. johann malawana withdrew after the choice for the refusal of the agreed upon contractual conditions , which had been recommended of the bma .
it communicated bma to members during the meetings , which took place still before the vote by 54.000 assistant physicians and medical students , that the contract was favorable and should be accepted .
after the vote the minister of health jeremy hunt said that the contract for physicians would obligatorily be introduced to england .
russia and turkey : a “ alliance of outsiders ” ?
it was a gesture , which terminated a crisis .
the leaders russlands and turkey met on tuesday , in order to give themselves the hands and to announce an official end of the eight months long persisting war of the words and economic sanctions .
but when vladimir putin takes his turkish opponent in the gilded hall of the st. petersburger of palace in receipt , i cannot refuse myself the impression that ankara wants this reconciliation at most .
there was the handshake , yes .
but of putin smile worked schmallippig and he radiated hardly warmth , even for his reserved conditions .
recep tayyip erdogan however spoke repetitive of its “ dear friend ” putin - according to a report whole five time .
i could not count it any longer .
he promised also the fact that the relations with russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis will even still improve but .
on the next day a newspaper that erdogan would have behaved in such a way , described as if something bad would have never happened .
its enthusiasm seemed to suggest rather the opposite to me .
but , a lasting coolness radiating from putin showed that head of state russlands had not forgotten the anything .
rather the cause of the crisis was first , which it mentioned in its introduction words : the firing of a russian combat aircraft at the syrian border by turkey .
moscow reaction at the time was inflamed with rage .
putin distributed and accused ankara of , russia in the backs pleases to be .
offence was even still larger , since it was committed by an alleged friend .
the vetrauen will again construct with difficulty , if become not even impossible .
the public opinion in russia changed itself for november .
months long implemented the state-controlled mediums a violent , unrestricted attack on ankara .
at once it seemed , as if the turks for everything would carry the debt .
the accusations were most serious from leading officials that erdogans own family would have profited from the illegal oil trade in areas of syria , which are controlled by the so-called islamic state .
it denied this vehemently .
but in st. petersburg the official message that it was time read , to look forward .
finally this meeting took place only , because putin received the apology , which it wanted to hear from president erdogan .
russia could book a kind victory .
for ankara the advantages of an armistice are clearly obvious .
erdogan needs primarily all friends , whom he can get , after he was relieved last month with a failed coup d &apos;etat nearly of his office .
repetitive terrorist raids on turkey likewise shook it .
but there are also economic motives .
russian sanctions met turkey hard - in particular the prohibition of charter flights , which bring each year usually several millions russian tourists to the turkish coast .
the number decreased around nearly 90 % .
in russia tour operators and charter companies will be relieved , if the flights are again taken up .
they count on a lateseasonal attack to the mediterranean .
this week prognosticated public television cheaper fruit and vegetable , as soon as the turkish agrarian imported goods are again permitted .
a report in vedemosti formulated it as follows : “ tourists there long , tomatoes here long . ”
but the visit had an additional political value for moscow .
ankara is furious on the west , since it regards its reaction to the tried seizure of power as weak answer .
in addition continuous resentment over the snail speed of the eu accession negotiations and the putin come - which are eager to pull from the cool tendency benefit and to reduce the relationship of turkey with the west .
the russian head of state won a bonus in ankara with security for the fact that he demanded support for the selected state organs after the tried coup d &apos;etat .
that is for moscow mind you a matter of course , which has even a low-sitting fear of regime changes .
the summit in this glossful palace at the sea made it possible for russia and turkey to represent one , as it described me an analyst once , to “ alliance of outsiders ” : two countries , of the west offended and badly treated feel and now groups .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , exist between the two still large differences .
the largest difference is syria , where moscow gave itself recently the role as a peacemaker , but where opposite sides support russia and turkey .
it could be characteristic that after nearly three hours at erstgesprächen both presidents to the press conference stated that they would not have even touched the topic .
the president of turkey avoided to answer it intentionally to a question over its differences , during putin itself in addition decided these to stress .
no clear consent is present over it where a common denominator can be found to syria .
but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when the nato member turkey shot the russian fighter plane - it is surely better that the two heads of state talk again with one another at least .
royal bank of scotland for customers outside of scotland no longer available
the brand rbs is to be reduced according to the chief executive of the bank only more to a back office role .
royal bank of scotland for customers outside of scotland no longer will be available .
ross mcewan communicated scotland to the bbc that the brand rbs with the global ambitions of the bank were connected .
the bank dissociated itself since then , when it before eight years nearly collapsed and had to be saved .
in this time brand strategists used “ rbs ” to protect other final consumer financial brands .
it supported the international sport with millions pound at sponsoring , of the six nation rugby up to the wimbledon winner andy murray .
but now it decided to move more national brands into the focus .
royal bank of scotland only for customers in scotland will be available , but one will not initialize .
in england and wales all pucb becomes references , which changes decentralized head office and the stock exchange quotation to natwest .
the brand ulster bank is already used for customers in the republic of ireland and northern ireland .
there is other one , smaller brands for the private customer business , which will receive more meaning - coutts , adam &amp; co , drummond and holt &apos;s military bank .
mcewan was interviewed during an inspection tour by customers and employees into inverness shire .
it divided the bbc scotland with : “ the brand pucb will become now our investor brand as well as the brand , under which our employees will be employed , there we more a bank of brands . ”
when the bank became a global brand , rbs became the global brand .
i say now that we do not pursue global goals , but local of goals .
each of these brands will be located somewhat perfectly in their own communities for different one and our employees will become under these brands with the customers to work .
rbs already stated that its six nation sponsoring any longer it would not continue becomes and that it will increase the perceptibility of the different brands in its sport sponsoring .
“ it is time for us to develop to the bank of the brands because as we concentrate on the inside ( we have in demand ) to make this a better bank for customers ? ” the chief executive said .
it would have been before three years very cynical , if we had said that we will be for our customers a great bank and these brands would have launched .
but with our work , which on customer needs and our not own , i think focus , one many changes will see .
we can launch these brands again , from there think i that the time came .

frankie is not one the best jockey of the modern trend and it is a surprise that he reached this milestone , which only few reached before him .

of russia putin chief of staff sergei ivanov fires
russian president vladimir putin has unexpectedly his chief of staff sergei ivanov to dismiss .
ivanov was many years part of the closest confidence circle of putin .
the 63-year old was appointed the particular agent for environmental and transport affairs .
in a statement of the kremlin it reads that putin without giving reasons arranged “ the dismissal ivanovs of its obligations as a chairman of the russian presidential administration ” .
anton vaino , who was since 2012 ivanovs a deputy , was appointed his successor .
vaino , 44 , is former diplomat .
born , he made his conclusion at the renowned national one muscovite institut for international relations ( mgimo ) for 1972 in the estonian capital tallinn and worked in the message in tokyo .
on the website of the kremlin it ( on russian ) means that he was late minutes boss and staff leader of government staff .
about its appointment he said as putin : “ thanks for your confidence . ”
i think that it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as a head of state relative bills and controls for the conversion of your instructions .
putin communicated transmitters to the russian tv on friday that ivanov had asked to leave its post and vaino as its successor had recommended .
do the smiling faces convince ?
this step made moscow shrouded in mystery .
sergei ivanov was long time of one closest familiar vladimir putins and works as he for the soviet secret service , the kgb .
as a chief of staff it was one of the most powerful men that of country .
with a meeting with president both men maintained putin , who was on tv radiated , that the chief of staff withdraws on own desire .
but despite the smile for the cameras , here only few are of it convinced - above all now , shortly before the parliamentary elections .
is the subsequent of a kind struggle for power here thus present ?
at present nobody knows .
but the official statement - that a man , who was advertized once as a potential president would like to lead at once the russian environmental policy - encountered large skepticism .
in its remarks at putin , which are quoted on the website of the kremlin , ivanov said “ it is true that i had asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a discussion to entrust to me this very much complicated posts - one could almost say - cumbersome posts four years long .
as it turns out , i am since four years and eight months of chairmen of the russian presidential administration .
ivanov accepted the post in december 2011 .
before he was a deputy prime minister and secretary of defense .
it is member of the russian security council and like putin former member of the state security service kgb .
into the late 1990er years , when putin of chairmen of the federal security agency ( fsb ) was , the kgb , ivanov replaced its deputy was appointed .
as putin to power called it arrived ivanov as one of five people , which he to most familiar .
once it was accepted that ivanov could become after of putin second term of office president of russia , since a third term of office of putin would have offended against the condition .
but this post was taken by a further , intimate allied putin , dmitry medvedev .
putin became an prime minister , before it became three and a half years later again the president .

spd faction leader christoph bratmann means : “ we are us with the greens united : who wants to build on urban surfaces , in the future 20 percent of all apartments than subsidized low-rent housings must prove . ”
the favorable apartments can develop however also in the existence .
the large point at issue in the city hall is however , like that roasting man : “ as one deals with investors , those on private surfaces to build wants ? ”
“ we want that investors on such surfaces build at least 10 percent , but as 20 a percent of the apartments as possible as subsidized low-rent housings . ”
a new urban housebuilding advancement program , which will cost millions and still must be financed , is to provide for incentives .
the problem , so roasting man : “ there is momentarily still no agreement between the parliamentary groups . ”
the cdu would like to make if possible few regulations for investors .
the left one wants still hardens editions for investors .
regardless of its , so roasting man , is at hand an aggravation of the situation on the housing market .
if the action concept is converted , for additional tasks in the building authorities will provide .
more staff one needs .
it is unclear whether we will get the specialists .
still the program does not stand completely : because those approximately 1260 new apartments , which should anyway are built .
how however does one adjust the loss of further approximately 1300 favorable apartments , whose promotion will run out in the next years ?
however up to the year 2020 there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent , so the planning-political spokeswoman nicole palm , connections of the city , running out now , should be purchased .
in addition would have to be thought to get apartments again back into the application of fixed prices .
that is possible in weststadt .
at one blow the problem would let itself solve .
because run out in weststadt to the end of the year eking out .
one could get approximately 1800 apartments there back into the application of fixed prices for favorable apartments .
only : the owners , housing associations do not want that .
because the number of the subsidized low-rent housings in weststadt is increased again drastically , departs one from the goal of the so-called mixing .
a concentration of socialweak in only few quarters is not to give it any longer .
the greens count on the fact that it will give still movement in the discussion .
leader of the parliamentary group holger herlitschke means : “ for a broad majority the cdu must also in the boat . ”
those concentrated on more building sites for single family houses .
which however it does not mean that still another compromise cannot be found .
pokémon go , a hunt for health and luck , which are worthwhile themselves
it is to be watched fascinatingly , how the world changes .
the fact that teenagers and child do not go to no more to playing to outside was deplored but it rather to prefer to spend their spare time thereby at screens to stare , in the last decade by many .
with pokemon go goes it around getting and become more active letting people from the sofa to .
the time at the screen was at first limited to the television , then to video games and last to smartphones .
from there it is to be seen greatly that technology and activities in the free one are not mutually exclusive .
i refer thereby naturally to the pokémon go-illusion , an app , which is based on the characters , those first for the video games into the 1990ern to create ( later developed from it an indication trick series , playing cards and other spin offs ) .
like many phenomena of the popular culture the interest before the publication of the play sank in the usa , australia and new zealand at the beginning of july somewhat .
the introduction on the market in other countries was shifted by the substantial demand , which overloaded the servers .
within a few days pokémon go of more users than tinder and nearly so many had like twitter .
how does it function ?
briefly said the players with their smartphones go looking for outside and for pokémons , which are after-pursued with a gps and , as soon as they were once found , “ photographed ” ( over a screenshot on the mobile phone ) or to become “ imprisoned taken ” to be able .
a generation , which played the play , when it was still younger , followed the illusion and jumped for the search of the sofa .
in the usa the play led to a considerable rise at steps , which the “ average ” person puts back each day .
cardiogram , app for apple watch , which after-pursues 35,000 users , communicated washington post recently that within two days after introduction on the market of the play , which started number of of the after-pursued people , which train each day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the enterprise does not know , who plays of it pokémon go - it sees only the raw data for increase in output .
many public clearing-up campaigns to the health , the people to it to bring want “ 30 minutes time to take themselves , ” “ from the sofa to come ” and “ each day be active ” discovered deaf ears , because many public messages are boring to the health and come from people , which look miserable .
nevertheless the meaning of sport cannot be overestimated .
who drives regularly sport , reduces its opportunities to get sick with cancer or depressions .
physical manipulation helps with weight control to state high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list at advantages , which too long are , in order it here .
but the wonderful at pokémon go is that it brings the people to do something in the free one that them joke makes .
thus three columns of the health are taken off - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as joke .
some people close even new friendships on the hunt .
as there are always also grumpy spoilsports , who must always weight about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what is it ?
a break-through occurred .
even if smartphones apps could after-pursue such as fit bits already in former times our activity , they did not give us a reason to drift sport as it does this play .
the new will lose its attraction and will leave the use with the time .
due to pokemons success will give it however more plays , which will unite apps and virtual reality with in the real world and will help many people on the hunt , more actively , to be more fitter and healthier .

simone biles creates gold in the lady doing gymnastics
forget the pressure .
forget hype .
simone biles is immune on all that .
dynamically on the vaulting horse .
easy on the bar .
breath-taking one on the ground .
on whole line brilliantly .
and now finally also olympia winner .
the 19-year old american turnerin ascended on thursday to the multi-combat title and increased the gap between itself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the searchlight beam of the olympic games .
their total result of 62,198 was appropriate clearly before the silver medal winners and “ final five ” - for crew companion aly raisman and the russian bronze medal winner aliya mustafina .
the americans simone biles brazil does gymnastics , thursday on the balance beam during the single multi-combat final of the women in the artistic gymnastics with the olympic summer games in rio de janeiro 2016 .
biles is the fourth heterosexual american , some multi-combat title wins and altogether the fifth , while she strengthens her call to be the best one of their generation or even at all .
it broke out in tears , when their final result was shown and their be enough for travel in this moment an end found .
this success places it into the same league as singular athletes as michael phelps , which brought their kinds of sport to new heights :
biles won the last three years their kind of sport dominated , 15 world champion medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises , which contain a mixture from ambition and precision that the olympia winner said mary lou retton of 1984 of it that it is “ the best turnerin , which i ever saw . ”
it expected it a last examination in brazil , a competition , which did not go so much between biles and the rest of the athletes , but rather between it and a load of oversized expectations .
not with a handful of gold back to the family in jump , texas return , would be as disappointment to be viewed .
the americans simone biles , left , and aly raisman embrace themselves , after they won in each case gold and silver in the single multi-combat final of the women in the artistic gymnastics with the olympic summer games 2016 in rio de janeiro , brazil , thursday ,
biles got the first medal on tuesday , while she served herself on the parting celebration of the crew co-ordinator martha karolyi committing in retirement as exclamation mark .
although biles insisted on it , during its long way on the point , the future to have never planned , is not really true that .
a part of their ground exercises - which contain its typical tumbling passport - is co-ordinated with latin american music , which would fit at home on the road outside of the olympia arena in rio .
that is not coincidence .
this girl , who was adopted of its grandparents as a small child and discovered of coach aimee boormans mother during a school trip into the gymnasium , in the boorman trained , became the strength .
it lost no more multi-combat competition since the summer 2013 , a winning streak , which will so for a long time continue , as it wishes biles .
even if mustafina led by two turns easily , the picture trügte .
balance beams and floor exercises - in those biles the world champion title holds - lay in wait .
it got again with 15,433 on the balance beam - and set with 15.933 on the ground still a one on it .
raisman embraced it gently as it their endergbnis expected - a pure formality - and tears flowed on biles shining red , white and blue eyeliner , when the vision , which described it once in her collecting book , became the reality .
the achievement raismans was a revenge for the last mark before four years , when it fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a tiebrake at mustafina went .
this time the 22-year old captain , who is called by the americans “ granny ” , had a lead .
after its ground exercise she threw kiss hands to the audience , overwhelmed from a comeback , which appeared doubtful sometimes .
which concerns biles , then the fast spreading tweet of the 19-year old has earlier this week a completely new meaning of :

the symptoms and prognoses can vary strongly .
it is to be said still too early , how infected it the life with the zikavirus will affect .
picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future .
i constantly asked , what will happened ?
what will happen ?
and it does not know it yet really .
i did not ask already for a long time no more for the prognosis , because i do not expect that she can really say someone to me .
but picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of babies with birth damage , which was caused by the zikavirus .
it becomes better .
they know that it will become better for you .
they will love your child and become your child you to love .

why we need simone , gabby and laurie
that is , which i introduce myself under the woman olympic team in doing gymnastics and which from more than one reason .
first of all i participate since 1984 with each summer olympic games and the usa was never so dominantly .
and secondly : this crew has three turn gutters , simone biles , gabby douglas and lauren “ laurie ” hernandez , which worked for many young girls of other skin color inspiring .
structure this crew , which aly raisman , which is jew and is madison kocian , the catholic , round off , make everyone proudly .
this crew reflects finally the usa .
it solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the point of this kind of sport .
in the last four years the number one was under the female turn gutters an afro american .
last year were simone and gabby # 1 and # 2 .
that shows strength .
with the last olympic games a gabby douglas &apos;s was surprising olympia winner and america was jubilant .
now the world in the position , a witness of the unbelievable achievement of the three-way world champion simone biles was to be douglas and laurie hernandez like it unexpected , but masterful gymastikroutinen supplied .
on thursday simone became the fourth , heterosexual american , who won during an individual multi-combat event for women gold .
crew member aly raisman won silver .
we experience the point of this kind of sport , but turn classes do not look generally speaking country in such a way .
simone , gabby and laurie knocked all the same way as aly and madison , in order to create it into the olympic team .
they are the “ last five ” , because the next olympic team will have only four turn gutters in the crew . in addition that is the last year with marta karolyi as a coach .
but the reality looks in such a way that doing gymnastics an expensive sport is and gymnasts are responsible primarily in private gymnastics clubs , which will maintain from parents those for the training , facility , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the coaches and their gymnast and families ) . the list can be continued at will .
the majority of these gymnastics clubs lie in wealthy suburbs , which can support the business .
in these clubs the gymnasts receive their entire training and that are for the families an expensive and long-term commitment .
aimee boorman , trainerin of simone biles , and maggie haney , trainerin of laurie hernandez , have both their athletes to have trained , since then her with doing gymnastics to have begun .
we must make aun innumerable , young girls , who are inspired by simone , gabby and laurie , for the communities possible a leistbareres and more easily accessible turntrainung .
i created my turn foundation of 20 years .
with my events we ordered free and affordable doing gymnastics in harlem for over 15.000 urban young people ( above all black and hispanic ) and trained national and international winners .
in september we will expand to detroit ( my hometown ) , in order to offer to the youth high-quality doing gymnastics , which earn the possibility of learning and of profiting from this great olympic kind of sport to .
do gymnastics develop strength , flexibility and co-ordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and certainty for the spirit .
this combination offers lifelong advantages for the health as well as for school and vocational success .
the inspiration of this crew , which thousand young girls bring to it , is to be interested in doing gymnastics and that is great .
it is so important to participate in the sport particularly for girls .
that is a in such a way stretching time .
thank if simone , aly , laurie , gabby and madison for this genuine representation of “ girl power ” by getting the olympic crew gold and , if barrel it thanks so many young girls with different background motivated to become in order to begin their way , healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistant physicians would like to organize further strikes , after they rejected jeremy hunts &apos;s proposal
the ministers had hoped to be able to terminate the controversy over the changes by acceptance of a reformed contract with the functionaries that british medical association but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistant physicians , who co-ordinated with a choice , rejected it .
in july hunt pläne had revealed , whom contract said obligatorily to introduce and the fact that in a “ no man &apos;s land ” would be nhs and each further delay for the employees and patient would be harmful .
the first assistant physicians are to receive a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekend works , in order to improve the care to inhospitable times .
dr ellen mccourt , the chairman of the bma kommittees for assistant physicians divided last night in a report with : “ assistant physicians have serious doubts to the suggested contract still to treat all physicians fairly in particular that it will neglect the present staff crisis to heat up and it . ”
at only eight weeks , which still remain , until the first group of physicians under the new contract fall , must progress are made and the time runs out .
efforts on the part of the bma for the solution of the disputes by discussions encountered at the government on aversions to take part and sometimes deafening silence .
that happened the one promise , which had made jeremy hunt only last month over the fact that its door would always be open .
“ jeremy hunt must now act , which waive imposition and which concerns of the assistant physicians address ” .
if he should not do this , then the assistant physicians made it clear that they are ready to accomplish further forms of industrial action .
the last strike at the end of april planned a delay of almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 dates , since nurses and specialists were included , in order to grant physicians on the picket line covering .
the ministers had hoped to be able to terminate the controversy over the changes by an acceptance of the reformed contract with the functionaries that british medical association .
the bma would like a better wochendentlohnung for the 54,000 assistant physicians , who will be subject to the contract .
daniel mortimer , general manager of nhs of the employees , requested the assistant physicians to terminate the strike .
mortimer said : “ forms of industrial action reach nothing the only few , load however teams and service providers already over-burdening and prepare the patients , male nurses and its families only concerns , emergency and interruption . ”
in the last two months we spoke me the committee of the assistant physicians and with the ministry of health as well as other ministries positively to the doubts regarding the guardianship and the whistleblowings answered .
the employers hoped that the continued positive commitment about other important - like delegation , flexibility with training courses , additional training courses for those , which return from a vocational time-out , schulungsksten , mutual acknowledgment of the curriculum , study leave and the gender pay gap in the medicine - an indication of it were , like seriously it the employers , which was health education england and the ministry of health concerning the adherence to the agreements with the bma in november , february and may .
the £ 2-pro day medicine , the cardiac infarct risk to lower can
thousands of heart attack patients will profit from a £ 2-pro day medicine , after by the authorities one recommended to give this to more people for a longer period .
the coagulate-restraining medicine ticagrelor reduces the risk of repetitive cardiac infarcts for people with a heart illness .
the medicine is given already 12 months long after a cardiac infarct , whereby the risk of an apoplexy or a further cardiac infarct is reduced .
the regulatory authority nice of nhs recommended a four years long income , in order to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems further .
the regulatory authority nice of nhs recommended a four years long income , in order to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems further .
approximately 140,000 people suffer each year a cardiac infarct and a quarter of it suffer a further cardiac infarct or an apoplexy .
cardiac infarcts and apoplexies are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the arterial walls , which form surfaces .
if the surface breaks apart , it can cause a blood clot , which causes flow of blood up to the heart clogged and thus a cardiac infarct .
if the blood clot separates , it can flow by the bloodstream and clog flow of blood to the brain , which causes an apoplexy .
people , who had already a cardiac infarct , are subject to a higher risk a further to have .
ticagrelor , which is manufactured by the british enterprise astrazeneca and under the trade name brilique is driven out , reduces this risk , by making the formation of blood clots more improbable .
the instruction draft of nice , which was today published , recommends a 12-month income of 90mg ticagrelor , followed from 60mg with a twice daily income of aspirin for the next three years .
professor carole longson , direktorin of the nice of health technology evaluation center said : “ a quarter of all people , who suffered a cardiac infarct , has defiance of the availability of secondary prevention a further cardiac infarct or an apoplexy - often with disastrous consequences . ”
the fear of a renewed cardiac infarct can have substantial negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that ticagrelor is effective in combination with aspirin with the reduction of further cardiac infarcts and apoplexies at people , which had already a cardiac infarct .
by a provisional recommendation of ticagrelor we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of humans who can profit from it .
the information about the effectiveness and security of ticagrelor - above all the bleeding risk - are limited to one period of up to three years . the instruction draft does not recommend treatment , which goes beyond this period .
culture of the political correctness lets electoral fraud in muslim areas blossom
the former mayor von tower hamlets lutfur rahman was removed last year on reason of a government report because of corruption from the office
a culture of the political correctness led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in muslim communities is knowingly ignored like a destroying government report today revealed .
the former cabinet member sir eric pickles attacks verbal the police , election observer and city halls proofs of choice abuse due to “ hypersensitivenesses concerning ethnicity and religion ” to have ignored .
the former minister for integration and local government , which are now a antkorruptionskönig , it said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that it should be permitted the police to furnish shut-off volumes outside from polling booths in order intimidated voters to protect .
it recommends that voters should lead a document of identification with itself , in order to prove with elections their identity .
at present a voter must call only its name and address .
the report suggests laying not removable ink on on the finger of a person if they deliver their vote , in order to prevent that someone selects twice .
whistleblower should receive more protection , say sir eric .
it demands that the press more entrance to community documents and decisions of not official kommittees or working groups should have .
“ also the local government before the broader corruption and finance fraud culture , which accompany with it , does not only serve protects , ” said it against electoral fraud , but is .
the report was arranged of the downing street as consequence of the tower hamlets of choice scandal in the east of london .
last year decided a special choice court that the acting mayor lutfur rahman should be relieved after a litany at corrupt and illegal practices of his office .
the court found that rahman the religious feelings of its muslim community would have perverted &quot; in cynical way ” and that it would have hushed its critics with racing sis mash and islamophobienanschuldigungen .
rahman is to have led “ its campaign on the basis that it is the religöse obligation of muslims , it to select . ”
up to 300 voices were either doubtful or the consequence of an imitation , with which a person selects as someone else .
sir eric said that there would be generally speaking country of proofs for fraud .
he expressed himself in particular alarming to the fraudulent absentee voting - at older members would have made the muslim community pressure on people to select a candidate of their choice .
sir eric , shown , made several recommendations , in order to clean the choice system , including leading documents of identification , in order to prove the identity
in its report it means : “ as proof it was attached that pressure was exerted on members in need of protection of some ethnic minorities , in particular women and young people , in order to select in accordance with the will the older ones , in particular communities with background of pakistan or of bangladesh .
“ there were doubts that … national institutions would knowingly have ignored such a behavior due to “ politically correct ” hypersensitivenesses concerning the ethnicity and religion . ”
sir eric expressed 50 recommendations , in order to clean the system to stop including the prohibition that political activists works on absentee voting documents , in order “ choice elections ” .
the report , which is considered by theresa may , requires also harder registration examinations , in order to prevent that the choice listing is used for immigration and social fraud purposes .
options consider to ask voters before the choice for your document of identification .
do not use removable ink on the finger of a person , as soon as it delivered her voice , in order to prevent that someone selects twice .
to accomplish systematic examinations over the nationality of a person , in order to guarantee that they are entitled to vote .
a three-year delimitation on requests for an automatic absentee voting .

turkey : kurdish community counts on mass escape
“ who does not adapt and on packed suit-cases ” the presiding of the gulnear foundation dialogue and world , ercan karakoyun praises , sits , says erdogan .
the kurdish community germany counts at short notice on ten thousand protection-searching , which flee from turkey to germany .
in the medium term it could become even “ some hundred thousand ” , believes the association chairman ali toprak .
because of the hard action of turkish president recep tayyip erdogan after the putsch attempt the kurdish community germany expects a mass escape to germany .
“ i count short term on ten thousands , in the medium term on some hundred thousand protection-searching from turkey in germany , if the erdogan regime says the minorities and the democratic opposition further fought ” , the association chairman ali toprak of the “ world ” of friday .
because the government already covered months ago kurdish centers with punitive actions , 500,000 kurds are within turkey on the escape .
after the defeated putsch still secular and oppositional ethnic turks would be added .
many will want to again begin in europe , if they are continued to suppress in turkey .
“ it cannot be that a state , which accepts even refugees in the own country refugees produced ” , it said to toprak .
the federation boss deplored the purposeful settlement of syrian arabs in kurdish , in addition , in alevitischen cities .
thus erdogan wants to increase the departure printing to the remaining kurds .
“ you are the last large minority in turkey , those christian armenian and greek already in the past hundred years were exterminated or driven out ” , said toprak , who is also cdu member .
the federation boss demanded that the federal government positions itself “ as sharply as austria against erdogan and its supporters ” .
also in germany take place a “ witch-hunt ” against erdogan critics .
i do not feel in the last months for the first time any longer reliably in germany .
the german branch of the gul movement fears likewise the escape of many turks abroad .
more turk , above all kurds and oppositionals will look for asylum in germany .
stigmatization as gul supporters destroys teachers and other university graduates the vocational existence .
“ who does not adapt and erdogan on packed suit-cases , by the way also the kemalisten and said secular one ” praise , sit , to ercan karakoyun , chairman of the gulnear foundation dialogue and education , the “ world ” .
as the newspaper reports with reference to numbers of the federal ministry of the interior , the turks already placed the largest group of the people entitled to asylum recognized because of political pursuit before the putsch in germany .
to the deadline 30 june this 11,386 humans and thus scarcely 29 percent were everything as asylum-entitled appreciative one ( 39.625 ) .
in this collection before war , poverty or lack of perspectives the fleeing are not .
after the basic law are asylum-entitled excluding political , thus from national side , individually pursued .
mecklenburg-western pomerania : “ there goes , where it hurts ”
strange mecklenburg-western pomerania : the native ones do not receive anything from the summer election campaign - and the holiday-makers from north rhine-westphalia may not select the federal state parliament .
in mecklenburg-western pomerania they understood .
2021 already did not decide the election of the federal parliament again directly in the end summer holidays to take place , the schweriner parliament at the beginning of the year .
because dumber than so far it does not go : summer holidays , heat and election campaign for the landtag - bites itself .
the native ones , which are to be convinced by the election campaigners , are on vacation .
the most holiday-makers , who are in the country , on usedom , reproaches or hiddensee on the way , are not native ones , may thus not the federal state parliament select .
in addition practical problems come : in holidays aides , that hang posters up , are ballons blow up , flyers distribute and in the end voting count out to find only laboriously .
by 4 september 2016 , choice and last holidays day , mecklenburg-western pomerania must let past be issued once still election campaign scarcely at the people over itself .
the hot phase , if one can say that at all , began straight .
and it concerns also somewhat : prime minister erwin sellering , anführer of a spd / cdu coalition , must be afraid for his office .
the spd , since 1998 a strongest party , lies now in surveys clearly behind the cdu .
becomes exciting , as strongly beginner afd cuts off and which in the end coalition-suited remains remaining .
sellering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes a nearly inconspicuously working election campaign , sieved one from its large posters .
it travels by the country , distributes roses and plauscht a little with the people , as it already his legendarily word-meager predecessor harald ringstorff did .
otherwise soul ring got and gives cold feet chancellor merkel the debt at blooming the afd .
their refugee politics , it “ we create ” the ascent of the right populists accelerated , which will probably cost it now the beautiful office .
the cdu with their leading candidate , who minister of the interior lorenz caffier , has already experienced , how it is , if one makes election campaign the wrong time at the correct place .
it invited twice chancellor angela merkel to large demonstrations ; merkel election to the bundestag circle lies in the northeast .
but the target audience did not tune , it was more norths rhine-westphalia , citizen of berlin and saxony there than mecklenburger and west pomerania .
“ there the majority from other federal states ” was probable , complained vincent kokert , secretary-general of the cdu in mecklenburg-western pomerania , recently in the ndr .
but it harms also nobody from other corners of germany to listen once to angela merkel .
otherwise the northeast cdu does to a large extent without the usual election campaign conditions on market places and before shopping centres with parasols and ballons .
that , then means kokert , plays only a “ subordinated role ” .
also the union noticed that you wegbröselt on the country the basis that it must exert much to find again a wire to the people .
you go it like that to linking , the spd , the green : in the widths of the country hardly available .
the advice of the cdu election campaigner kokert to its fellow combatants is however also exposing : “ you must go there , where it hurts , i.e. where humans are : village festivals , golden weddings , each birthday party must be used ” .
because much stands on the play , sellering called its spd now to a particularly engaged election campaign .
in surveys the social democrats lay last with 22 percent behind partner cdu ( 25 ) and only scarcely before the afd ( 19 ) .
with the choice 2011 the spd had won still clearly with 35,6 percent before the cdu ( 22 ) .
the greens , a small party with seven percent in the surveys , might create the leap into the federal state parliament .
they make a modern virtue from the holidays emergency and move their election campaign mostly in the internet .
“ online election campaign ” , calls it the regional chairmen claudia müller .
otherwise go green election campaigners on tracing after native voting citizens among the holiday-makers .
silke gajek , the leading candidate , circles straight with a houseboat by the mecklenburgian seas and finds it also still beautiful .
their impression : “ choice vacation in mecklenburg-western pomerania is not a punishment ” .
b27-sanierung : restaurants suffer from blockage
at the speed , with which b 27 one reorganizes , it gives to grumble nothing .
for the responsible persons of the construction work , which begins in the morning at 5.30 o &apos;clock and ends only around 20 o &apos;clock , there is everywhere praise .
“ those made , tell everything rather jaggedly ” elvira tetzlaff of the jet gas station .
that is a superteam .
there is also no delay .
the building site could be moved at the beginning of the week to the half time according to plan after the south , to at the end of octobers should everything be finished .
also the obligingness for the construction work of the responsible persons is praised , about if it concerns the facility from auxiliary entries .
since the building site hiked on monday after the south and also the blockage of the aspergstraße in ofterdingen was waived and so that also the connection exists to rottenburg again , the traffic conditions relaxed within the place .
the citizens can drive on now from ofterdingen from b 27 again reciprocally .
alternate traffic by the place seems to decrease .
“ there it gave partial substantial complaints ” , says for the traffic-technical management of the redevelopment responsible person deputy municipal managers to florian king .
the adjacents resident of brook sentence road , stone salmon route , hafnerstraße and weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many secret means looked for each other and rather trusted their navi as the sign-posting .
which led to the fact that some truck in populated areas verfranste itself .
since also the speed limits were not kept , demanded the community strengthens the measuring vehicle from mössingen on .
“ there were substantial excesses ” , say king , which made itself well-informed over the situation times locally .
there two to three per minute were already flashed .
the fastest one was with 77 kilometers per hour in the tempo-30-zone on the way .
since the building site moved on , it became however calmer .
for the businessmen at b 27 it is only a small comfort that for customers from rottenburg now the road is again open .
into the cards to look businessmen do not leave themselves gladly .
but that with them to revenue break-downs led b 27-sanierung , it lets see through everyone , which one asks .
however some more are less concerned and some .
who has to do with the “ end customers ” less , thus for other companies produced , for that the redevelopment has hardly consequences .
in addition , also with the car dealership maier speaks thomas sulz of a “ at the most easy decrease ” , grants that naturally “ irregular customers are missing ” .
at the strongest shaken the restaurants are along the road .
j. albert göhner , inhaber of the steakhouse , before times crown , finds clear words .
that already is existence-threatening .
not only it met it , but all restaurants “ hard ” .
the customers from hechingen , balingen and rottweil were missing .
we must be glad over each euro revenue .
it numbers the turnover losses on “ far over 50 percent ” .
the road redevelopment threw its enterprise back “ by two years ” .
it half of its employees had to dismiss .
if i had a company with 4000 employees and half were to dismiss , had the policy differently reacted .
instead head of the provincial government jörg schmidt answered to a request of göhner , whether there could be a financial reconciliation , with the reference , the restaurant profits otherwise from the advantages the situation at b 27 . now it must carry just also the disadvantages , which arise as a result of the redevelopment .
göhner knows from other districts , where something so more generously one handled .
with all complaints göhner is sure itself that its restaurant will continue .
finally the family business is settled already since here 1715 , refers it to long history .
that other regular customers look in now because of the complicated traffic management less frequently , he can understand .
if one cannot to drive here , it is also elsewhere beautiful .
that its master clientele returns after the end of the repair works again , to it göhner does not have doubts .
despite the crises with bse and bird flu göhner regards the effects of b 27-bauarbeiten its customers as the largest crisis , which experienced its restaurant in its history of many years .
six months construction work , that is already brutal .
constantly in the name of the fight against terror at laws one screws .
after the recent attacks minister of the interior de maizière submits now a thick safety package .
but which has a tolerance status with terror to do ?
and which says the coalition partner to all that ?
thomas de maizière gives the versöhner .
all its proposals are “ politically reasonable ” the coalition partner , say the federal minister of the interior with the conception of its new safety package .
they do not make excessive demands of anybody .
others , large points were discussed first within the parties .
also to it i take part .
as a minister of the interior is however at results been to it and because of a “ attainable consent ” within the coalition .
de maizière let little time elapse after the recent attacks in wuerzburg and ansbach , before he presents his conclusions for security in the republic .
fail for it now however all the more extensively .
some is already well-known , announced , focused : the fact that a new security authority is to worry about cracking coded communication is not new .
also not the fact that germany must convert several european union-defaults to aircraft passenger data and gun law .
the call to more closed circuit television and staff for the security authorities does not come just as surprisingly .
partially de maizière starts a second approach for proposals , which were not to be made with the spd so far : it wants sympathy advertisement for terrorist groups under punishment to place and to jihadists with double nationality the german passport unbutton .
“ that difficult points will be for the spd ” , grant the cdu man .
it hold this nevertheless for reasonable and demand also nothing that has no opportunities at the coalition partner anyway .
de maizière presents a few new ideas also .
those have it partly in itself : it plans shortened proceedings for deportation and more possibilities for the arrest of humans before the deportation .
refugees , who are gotten purposefully in the country , are to let their smartphones check before and social media accounts for a security examination to reveal .
with tolerances for rejected asylum seekers it wants to place some still more badly than so far - for instance such , which commit criminal offences or throw their papers away consciously , in order to mask their identity .
some of it is politically and legally delicate .
some works also still ill-considered and leaves questions open .
and at some points - with the discrimination of waited one for example - the question arises : what has to do actually with security and terror ?
yes , de maizière , says is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be placed in agreement that the assassins of ansbach and wuerzburg were refugees .
in addition many humans worryd themselves in view of the high refugee numbers around security .
and things , which employed humans deeply , did not let themselves exclude just also in election campaign times .
internal security moved enormously into the focus .
only the attacks in the neighbourhood : paris , copenhagen , brussels , nice .
then the attacks in wuerzburg and ansbach .
the disconcertion is large .
and yes , election campaigns line up .
union and spd position themselves with the topic internal security from there increasingly .
in the past days it worked between the two parties highly .
only a mean controversy over the equipment of the federal police , then over a security-political idea collection of some union ministers of the interior , in which the department heads demand also a burka prohibition and a break with the double nationality .
de maizière strives itself also here around conciliatory tones .
from a break with the double passport do not think it anything .
we pacified the discussion in germany .
it to open again , is not meaningful .
and with a burka prohibition it has constitutional doubts .
whether its own package at all corners is verfassungsfest and whether it is actually “ reasonable ” for the coalition partner , must itself only still show .
it puts some in it , which could provide for controversy .
but also the spd tries at present to form itself with the topic internal security .
party chief sigmar gabriel signaled only times carefully willingness to have talks and says : “ the spd is ready to talk about everything which contributes to it , security further to increase ” .
still volkswagen comes through mildly .
despite diesel scandal the distribution numbers rise world-wide .
but not in all markets it runs approximately .
with the recall action there is eddy around a term .
volkswagen starts with the distribution more with restraint into the second half-year .
of europe of largest car makers can show in the past course of the year despite the diesel affair owing to his many brands and some well running markets of a far plus .
but in july the core brand volkswagen slacked off particularly in western europe and loaded with again the total sale as the enterprise noted in the dax communicated .
world-wide the brand volkswagen sold 1.8 percent of fewer vehicles than in july with 449100 cars the previous year month .
however in western europe , to china the second most important market , the sales were 14 percent under the previous year month .
in the domestic market the distribution sagged germany around nearly a sixth .
brand distribution boss of jürgen stackmann led back the weaker numbers from july particularly to two sales days less into europe .
besides it gave a consumer resistance in some nuclear markets by “ changed economic basic conditions ” .
apart from the situation around the putsch attempt in turkey also the british vote loaded approximately to the withdrawal from the european union , described a spokeswoman .
in the usa , where the exhaust affair escalated first , it is located a likewise far minus to beech .
large support for volkswagen is the chinese market .
altogether the own brand mainly concerned that comes lower saxony anyway further mildly by the diesel scandal : after the first seven months only a distribution minus from 0,9 percent stands to 3.37 million vehicles to beech .
company distribution boss of fred kappler could show from january to july of far sales sale .
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered volkswagen in this time , world-wide 5.904 million .
volkswagen had manipulated exhaust tests with a software .
alone in germany volkswagen calls approximately 2.5 million car for re-equipment into the workshops .
in the course of the re-equipment volkswagen affirmed that the change of the cars does not have negative effects .
after the re-equipment of the vehicles give it during fuel consumption , co2 emissions or engine performance to no degradation .
the car maker issues the customer after the re-equipment a “ warranty-same ” certificate , speak however not of a “ warranty ” , as it meant on friday in company sources .
reason are legal intricacies .
“ focus ” had reported , volkswagen grants to its german customers now nevertheless a warranty for reequipped diesel models .
on past monday volkswagen representatives in the federal ministry of transport would have confirmed this .
from the ministry of transport it was confirmed that there was this meeting .
“ volkswagen has to fulfill the editions of my commission of inquiry and the kba at full extent . ”
“ deviations from it are not accepted ” , explained federal ministers of transport alexander dobrindt ( csu ) according to ministry .
volkswagen took over the warranty that at fuel consumption , co2 emissions or engine performance after the re-equipment no degradations to take place and all type-approval-relevant vehicle values invariably existence to have .
volkswagen does not use the term “ warranty ” however , as it meant in company sources .
with the far term “ warranty ” sees the possibility to volkswagen the fact that customers come for example a half year to the re-equipment for instance with a damage to the engine into a workshop - and to the new software to attribute could do this , even if the damage thereby has to do nothing .
also in the interest of customer is important it to avoid that it comes with any other damage , which does not have to do nothing at all with the exhaust scandal to disconcertion regarding possible guarantee regulations , as it meant .
therefore do not use volkswagen the term “ warranty ” .
the raiffeisen bank gmund at the tegernsee required of rich savers in the future penalty interest - as second institut in germany .
bank boss josef paul said on thursday : “ it concerns only 139 customers , who park 40 million euros on giro or call money accounts ” .
the federal association of german banks speaks of an individual case and sees therein no signal : normal savers would not have “ to fear , for their savings groschens penalty rate to pay ” .
over night with the european central bank ( ezb ) , they must pay their 0.4 percent of penalty rate to camps banks money .
this fee requires the raiffeisen bank gmund starting from september von privat- and firmenkunden for inserts over 100,000 euros on giro or call money accounts back .
“ the first 100,000 euros are free . ”
“ the next 100,000 costs in the future 400 euros in the year ” , said paul .
he guard for quite some time 40 million euros , which could be taken off from one day on the others and which it could not use .
“ costs ” are , said the bank boss with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent .
“ i cannot put for each million 4000 euros down . ”
pass the costs on it after the causer pays principle now .
the cash simply in the safe deposits of the raiffeisen bank lie to let , would be much too dangerous : “ i experienced already four assaults , i would not like still fifth ! ” , the bank executive committee said .
most customers would have understanding and changed on other investment vehicles .
only few moved away to other banks .
the cooperative federation bavaria explained : “ the extreme monetary political course of the ezb causes substantial costs ” with all banks .
it alone to carry , is “ economically permanently not possible ” .
some german banks increased therefore their fees for account processing , credit cards or transfers .
with penalty interest for inserts starting from three million euros the thuringians people and raiffeisen bank altenburger country with their skat branch bank 2014 headlines had made .
michael kemmer , hauptgeschäftsführer of the bank federation , said : “ we do not expect that private customers surface covering repay for inserts pay must , in addition are much too strong the competition in germany under banks and savings banks ” .
a banker said , at the tegernsee gives it “ a clientele , which is somewhat more sumptuously equipped by the fortune ” .
“ that can become for a small bank the problem ” , if she guards money free of charge .
the 1911 created loan bank gmund has branches in bad wiessee , rottach egern , kreuth and tegernsee .
in the region live well-known actors , sportsman and entrepreneur .
the cooperative federation bavaria “ at present no further banks are well-known , which compute , said a display replacement for inserts of private customers ” spokesman ernst .
the president of the federal association of the german people banks and raiffeisen banks ( bvr ) , uwe merry , had explained at the end of june : “ the threshold , into negatives to go opposite the private customer , is very , very high ” .
the competition is hard , and the drift from investors threatens to the competition .
the customers in germany will not leave themselves fallen in the width .
destination plates : who actually buys records ?
lonely men of middle age love plates .
before you rush to the comment part , in order to scatter it under the alias nichtalleeinsamenmännermittlerenalters with rough offenses , this statement is derived from current data .
according to yougov the much-discussed rerising of records is on one does not boom in millennials , which want to welcome the news of physical articles to attribute but to midlife nostalgia .
those , which bought recently a plate , are in all probability in the age between 45 and 54 .
indeed the age group of 18-24 is the most improbable buyer category .
it is also no hordes through hobby collecting tanks - it has an emotional meaning : older disk buyers keep their feelings rather for itself ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it spending alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but the results of yougov are correct ?
if these blogs a news report on tv were , the camera would follow me , while i run in the midst of a busy road in soho , a modest grey suit carries and wildly gestuliere , before i stop , my hands to hold and something determining said how : “ thus , you let a closer look on it throw us . ”
thus , you let a view of it throw us .
even if the heart sohos loses slowly at its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices fill now the buildings , in which once independent salespersen resided - still gives it a handful of fantastic disk special firms .
i would probably ask the cameraman to switch the camera off for the next part in which i am located and tried in direct proximity to different men in such business to estimate their age and mind by observation .
stuart from glasgow , 55 , which i of sister ray ( data &apos;s number : two young women , three men of middle age ) in the reckless record ( data &apos;s number : eight men of middle age , a woman , probably in order the 20 ) follow , is long one day because of a meeting into london and goes through the business , in order to fill those few hours .
is it a collecting tank , asks i ?
“ i estimate already , ” say he .
i have approx . 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
these records , above shown ( it sent the snapshot to me by email , did not follow i it home ) , line the walls of its living room .
the reason , why it possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of its available income : he now is able to buy plates which it could not afford to buy as it published and again articles which it sold , when it was young and broke .
“ many things , which i buy , are from the late 60ern , early 70ern , which appeared , when i was 11 or 12 . ” he says things , with which i was too young probably somewhat , in order to buy her to me .
it agrees that and it adds those , which buy plates , rather introverted are and gladly alone time spend : “ i do not smoke and i drink not very much .
that is my vice .
wez , 25 , which works at sister ray , believes also that many customers , whom it meets apply to the yougov profile .
he noticed however also a new wave at people , which are affected by the medienhpe , people , which heard over the comeback and itself arranges to see to buy again their old plates .
from the discussions , which i led , people got rid of their collection usually in such a way around 1998 or 1999 .
customers , who sold once their plates , in order to buy cds , sell now their cds , in order to buy again their plates , ” say it .
that will boom at supporters of the disk revival of a certain age to explain .
but which is with the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
it takes only some seconds in a business such as phonica , in order to recognize that a reassuring community of like-minded ones offers disk business .
according to wez took some the older customers impact at the contactless payment system .
some disk fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw itself to stability from familiar record coverings , from articles , which evoke happy youthful memories .
“ i think , sometimes can it filling an emptiness or the possession of material properties as a kind comfort be , ” say wez .
that is with me as collecting tank like that and i thinks that it is at many people like that .
it is a simple way to be occupied mentally .
“ we are like their social workers ! ” an employee from a disk pack pipes .
a survey of the icm in april revealed that nearly 50 % of the people , which bought last month a plate did not belong it yet .
the survey also found out the fact that 41 % possess a record player , which they never use , while 7 % those , which buy a plate , does not possess a record player .
at this time the news report i to look probably very anxious , while i leaf by a pile at bossa new facts compilations .
jonny , 42 , that with sounds of the university universities of ( data &apos;s number : three men of middle age ) , “ aspect of trophy ” of the revival works noticed .
“ someone came in only recently here and said : “ i do not possess a record player , but i would buy gladly a radiohead record , so that i can place her in the shelf , ” say he .
this is not a large percentage , but it happens definitely .
more produktlastig , less musiklastig .
we have people , which say : “ i do not have a record player . ”
those are younger people , not older , which come in only slowly .
tease , which dedicated nearly a whole floor to the records , a more multicolored audience has , than i go in .
it gives pairs around the 70 , tourists , who make photos , tea-gnaw-young and to women of middle age .
even if the atmosphere roars somewhat less relaxed than into that to business managing specified actual game beasts of more newly synthesizer and sexbepackter pop in place of experimental jazz from the loudspeakers - it to see is good , such a diversity at the customers .
none of them looks particularly lonely , but gnawing psychological traumata can be recognized with difficulty , if one stands beside someone 30 seconds long .
elanora , 27 , runs around for some minutes in the business and regards the variety of the plates standing to the sale .
it makes rather one shop window-strolls as a bulk buying .
she does not earn much , therefore collecting plates is not a real option , says it .
it costs much .
it is to be heard easily music by a computer or on other way , but the beauty of plates is … ” it drives off with a sigh fallen in love .
i do not know , as i it to explain am - it is really singular .
my last stop is a business , by which it is said that a new generation of disk lovers is to have inspired : urban outfitters .
while i give the appearance to examine the jeans hot pant i observe a group of young tea gnawing girls , who group themselves for one moment around polaroid cameras , before a father and its daughter consider themselves , a crosley record players to buy .
to linking is a stairway , a wall of full plates of ennobles , jeff buckley , amy winehouse and fleetwood mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classical authors , the essential plates for an average collection .
nobody sees itself it to on perhaps , because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch her .
it is pure “ disk art ” .
but considering its that for the industry it means each attraction for these articles more funds and into the depths sohos for more fancy would know some customers , it does not give it to anything , in order to weight .
it is not a surprise that a subpopulation , which has more time and money than others is also that , which spends at most on luxury articles such as plates .
even if my investigations showed that results of yougov are correct , leave it , at least in disk business in soho , which large number of female collectors and disk lovers , which exist in the reality , disk business and in online forums , unconsidered .
these humans work probably hard at school or in offices .
they do not spend their thursday tomorrow with security with strolling by disk business of berwick street and leafing by plates , while they avoid the staring view uncanny , 30-year old wrong moderator , which rises over the shoulders nothing suspecting men of middle age .

french court rejects offer over outline of business in the jungle refugee camp
a french court an offer of the authorities in calais rejected to pull down dozens of provisional business and restaurants in the jungle of calais , in which thousands of refugees lives .

the impressing achievement of great britain with the 7-er rugby came in the final on thursday evening to an abrupt stop with the last hurdle in form of the fijis , when they were struck here with a result of 43-7 in the deodoro stage in rio .
fiji gave a master class in the handling , side stepping , advancing , line run and raw strength , in order to win gold - their first olympia medal of any color .
the defeat was sweetened by not too the comfort small comfort the silver medal - of great britain fourth on this day - and they could be quite proud on their efforts in this tournament , in that them new zealand , argentina and south africa struck .
the clear defeat of the boks , 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could drop back to it in the final .
but independently of it fiji would have struck with this form a 15-mann-team in best form .
it could be for gb a comfort - however will it probably non that at least a britisher tomorrow a gold medal around its neck to hang to have : fijis coach ben ryan , the former boss for england from wimbledon .
gb had a difficult way behind itself .
before eight years they lost each play under ryan with adelaide sevens .
here they lost only one .
this setback will hurt , but the progress is amazing .
fiji began wonderfully and let the attacks gbs out joke reflects .
it felt for the captain tom mitchell and co. on , as if one would run into driving buses . the world series winner went to 5-0 upward , when osea kolinisau in the corner rüberhechtete .
with still four minutes play time deleted to jerry tuwai still another further attack from the right corner , which it converted .
12-0 and gb hardly the ball touched .
a hevorragender tackle of mitchell stopped the mountain of man leone nakarawa a third gate to obtain , but it only stopped fiji .
in the seventh minute lete jasa veremalua in the right corner a touchdown and it stood for 0-17 for gb .
nakarawa added a new since the rekickoff and it gave still over one minute play time … in the first half .
vatemo ravouvou tore by further weak tac-sounds the gb team and stormed up to the line , in order to make a gate .
the transformation brought 29-0 up to the break .
it is , as if fiji would be was born to play the 7 while gb learns still .
so is it also .
gb accomplished basic changes to the half time and closed the fijianische gap … for whole four minutes , which for conditions of the first half time was good , until josua tuisova went through after a brillianten zwischenplay of fiji .
dan norton started an attempt for gb , made a touchdown in the left corner for 36-7 , but the play ran for a long time in favor of the south seas islanders , whose fan sang , flags swivelled and danced on the grandstand .
it was to be admired not heavily the playful approach fijis .
mata viliame set the i-tüpfelchen with a further attempt in the last seconds .
the whistle sounded , the fijis embraced themselves and gb kicked destroying struck in the lawns .
in former times on the day fiji japan in the semi-final with 20-5 had defeated and great britain pushed south africa in a scarce semi-final match from running - of great britain transformation of the difference .
kyle brown brought the boks in the first half forward , but dan norton broke through the line with an impressing foot work and obtained a gate under the posts in the second half .

helen glover and heather stanning by fight with the cancer of the coach to the rudder victory inspire
it no emotinaleres gold as with these plays will give and that wants which is called .
there from the first stroke to last , 220 hard heave , which enter history , helen glover and heather stanning found an additional meaning in its golden moment at the estacio to lagoa .
even if only the two were , which sat at the rudder , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the coach robin williams , was all-present as it to the second olympia gold in two without tax woman in consequence rowed , the first women in the history of the british sport , which put such a standard .
their dominance was absolutely , nevertheless its 39.ter unbeaten employment , which is likewise unprecedented .
which we see are two brilliante athletes , who slide over the surface with the elegance of swans , which does not reflect the kind of the triumph to entirety .
behind each gold in rowing a battalion does not put those for on willing aides , that contribute to the incremental progress , the difference constitutes and it was more helpful anybody than the coach , who did not know 30 months ago whether he would survive this day at all , when with him cancer was diagnosed .
as he said , he which riskily .
i had bladder cancer , that am operatable and did her .
if you do not do that , he spreads everywhere .
it would have been rather bad situation .
it changes a little the view .
william one made a diagnosis in december 2013 .
the trio had luck that it were treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside of which season could begin , which held the interruption a minimum , if under such circumstances at all the correct term is .
i needed money , therefore i had to be soon again better .
it was an incentive .
i was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 foot , 30 foot , 50 foot at a time , when they said that some steps would be sufficient .
thus it begins .
rowing actually is already a challenge , but it makes a still more larger .
in the immediacy of the victory went their first thoughts to william , who spent a nerve-racking morning thereby somewhat more than otherwise to talk and thus tried to process its own fears .
stanning , which was as a captain in the royal artillery regiment in use in afghanistan , said “ i was this week an emotional wreck . that is perhaps somewhat extreme , but it means so much . ”
it repeats only , how much me that means , how much i and helen and also robin worked .
were three fantastic years with helen and robin .
without robin we would not be anybody , therefore goes a massif thanks to it . he is a best coach of the world .
i could myself have wished no better person for training or a better coach .
helena glover and heather stanning lost no running in the last five years .
the pair had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 meters , as the teams from new zealand and denmark , had stanning and glover began to unlock too much in reserve .
we were very for the moment imprisoned .
helen called “ remains in the process , remains in the process ” .
it is really important not to be able to be drug along .
we had a good start and at the same time were we not out to make something great .
we wanted today no fireworks , we wanted simply a good result to obtain , go out and a running to win , which we also did .
the pair will take itself for one year a time-out , before it will make decisions over its future .
glover must appear next week on a wedding , their own with the tv-adventurer steve backshall .
now it wants to enjoy simply the moment .
i did not want to say that my last running was .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in london it took approximately six months , in order to understand that i am an olympia winner .
it was everything so again for me and i was in such a way stressed .
here it took approx. four minutes .
that feels so much better , ” said it .

steel - ray of hope for german steel industry
the crisis-shaken and energy-intensive german steel industry remains spared by additional costs in million height .
financial burdens , which threatened the industry from the green electricity promotion , are from the table .
it remains with the liberation from the renewable energy allocation with the inventory plants for so-called own electricity production in the german steel industry , said federals minister for economic affairs sigmar gabriel ( spd ) to the “ west german general newspaper ” ( waz , friday edition ) .
“ i am really glad over the fact that we could reach after two years of tough negotiations finally . ”
the european commission had therefore first planned , the steel manufacturers , which use gases from the blast furnace for generation of current for own consumption to ask to the cash .
the steel industry threatened according to the german branch federation additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
gabriel said the waz , it gives now a principle agreement with the european commission after discussions with competition commissioner margrethe vestager .
only if the generators in the steel plants are replaced , result an eeg allocation of 20 percent .
in addition , this is not raised in the steel industry .
the ig metal welcomed the agreement of germany with the european commission for own power generation .
thus one fix to the status quo of the past regulation to a large extent .
special meaning has the successful effort of gabriel for the steel industry .
“ regarding our campaign &apos; steel is future &apos; is that a first step . ”
“ further ones must follow . ”
“ also with the reform of the emission right trade climatic and occupation goals are to weigh ” , explained ig metal boss jörg hofmann in frankfurt .
the steel industry in europe suffers since the financial crisis 2008 under over-capacities and a substantial price pressure .

community , spirit , health : sing do seniors well
singing already accompanied ursel kipp their whole life : as a young girl it was in the school choir , in the teaching profession study occupied it the subject music , and today the 78-year old in a senior choir sings .
“ singing moves me - emotional and physically ” , it describes .
for a sample it feels balanced , merrily and altogether more alive , says themselves it .
completely besides she does thereby to her health and her spirit of something property .
because singing is directly from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors , says erhard hackler of the german senior league .
most seniors sing in the choir and divide with like-minded ones the joy in the music , describe hackler .
by regular gathering seniors can social contacts attach and maintain .
because frequently social and family structures at the age dissolve , a choir are then an ideal opportunity , in order to spend time with other humans .
this experience made also ursel kipp in its choir : to deny themselves “ and organize to be able and from each other learn to rely on the others - a choir is a completely special form of gathering ” .
to sing hackler can be arduous in the positive sense , means .
because seniors train a deep and controlled respiration .
who demands its lung regularly , does not come also in the everyday life so fast from the breath .
even if it concerns , the sound of the voice at the age too received , singing is an optimal hobby .
on older humans singing has often a completely special effect , says ursula lenz of the federal association of labor of the senior organizations .
in the older generations common singing had a much higher value , it belonged to the everyday life , both at school and in the spare time , explains it .
lenz observes frequently that singing or hearing songs wakes many memories with older humans , often connected with positive feelings of their youth time .
by song texts and melodies dementia-gotten sick humans particularly remember themselves for a long time past events .
when singing the head besides a special achievement is demanded , explains lenz .
to concentrate at the same time on the own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt thereby to the other singers - that is a large cognitive challenge .
straight older humans , who live alone , practice in such a way , not to only concentrate on itself .
another positive aspect is the acknowledgment , which one experiences by singing in the choir , means hackler .
an enthusiastic audience is great praise .
also the self-esteem grows by singing in the choir .
to be it shown : if i practice for a long time for something , i become better and exceed over me - this experience strengthens .
, in order to begin with singing , there are good reasons thus enough .
who wants to try a new hobby out , should not hesitate - even if he means to have little talent guesses / advises lenz .
one does not sing alone - with 50 singing humans , who hears there already , if times a tone goes beside it ?
in the search for the suitable offer have seniors different possibilities , says hackler .
if someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir , one can follow simply .
in addition many cities offer overviews of the choirs in the environment .
who would like to sing in a church choir , can contact directly the community or the church chief .
one finds many senior choirs also over the internet .
who does not have an entrance to the internet , the family , friends or neighbour can ask for assistance with the internet search .
who has desire to sing , should themselves absolutely a choir attach , guesses / advises hackler .
sing does to the soul well and has something release - is valid for each age .
cats react more sensitively than tomcats to cries of the young animals
biologists examined in hanover , calling cat babies has which effect on adults of animals .
to their surprise the miaow did not let also the males cold - however they always behaved in contrast to the females equal .
female cats can recognize the excitation degree of cat babies by the miaow of the small ones .
they react by ten percent faster to sounds of kittens , which believe themselves in large emergency , as scientists of the veterinary university and the medical university found hanover out ( mhh ) .
tomcats react also to the calls of kittens - however always same .
“ obvious are important the acoustic differences between the miaow of less and strongly excited young animals for the males either not perceptibly or not ” , said the biologist wiebke konerding of the mhh .
it is erstautorin of the study , which was published on this friday in the specialist journal “ bmc evolutionary biology ” .
in a previous investigation the researcher team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kitten cries with the urgency of their assistance neediness differ .
altogether nine adults tomcats and eight kätzinnen from the animal husbandry of the mhh were observed .
them on the one hand calls were played by small ones , which were taken for three minutes from the throw box and separated from mother and brothers and sisters .
on the other hand they were confronted with cries by more strongly excited kittens , which were additionally raised .
the researchers consider their results despite the small sample meaningful .
“ all females , even those , which had still no own new generation , reacted differentiated to the cries ” , said konerding .
they turned faster to the loudspeaker , if these calls of the very much more excited kittens played .
this ability is possibly innate or develops with sexual maturity .
“ a surprise was that the males reacted , said at all ” the biologist .
in the past scientists already several times examined the reactions of women and men with humans for baby noises .
also with it some studies that women reacted more sensitively to babies , showed completely equal whether it mothers already were or not , reported the biologist marina scheumann .

terror bombing in thailand - austrian injured - several dead
the austrian message in thailand stands with the woman in contact , said the spokesman of the state department , thomas schnöll , freitagfrüh .
it suffered cuts and was treated in the hospital , this however already again leave could .
their journey home planned it for at the beginning of septembers .
whether by the further explosions on the holiday-maker island phuket are affected as well as in the southern cities surat thani , catch nga , trang and chumphon likewise austrian citizens , is for the time being still unclear .
the state department is located in this connection in constant contact with the local authorities , thus to schnöll .
in approximately 200 kilometers south the capital bangkok the convenient hua had exploded first on thursday evening in a going out quarter of two bombs .
according to police one thailänderin were killed and about 20 humans were injured , among them the austrian , three germans , three dutchmen and three italians .
friday-early then again two explosive devices went highly , according to the authorities further humans were killed .
also of phuket in the early a bomb explosion was announced .
with the explosion in the proximity with holiday-makers bath beach patong liked after police sources a cab driver were injured .
in surat thani at the southeast coast of the country exploded then a further bomb , which killed an urban employee .
the explosive device went according to the authorities in a flower bed before the district of the coastal police into air .
finally still explosions in catch nga and trang at the southwest coast as well as in chumphon at the southeast coast demanded several injured ones .
one proceeds from a connection with the explosions in hua , it was said .
“ the bomb assassination attempts carry the same handwriting ” , said army general danai kritmethavee friday-early before journalists .
“ we assume it concerns a coordinated attack . ”
it is too early , in order to express itself to possible motives - probably concern it however the acts of muslim rebels .
also thai media wanted to recognize a sample , which is typical for the bomb assassination attempts of muslim separatists in the south of the country with the attacks .
the thai police however explained , the assassination attempts would not stand in connection with the islamist rebellion movement or with the international terrorism .
“ that is limited only local sabotage , to limited areas and provinces ” , said themselves a spokesman in bangkok .
one assumes rather the bombs were put by opponents of the dominant military junta .
the authorities would have received secretofficial referring to forthcoming attacks in the south of the country in the past days - however they had not been informed about the exact time and the places .
still is unclear , which puts group behind the attacks .
the police instructed its officials generally speaking country , security approximately around important government buildings as well as airports , stations , tourist attractions , to strengthen restaurants and nightclub districts .
in thailand there are smaller bomb attacks again and again , but are usually not directed it not against tourists .
in hua lies a palace , which was used over years by of thailand king bhumibol adulyadej .
after the present bomb explosions the austrian state department on its homepage recommends to absolutely carry out for the instructions of the thai security authorities consequence .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) be valid for the provinces narathiwat , yala , pattani and songhkla as well as preah vihear and environment .
after arguments between safety forces and muslim population parts before not necessary travels into these provinces one advises against .
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) be valid for the rest of the country .
the attacks on thursday and friday were made few days after a disputed referendum by a condition prepared by the military junta .
this grants large influence to the military also in the coming years .
junta boss and prime minister prayut chan o cha said , the bombs had been an attempt to donate chaos during itself the country toward stability , an improvement of the economic situation and the tourism move .
the militärunta , which had seized 2014 after a phase of bloody riots power , grants itself the kingdom again to stability and order to have led .
however also the military did not succeed in getting for years the rebellion of muslim rebels smoldering in the extreme south of the country into the grasp .
in the conflict already more than 6500 humans were killed .
scarcely one year ago besides in bangkok with an attack at a popular hindu shrine 20 humans had been killed - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloodiest attack of the recent history of the country .
the right “ identitäre movement ” is in its sights the federal office for protection of the constitution guessed / advised .
after several offices of a federal state also the verfassungsschützer in the federation placed the group under observation .
“ we see reference points for efforts with the &apos; identitären movement &apos; against the liberal democratic constitutional structure ” , said protection of the constitution boss of hans-georg maaßen of the german press agency in berlin .
thus immigrants of islamic faith are defamed or from the near east in extremist way .
therefore we observe the movement now also .
the “ identitäre movement ” is a grouping with french roots , which is active since 2012 also in germany .
it turns against “ multikulti illusion ” , “ uncontrolled mass immigration ” and the “ loss of the own identity by foreign infiltration ” .
verfassungsschützer in nine federal states - bremen , bavaria , hessen , berlin , baden-wuerttemberg , north-rhine / westphalia , lower saxony , saxony and thuringia - observe the “ identitären ” already .
maaßen said , its authority with the decision with the offices of a federal state had closely come to an agreement .
“ groups like the &apos; identitäre movement &apos; try to fetch their target audience where it stands , said ” the protection of the constitution boss .
extremists generally try to address it with youth-fair language often with trendy music .
islamists would do that just like right-wing extremists .
that is not fussy advertisement for the own thing .
propaganda is to address the people emotional .
young people are there in special way susceptible .
that is dangerous .
it had last given reports from several federal states over contacts of the “ identitären ” to afd politicians .
maaßen said , in addition he did not have realizations .
for the protection of the constitution possible contacts of this kind are only relevant starting from a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the afd - by certain people , who are extremist , change their objective and become so extremist .
decisive it is thus whether such people have steering influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
with view of the clear increase of right-motivated criminal offences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee accommodation maaßen , it said in this context not yet again to right terrorism would speak .
but we stated in the past years that there can be rechtsterroristische structures .
there was the group &apos; old school society &apos; or the freitaler group .
it can quite be that further rechtsterroristische groupings or kleinstgruppen form , which plan attacks against asylum-seekers , against refugee homes or attacks from other right-extremist motives .
a germany-wide or european-wide control of right terrorism is however not recognizable .
the past groups developed on the regional level or in social nets .
procured maaßen expressed itself over the fact that many encroachments went on the account from humans , who had not stepped before in the right scene into feature .
that is the causing concern .
many the suspects with attacks on asylum accommodation are before not as criminal ones , politically motivated offenders or supporters of the right scene do not admit been .
“ many people committed thus criminal offences , which did not have nothing at all before with right-wing extremists at the hat , who were perhaps politically indifferent or for example cdu , spd or link to have selected , which tendency-makes itself then however by right-extremist radicalized ” .
rio 2016 : robel kiros habte becomes the internet hit
always the olympians or world records do not determine the headlines with the olympic games .
that points the courageous appearance of robel kiros habte with the summer games to rio de janeiro .
in the aquatics center swam the easily overweight float from ethiopia so slowly that it was not to be seen occasionally no more in the tv-pictures .
it disappeared simply - no matter how was far the cutout selected .
in the social networks habte became following the viral internet hit .
the 24-year old with a residue of 48 seconds its advance actually terminates and occupied the 59 . place of 59 starters .
it was however rather its not straight sporty figure , which drew the attention of the international media on itself .
why does the 24-year old at the olympic games participate nevertheless ?
the ethiopian got a right of kind of separating from the international swimming federation .
this is distributed , in order to make a swimming in underrepresented countries more well-known .
since in Äthopien most sportsmen run , habte wanted to make just something else .
preparation is everything : robel kiros habte makes itself finished for large running .
the first nicknames made the round fast .
some media called it “ robel the whale ” .
following a “ prosperity belly ” the english tabloid made itself “ the sun ” with “ dad bod ” over it hilariously .
his time , it fastened only with one minute and nearly five seconds over the 100 meters freestyle , played there no role .
comparisons with “ eric the eel ” were drawn likewise .
with the olympic games 2000 in sydney the run of eric moussambani provided for medial attention .
the appearance of the float from equatorial guinea was unforgettable , when it had to begin in an advance over 100 meters freestyle alone .
frenetically moussambani was encouraged at that time .
the at that time 22-year old learned to swim only eight months before olympia and before the match never a so long distance had completed .

the bus got to the right off the road and slipped into a ditch , as a spokeswoman of the police aurich / wittmund reported .

the fire-brigade freed the passengers .

the fees per cubic meter waste water amount to starting from 1 october 2016 for the range of the sewage system neudorf / reuth / welschenkahl 3.44 instead of so far 2.10 euros ; for zultenberg / lindenberg / lopp 3.36 euros ( so far 2.26 euros ) and for azendorf 3.64 euros ( so far 2.18 euros ) .
with the plant in azendorf the waste water fee will at the latest again increase if appropriate improvement measures become necessary .
after a rough calculation the waste water price in azendorf about 4.37 euros per cubic meter will then be .
how mayor bernd steinhäuser ( csu ) reported , with the approval of the household by the district administration office kulmbach was stated that for these sewage systems unterdeckungen accumulate .
the market kasendorf is obligated due to legal bases to operate the plants cost-hitting a corner .
starting from 1 october 2016 the citizens as well as the trade and industrial companies from welschenkahl , new village , reuth , azendorf , lopp , lindenberg and zultenberg more deeply into the purse will have to reach .
the increases in charges lie between 48 and 67 percent .
as administrative leader pointed herbert schmidt to the committee out , a new calculation of the fees was necessary for the sewage systems of the market community .
in the period of october 2016 until september 2020 also over and / or unterdeckungen from the preceding calculation period is to be adjusted .
schmidt justified the serious increases in charges with the fact that it acts with all three sewage systems around relatively small facilities with a very small waste water accumulation , which lies between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year .
thus due to the small distribution basis for example expenditures for necessary repairs would affect themselves several thousand euros seriously .
besides the waste water arising is easily declining in all three plants .
further in the past calculation period with all three plants not least due to their age redevelopment and repair expenditures to a substantial extent resulted .
the plant in azendorf is almost 30 years old , the plants for welschenkahl , new village and reuth as well as zultenberg , lindenberg and lopp nearly 20 years .
schmidt referred to the fact that in the sewage system azendorf the mechanical ventilating system had to be exchanged due to a damage .
in the pumping plant welschenkahl had to be overhauled those almost 20 years old conveyor plants by reason on and with the pond purification plant lopp had after almost 20 years enterprise the first sludge pond excavated , the sewage sludge to be disposed of and an additional ventilation possibility inserted , in order to be able to keep the water-legal defaults also in the future .
schmidt : “ to these extraordinary expenditures the updated care and maintenance costs came to consider those accordingly in the new calculation period are . ”
the same is valid for cost of electricity , to which with the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 still clearly under the current level were .
it made stone houses clear that with the small waste water accumulation in the three plants the expenditures for the enterprise and maintenance pierce “ fully ” .
, supplemental schmidt remained exempted , the market community from large maintenance costs with the sewage systems in the past 20 years .
the situation for the plants mentioned will in the long term remain further precarious in opinion of stone houses , particularly since one will not extend the supply area of the waste water special purpose association friesenbachtal by these plants can , because it concerns in deficit facilities .

snapchat of “ anime ” - effect as asian caricature criticizes
snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired , but some observers say that it is insensitive in relation to races .
with its filter tools it makes snapchat approximately 150 million for daily users possible to change and play with identities in so a way the reality , which already borders on the absurd .
they can transform into a pineapple , a dog or a figure , which could be from a roy lichtenstein &apos;s paintings .
the filters are blunt , characteristic-rotating tools , which produce more than 30 million improved selfies per day .
all lapses arrive at the public .
snapchat filters pulled in the past criticism on itself , in which they were accused of the fact that the app promotes blackface or as ideal of beauty would publicise white skin .
when it suggested this week to some users a filter , which gave slot eyes , wrong teeth and aufgedunsene cheeks them , it some critics called a racist caricature of asians - “ yellow face ” .
they asked themselves whether these repetitive controversies referred to a larger problem that the enterprise with diversity has .
the news and the indignation were spread on wednesday far , with reports of the verge and motherboard , one day after snapchat communicated that it would have deactivated the feature .
the enterprise offered an apology : the filter was meant as homage of anime characters and not as caricature from asians .
but outsider , the racing sis mash experienced , reminded the filter of injuring plates .
others leaned the anime comparison decided off .
in an email wrote grace sparapani , an korean-american art student , whose tweet was far spread over the photos that the filter was said unpleasant “ injuring and gentle . ”
it added that “ it was difficult with the confrontation of a very disgusting asian caricature and filter effects to argue .
it shows that the filter is not gelbgesichtig , but that the yellow face was pulled in the devaluing extreme .
snapchat is not the only enterprise , which crosses this cultural trip wire .
the american culture seems to be complicated in an endless diversity and integration fight , from conference rooms to hollywood and the devices , which we all hold in the hand .
and snapchats large audience of young people - which are various in things race than their older opponents - could assume that rather to expect sensitivity .
if one of snapchats filters produces a picture that it is insulting for a user “ like that it is many more difficult that such things remain unnoticed , than it was in former times the case ” said 25-year old katie zhu in an interview on thursday .
on thursday zhu , which as a product manager and engineer for medium works , decided to delete their snapchat account requested others to do the same .
in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview it said that she believed that race-referred controversies reflect a lack of diversity with the attitude practices with snapchat .
zhu criticized to a large extent white , only male leadership and terminated its essay with a hashtag : # deletesnapchat .
“ either it does not have a various representation of humans with other skin colors in her staff , so that they can make such decisions , ” said the chinesich american zhu , “ or it has humans with other skin colors , to say which work there , but not in positions , in those they are itself or probably-feel , around which against it . ”
others divide its opinion , a complaint , the snapchat left to a large extent unanswered .
the enterprise publishes no numbers for the diversity of its staff and refers to its status as private enterprise .
on thursday it rejected snapchat to discuss the cultural background of its employees but loud a spokesman the enterprise adjusted recently a staff responsible person , who concentrates on underrepresented subpopulations and on internal integration efforts .
zhu said for its part the fact that she will leave her snapchat account closed and added , “ i asked myself , whether they need more user like us , in order to be able to say that is not o.k. ”
military guidance falsifies isis geheimdienstinformationen , determines committee of the congress
military personnel of the united states cent ral command would locally have permitted , announced changed intelligence information to draw over a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called islamic state in iraq and in syria than it the actual conditions a committee of inquiry of the congress in a report on thursday .
the provisional report , provided by a task force of the republican members of the streitkräftekommitees , geheimdienstkommitees and the wehrbudgetkommites , reports of large discontent under cent ral command secret service analysts , which reported , how superiors changed their estimates to the american efforts in the fight against the islamic state .
the cent ral the command , briefly cencom , is military headquarters in tampa , florida , which steers the american military operations in the near east and central asia .
“ intelligence information , which of high-ranking centcom commanders were typically nodded through , drew regularly a more positive picture of the american efforts against the terrorism as it the actual conditions would locally have permitted and was constantly more positive than analyses of other intelligence services ” , quoted a newspaper article the report .
“ which happened , is with the centcom unacceptable - our soldiers suffer , if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders ” , determined ken calvert , republican member of the house of representatives .
the guidance errors in the centcom reach up to the highest point of the organization .
the ten-page report shows details steady problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the american efforts in the training of the iraqi armed forces .
although it does not supply direct pointing out that tops of the government among obama &apos;s gave instructions to change the reports shows it , like analysts the pressure of their vorgesetzen suspended saw itself , a more optimistic picture of the threat of the islamic state , also well-known than isis or isil to draw .
“ during the first half-year 2015 many cent ral commands press releases , statements and statements before the congress were clearly more positively than it the facts correspond ” determined the report .
for example a centcom of members announced publicly that a military recapture mossuls could already begin in april or may 2015 .
mossul , second largest city iraq , remains further under control of the islamic state .
“ after months of investigations , so much is clear . ” mike pompeo , republican congressional representatives from kansas , in a statement said .
from the center of the year 2014 up to the center of the year 2015 the points of the cent ral command changed the intelligence reports , in order to play the danger down by isis in iraq .
the republicans brought the task force into being , after them it was passed on that analysts worryd themselves regarding the manipulation from reports to the islamic state .
on thursday published report will be completed still by more detailed realizations during the investigations to be continued .
further investigations of the centcom of reports are additional by the general inspector of the ministry of defense under way .
democratic members of the nachrichtendienstekomittees published their own realizations , which agreed with some of the conclusions of the republican task force on thursday .
“ in the years 2014 and 2015 the centcom created an excessively limited process for the production from intelligence estimates to isil and the iraqi security agencies ” , announced the höchstrangige democrat in the committee , member in the house of representatives adam b. schiff , in a statement .
this process , so mr. schiff , “ delayed the publication of intelligence reports ” , damaged the moral under analysts and “ excessively gave little area for deviating opinions . ”
but mr. schiff and the democrats indicated , no referring to an intervention of the white house for the centcom analysts regarding “ determined political opinion ” have found .
the provisional results of the investigations of the congress were published on tuesday by “ the daily beast ” .
in past august new york times von ermittlungen reported the pentagon , who were accepted after complaints by centcom analyst by the general inspector .
as per cmdr. patrick evans , a press spokesman the pentagon , indicated in a statement that the ministry of defense would not commentate reports of the congress , while the investigations of the general inspector were still under way .
but it also indicated that “ experts have sometimes quite diverging opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the ministry of defense welcome a controversy discussion of these important topics of the national defense . ”
the investigations have reactions over the question of a successful air campaign under american leadership in iraq and syria outside ( a statement , which is made in the meantime by an increasing number of members of the ministry of defense ) .
the accusations of the past year raised however the question , to what extent president obama can rely on the cent ral the command for honest estimates of the military operations in iraq , afghanistan , libya and other crisis zones .
the criticism regarding the secret information about the islamic state remind of disputes from more than ten years ago , than a centcom analyst , gregory hooker wrote , a document over it , like the government at that time under george w. bush against the recommendations of many analysts only a small occupation troop in iraq planned and little time on it distorted , to make itself over the consequences of the invasion from 2003 thoughts to .
mr. hooker played also a key role with the rebellion against the present reporting over the islamic state .
last year the team places around mr. hooker according to government agencies firmly that against the statements the government air strikes would not have significant effects against the refineries thought of the islamic state on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since these provisional refineries would have taken in enterprise , in order to sell oil on the black market .
this realization was not published however , reported the times in september .
centcoms of commanders at that time , gene . lloyd j. austin iii , was criticized by members of the legislation because of its excessively positive estimate of the war situation with a hearing before the senate .
general austin went in april into the retirement and became with the cent ral command by gene . joseph l. votel replaces .

great britain and the united states will meet one another on saturday in the last play of the first round .
both crews qualified themselves for the quarter final , the play will already decide , which of the two will attain first and the second place in each case within their group from six teams .
the erstplatzierte will go to the strong dutchwomen somewhat longer out of the way , who would start the other group .
however the play on saturday to go out likes , the americans by their success story a surprising eddy released , four years after it with past london games on the last of 12 places landed .
bam was part of this team .
it buildup in blue bell , pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a hockey stick in hands ( its two older sisters played the sport at the drexel university ) , with 16 years became them national player of the usa , the youngest in the history of the team .
it missed the olympiad in the year 2008 , since she could not itself qualify for the cadre .
then the year 2012 came , in which for it and its team everything went wrong .
in the following year craig parnham , an englishman , became coach of the national team and thus began himself the things to the better to turn .
“ a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change ” , said bam .
we did not have the work load in london , which we have now .
we could to pull around the rudder completely .
on thursday evening bam opened the gate round dance in the first half of the play with a backhand stroke from close range .
india had gone without victory in the tournament into the play , but the team appeared surprisingly toughly and held the score from 1-0 into the third quarter , until bam took the play into its hands .
it full-led a sprint with the flat ball across the left flank , pulled then into the center and lifted the ball into the gate around the americans 2-0 a guidance to provide .
melissa gonzalez made the final gate in the center of the last quarter .
the shutout was first of the whole tournament for the goal keeper of the usa , jackie briggs , who had in each case to book so far a gate in everyone of the previous plays .
it has a run .
exactly the same as bam .
“ we are in a good position ” said parnham , but will depend as well on the result of the next play on saturday .
in the midst of rise up the olympic games , the zen of the trampolins
where always you are also , as late it is also , there is the olympic games .
the events in rio de janeiro feel steadily and inevitably , a racing relay race between competition and props .
it is , as if the olympic torch would be a burning staff , that is handed of crossbow contactors to the float to the gymnast to the triathlete .
they cannot switch the television on , read a newspaper or listen with the discussion of your neighbour in the queue in the coffeshop , without hearing over simone biles , katie ledecky or the controversy between michael phelps and chad le clos .
and then it gives still logan dooley .
dooley , which is for the first time with the olympic games thereby and a woman swarm with dimples , could have been quite under this well-known names , which are sent to the prime time , developed by sponsors and wohlfühl tv advertisement , if he were a float , a gymnast or even a fencer .
but dooley , 28 , from lake forest , california , fights in the olympic trampolinturnen for gold .
the olympic flame does not light up each equal event .
of the center , partly in the shade continue to be the kinds of sport , which are not generally appreciative : airgun-shoot , sheet shooting , bath min tone , taekwondo .
we will always have and may the breaststroke swimming it for a long time prevail .
but if i modest-prove arguments for my certain favourite to make were allowed , then you let me steer the attention on the discrete charm of the trampolins .
although the trampolinspringen is already since 2000 an olympic event , when it had its debut in sydney , it the last 16 years so meagerly noticed that those , i had asked many , did not know that it is at all an olympia kind of sport .
that could be also regional ignorance .
although the usa to the match sent athletes , it won never a medal in the trampolinspringen and had to 2012 an athlete , which created it up to the final round .
the chinese and the russians bend to divide the prices for the men and the chinese and the canadians for the women .
dong dong from china and rosie maclennan from canada will defend this year their gold medal from london .
the trampolinspringen has a certain outsider charm , partly because it for the unexplained ear more suitably for a clown school than for the olympic games sounds .
here i should admit that i am not an expert , but only a ground-based enthusiast .
it has humoristic potential - kartoonhafte trembling of its to never end wanting impact - in addition , the grace of doing gymnastics and dipping , the two kinds of sport , which it essentially unites .
the word “ trampolin ” comes from the spanish el trampolin , which means so much like “ springboard . ”
rising winners jump on a gigantic trampolin , shoot nearly up to 30 foot into air and must a row at falling movements ( tricks , pikes and somersaults ) , before they land on the feet .
they are evaluated according to official olympia program after execution , degree of difficulty and “ flying time ” .
zweiundreißig athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will begin against each other in rio .
the in accordance with-loneliest olympic vector is straightforward .
medal-hoping must go in their striving for gold further , faster , upward and over it , sometimes up to the goal , sometimes back and forth , upward and downward on the playground .
they hunt not only the target line or the output wall , but in the television transmission also a further scornful goal : those the world or the olympia record .
purposeful striving is noble , admirable , even fanatical - and it is enough , in order to agitate even a spectator to tears .
but it is also what i feel when watching these plays as something fatiguing .
of it the trampolin offers a breathing space .
the vector of the trampolinspringers is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
it or it reflects , apparently weightlessly like an astronaut , goes upward , then downward , then easy again upward .
a competition , naturally not without difficulty , prevails also here but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal , no curving to the distance , only the dreamy , elegant abolition of time and gravity .
it is like that zen like the competition with the olympic games to only be can .
the qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on friday afternoon , in the streaming around 13.00 eastern time ; those of the men on saturday , likewise around 13.00 .
nbc will radiate the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days starting from 14.00 .
in the midst of the olympia mania they promise a calm , nice moment , one , which will probably ignore generally tumult .
if the consciousness increase can be achieved only by gaping and the objektifizierung of male athletes - how the male us-gymnasts suggested it according to the the wall street journal recently - then its , new fan club struggling for air expects mr. dooley .
“ a generation protests ” in ethiopia , long an allying of the usa
violent protests in ethiopia
demonstrators , who demand political changes in ethiopia , encountered violent resistance of the government .
witnesses state that tens of protesting was killed during the collisions with the police with shootings .
is to be broken down ethiopia about ?
in the last ten years it was one of the sturdiest countries of africa , a solid allying of the west with a fast growing economy .
but in the last months protests shook the country against the government and expanded into more and more areas .
last week stormed thousands of people on the roads and required fundamental political changes .
the answer the government was merciless according to human rights organizations .
witnesses indicated that policemen shot and killed at tens of unarmed demonstrators .
in the circulation videos present over the protests , which are supposed from the latter or at the beginning of this year , show up like security personnel young people with sticks strike , while these were forced to make a handstand against a wall .
the boss of the un agency for human rights requires now a detailed investigation .
“ it was always difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even still more difficult , ” said rashid abdi , the project manager the horn of africa that internationally crisis group , a research group .
ethiopia is to nigeria the most densely populated country of africa and its stability becomes estimated from the west .
american militär-und of secret services co-operates closely with the ethiopians , in order to fight dangers of terrorism beyond the region , in particular in somalia . only few countries in africa , if at all , receive so much western assistance .
of ethiopia economy expanded in the considerable speed .
its infrastructure improved drastically - it gives a new commuter course in the capital to addis abeba .
the roads are usually calmly , safe and clean .
even if ethiopia everything else were as a model for democracy - human rights organizations stated sequentially the suppression by the government - the opposition in the country became reduced , whereby dissidents were effectively hushed .
many were sent , killed into the exile or into the prison or floated into the widths of the desert .
but that could change .
“ if you people suppress and this no other options have except to protest , break it off , ” said seyoum teshome , a lecturer in central ethiopia .
the entire youth protests .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints , which take everything off of the use of land up to the stranglehold regarding power of the governing coalition .
after an extensively criticized choice the governing party and control its allied ones the last seat of the opposition received last year and now 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time the tensions rise along the border to eritrea ; a fight for this jagged , disputed line demanded hundreds of lives in june .
analysts fear that separatists like the oromo liberation front or the national liberation front of the ogaden , which was more or less defeated in the last years , which could turbulences use and again arm themselves .
several factors explain , why feelings of the embitterment explode after years before itself of the hinköchelns under the surface now .
first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in the last years a great many ethiopians in the position were to communicate by means of the social media since cheaper smartphones became ever more frequent and improved the internet services .
even if the government closes the entrance to facebook and twitter , which does it in regular intervals , particularly with protests , many people can communicate still over internet proxies , which hide , where they are .
several young ethiopians indicated that they met in such a way to protests .
the second factor is the fact that it more solidarity between the oromos and amharas which , gives two largest ethnicities in ethiopia .
the oromos and amharas are not natural enemies .
since Äonen prospered the amharas , which come from Äthopiens predominantly christian highlands , in which politics and economy , while they exploited the oromos , from which many muslims are and live in flat country areas .
in addition , changes .
“ we are about to coordinate under a screen ” said mulatu gemechu , a leader of the oromos .
the largest protests took place in areas of the amhara and oromos .
many amharas and oromos have the feeling that ethiopia unfair-proves by members of the ethnic group of the tigray is dominated , those approximately 6 percent of the population to constitute and in the military , in the secret services , in the trade and the policy dominantly are .
the third reason for the riots is the death of meles zenawi .
mr. meles , a former rebel leader , was 2012 17 years long up to its death at a not publicly made illness in the year of ethiopia prime minister .
it was viewed as a tactical genius , a man , who could think around corners .
to analysts say that it was particularly experienced to notice early signs of discontent and use particular agents , in order opponents to work on and it innocuous make .
“ it is missing to the present regime at this basic fate , ” said mr. abdi , a conflict analyst .
of ethiopia of new prime ministers , hailemariam desalegn , for relatively obscure reasons was selected , in order to take the position of mr. meles .
differently than mr. meles , who came from the tigray region of north ethiopia , mr. hailemariam comes from the south .
analysts say that it does not enjoy the confidence from the tigray controlled security agencies .
many fear that the result more bloodshed will be .
the last mark that ethiopia experienced such a riot was 2005 , after thousands protested against elections , which bungled according to information of analysts apparently from the government and were afterwards stolen .
during the raids following on it many protesting were killed , even if than in the last months were less and this time of the riots passed relatively fast .
development experts praised of ethiopia leader for their visionary infrastructure planning , like the new commuter course , as well as for its measurable progress with the fight against poverty .
but obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal disfavor of the ethiopian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
protesting in gondar , a amharischen city , of tigray led business attacked last month and the hate opposite the tigray become ever more usual in the social media .
analysts say that the protests bring the usa and other western allied one into their own position .
the american government used ethiopia as basis for dronenflüge over the neighbouring somalia , even if it communicated recently that she closed this basis .
while the west wants to support clearly the democracy , it does not want that its allying in an already volatile area breaks down .
“ this , ” said mr. abdi , “ is a very thin tightrope walk . ”
donald trump explains his statement obama has isis to “ sarcasm ” was created
donald j. trump tried to scatter the last controversy , which surrounds its campaign friday , by indicating that his several times repeated statement , president obama and hillary clinton would be the “ founders ” of the terrorist group islamic state , had been not seriously meant .
this clarification raised new questions to the able to communicatenesses of the presidential candidate of the republicans whether it was able clearly and understandably with the american public to communicate .
also its fellow combatants bring themselves , endeavor it during an eventful phase in protection to take to have to explain into the peculiar position , statements which he could not at all have meant .
after it had made the suggestion during an election campaign event at wednesday evening , mr rowed . trump regarding the statement on thursday back and insisted in interviews on the fact that it did not intend really to suggest , the president and mrs. isis would have created clinton .
but in a earlymorning tweet on friday mr said . trump , it is simply sarcastically .
the tweet was the contrast to the previous day , at those mr. trump in a set of interviews said , he meant the accusation perfectly seriously .
as the conservative radio moderator hugh hewitt mr. trump to help wanted to weaken the statement somewhat as it of the fact reminded that mr. obama isis to destroy wants to know , wanted the republican presidential candidate nothing of it .
the last storm of the criticism sizzles on mr. trump down , during he tried the focus of his campaign to steer because of falling poll ratings on the economic situation .
mr. trump and mrs. speeches held clinton to the economic situation in michigan this week .
friday mr tried . to turn trump again to this topic back .
over twitter announcing it warned itself that mrs. clintons &apos;s proposals to higher taxes would lead and that he their speech boring had found .
mr. trump already stated sarcasm to his defense .
at the end of july drew it strong criticism on itself , when he meant , the russians should mrs. clintons &apos;s enamels chop , however he explained later “ natural meant i the sarcastic ” .
this method permits it to mr. to shift and then as required back row trump the linguistic borders in the policy .
“ i think , it am one of its methods to be tested , as certain messages are taken up by its fans , how they arrive , and then “ to get straight if necessary ” depending upon that , as the reaction fails . ” said ruth sherman , a kommunikationsexpertin , which observes the language of both candidates .
in addition , i believe , he am more smartly enough around its statements enough to be held vaguely , so that they can be interpreted in different way .
instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections , mr has . trump a still more corroding tone accepted , since its poll ratings continued to decrease .
a new survey of nbc / wall street journal / marist , which was published on friday , showed a guidance with large lead in the federal states north carolina , virginia , colorado and a neck-and-neck race in florida .
during mr. generally tried not to have to apologize for its provocative expressions it accuses its critics of trump frequently to distort its statements or to understand its humor wrongly .
but while it is located strengthened in the focus of the attention in the last months of its presidency campaign , mr have . trumps &apos;s jokes its loyal fellow combatants into the incommodious situation brought , to it stand to have , independently of as provocatively its statements may also be .
rudolph w. giuliani , former mayor of new york and of trumps most prominent advocates , gave himself to defend large trouble the candidate today in an cnn interview from thursday to .
“ i believe , what he says is legitimate , political comments ” said mr. giuliani thus it to the correctness of mr. trumps &apos;s statements it was asked whether mr. obama and mrs. clinton the islamic state would have created .
it is in this sense truely that before obama isis a nearly unknown , small organization was , he called her backbenchers , perfectly wrongly and therefore happened it , because it withdrew the troops from iraq .
most mainstream republicans try to argue that the government among obama , in the mrs. clinton as a foreign minister served , it isis permitted , to spread as it omitted bringing the situation in the near east aggressively under control .
before the election campaign events in pennsylvania on friday mr set . trump its attacks on the media away and accused to them to harp on on each of its words and be partial against him .
he did not lampoon the “ poor , deplorable ” television experts , who try him to understand and said , “ you can it ! ” .
some of the democrats scoffed at mr. trumps &apos;s apology as only a further proof that it is unsuitable for the presidential office .
once over the price displaced by the market , café returns to greenpoint
verb cafe was a shabby café in william castle , in which one could pay only bar , whom no wi-fi had , for it however 15 years to long good coffee served .
naturally by the prices from its bedford avenue &apos;s shop front was displaced .
the business soap cherie , which replaced verb in the summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cupcakes .
native mourned for it as last loss in gentrifizierenden themselves city .
the artist molly crabapple wrote on twitter , “ i white , new york is change , but i cannot believe yet that cbgb is dead , chelsea hotel now exceptionally and verb a soap business . ”
but if new york is change , then it is also reinvention .
a revived verb cafe opened last november in greenpoint , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has wi-fi and accepts credit cards , but has still some the same employees and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is also still good .
the new owner the verb is cisco rodriguez , an employee of many years of the old café , who owner and managing director of the new café is .
he began to work 2001 at verb and remained there up to the end .
when a customer offered to it to make funds available for a new branch office it was excited to do it said it .
rodriguez , 36 , maintained much .
verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model .
it uses even the same lamps from the old verb .
but rodriguez said that he wanted to also experiment .
it introduced new ingredients .
on the menu sandwiches with bacon and cheese stand and it give never run gene such as capers and sauted bulbs .
there are brown rice dishes .
the café serves no more beer , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months rodriguez said that he had noticed a constant river at old regular customers .
“ many old customers were displaced likewise by prices from william castle , ” said it .
on one sunday rebecca oliveira such a customer was recent .
olive ira , 34 , lived in former times in william castle and visited the verb regularly .
even after it had pulled after greenpoint , she would take on the way .
after the verb had closed , it gave one while up the coffee , said it .
“ me it became clear that it was at the coffee and because of the culture in the verb , which pleased me ” said it .
now she drinks again coffee , even if she ordered a blended chai tea , who is a further new additive on this day in place of its usual iced coffees .
tom rosenthal is since the beginning the verb in the year 2003 a further customer of many years and faithful .
it went there before the work and inevitably always ordered the same .
“ i came quarters to seven , each day , like swiss a watch and her prepare my everything bagel with butter , ” said he .
photo rodriguez said , it wanted to experiment and to take up new ingredients to the menu .
nowadays rosenthal gets still its usual order , sometimes but he alternates its everything bagel with bacon , egg and cheese .
rodriguez said that he did not preserve resentment over the fact that the soap business took the old business area .
the owners of the soap cherie actually offered to manufacture a special soap for verb with the kaltgebrühten coffee of the café as ingredient .
“ i think , we still with its offer will deal , ” said rodriguez .
and the traditional , polish inhabitants greenpoints likewise accepted the café .
a new customer translated the menu into the polish and said rodriguez that he intends to issue it soon so that its new neighbours feel welcome .
the location has also further advantages .
a local juice restaurant would like to fill and sell the kaltgebrühten coffee in bottles .
there is an opportunity that the café expands on a neighbouring building .
for many customers a new verb is sufficient , in order to get their old favorites .
joseph witt was regular customer and said that he was destroyed at the ground , when the café closed .
when the new café opened , whitt said that entering the restaurant and ordering felt new coffee like a home coming .
“ i had to smell that , ” said he .
the depressing meal of the economic crisis in “ a plentiful meal ”
in march 1933 , shortly after his ascent to the president , franklin delano roosevelt took his lunch in the oval office .
as a gourmet president roosevelt had a weakness for refined delicacies of fifth avenue such as pâte de foie grass and maryland water turtle soup .
its menu on this day was somewhat more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , mashed potatoes and as dessert a plum pudding .
“ it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , ” said jane ziegelman .
her husband andrew coe added , “ it was also a message to the americans , like her to eat should . ”
the married couple lives in brooklyn heights and is both food historians .
coes last book “ chop suey ” acted of the chinese kitchen in the usa , while “ about the life in a house to the lower east side from the food perspective tells ziegelman in its book 97 orchard ” .
you newest co-operation , “ a decent meal ” , which will appear on tuesday in harper verlag , illustrate the history of the american kitchen during great depression .
they showed culinary solidarity , when them sand-yielded themselves with a reporter in the eisenberg &apos;s shop with dinner meet , a small , straightforward lunch in the flatiron district , which is already since the stock market crash 1929 in the business .
ziegelman , 54 , cream cheese-sand-yielded with olive bits , during coe , turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ordered 57 ass .
when the reporter ordered chopping roasts , this found the pair suitable for a discussion over the meal in the era of great depression .
“ rich food was much likes ” , said ziegelman .
there was peanut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap one , which stretches the ingredient .
introduce yourselves to eat so many peanuts that they serve them as dinners .
coe grinned .
“ it must have put in the stomach such as lead , ” said it .
in the years before great depression the table in an american household , particularly in rural areas , was a universe you can eat buffet .
crews of women cooked for male agricultural labourers and it freshly baked pie for breakfast , for the lunch and dinners were served .
were the americans , who sent europeans on during the first world war food being hungry . “ a square meal ” notes the ways , with which the country dealt with it , no more the paradise to be .
“ it was a time , in which meal for the americans became a central , strained topic ” , begündete coe , why it and its wife over it to write wanted .
the new budget diet was just as strained : mysterious meals such as bread and casseroles became staple food , the casserole as “ wonderful kind of recycling leftovers ” marked ziegelman , since cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a kremigen sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper drying fruit .
meat , which was for many years the center of the american kitchen , became a rarely served luxury .
strange mixtures were tried out , since a calorie-rich and feedful satisfaction had priority before taste or even healthy understanding of kitchen .
during its search for the book , which covers also recipes , a court prepared ziegelman baked bulbs with peanut butter from this epoch .
“ it was not a popular additive at the mittagstsich , ” says coe .
brick man continues to implement : “ it was surreally . ”
peanut butter and baked bulbs do not fit to each other .
it was typical for many of the housekeeping recipes .
like never before or since then , household businesspeople - under it louise stanley , leiterin federal office of the of home economics between 1923 to 1943 - propelled the eating habits of the country so .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged to become women “ budgetary policy gutters ” to become fair and the challenge to transform pampe like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals .
“ a square meal ” is a celebration of the historical delicacies .
in particular tastily the reports are being hungry over the answer of the government to those citizens , like president herbert hoovers letting me cake meal leaving .
while it praised publicly simple iowa farmhouse kitchen of its kitchen , he fed like the worth millions man of world , whom he became .
“ he liked continental kitchen such as fish with cucumber sauce , ” said coe .
he ate in a nearly gilded dining-room and wore a tuxedo .
it was wonderful out of touch with reality .
perhaps president roosevelt would have committed the same error , if not his mrs. eleanor had requested him to set with his stomach an example .
as in the book descriptive hiring a lady housekeeper with no interest in flavors led by mrs. roosevelt to it that the white house brought the most boring meal out in washington , but also one at the most hopeless prepared one . ”
many of the kinds from the era of great depression of dealing with meal it was rejected , as soon as the country came the legs .
the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , said ziegelman , as well as whereupon , how science was applied to food .
the pair gave to have better understood on during the writing of the book the eating habits about ziegelmans mother-in-law - for example like it food not to throw away could .
“ a genuine fear of the wasting of food had you , ” said coe .
ziegelman remembered : “ you made people actually suffer . ”
there there was the cream puff incident .
after the plates were cleared with eisenberg &apos;s , they and coe pulled out a dessert , which they had at home prepared : the plum dessert , the president roosevelt to noon ass .
“ it is called prune whip , ” said ziegelman and added that it was a usual trick to give to modest recipes a fancy name .
there was no struck cream , only plums , something flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone immersed somewhat unwillingly a spoon into the tough , brown glibber .
it did not taste surprisingly badly .
coe got itself three times a consulting .
like a can do budgetierer he said a few chopped walnuts to his wife , “ would help . ”
with bomb attack killed : he was the hero of aleppo
it risked its own life around others to help : khaled omar .
he was the hero of aleppo : khaled omar dedicated his life to humans in syria .
it risked everything , in order to save to others the life .
now the 30-year old died even with a barrel bomb attack of the assad regime .
omar was member of the “ white helmets ” , a civil defense group , which saved so far scarcely 60,000 humans the life according to bild-zeitung .
2900 volunteer risks their own life , in order to pull and carry over in the theater of war first aid humans out from flattened with bombs houses .
they are the heroes of the war in syria .
omar was the face of the group : a video of the zivilschützers , which shows it with a 11-hour rescue of a baby from the rubble of a house , went 2014 around the world .
it made the syrian the bright symbolic figure in the grey one of the war .
as a hero he saw however never , said themselves according to picture : “ for me that is the genuine jihad . ”
“ if i die to save lives think i that god in me sees a martyr . ”
briefly before omar fell an attack to the victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bomb attacks in syria .
the helicopters threw four barrel bombs off over the alzadia district , were filled one with chlorine gas .
one woman and two children died , seven humans suffer from difficulty in breathing .
“ we eliminate now the poisonous remnants of the bomb , thereby not children thereby play ” , quoted those picture its last words before it died .
the deadly bomb of the assad regime should have met terrorists .
greenland shark : the oldest vertebrate animal is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
greenland sharks come usually only in the winter to the surface .
this shark was allowed after an investigation on board the research ship sanna in the sea back .
it was born 1624 and swims with well 1 km / h by the north atlantic - until today .
greenland sharks get only with 150 years new generation .
leisurely the greenland shark swims at the reason of the north atlantic along , in one hour comes it on the average straight 1,220 meters far .
only if it depends on it , accelerated that five meters long animal on full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast with this maximum speed as a seal .
this lifestyle coined by tardiness seems to be however a ready-made solution for a great age .
julius nielsen of the university of copenhagen and its colleagues anyhow report in the technical periodical “ science ” of a greenland shark , which could be 392 years old .
“ insanity ” , commentates alexander scheuerlein of the max planck institute for demographic research in rostock this life-span , which means a world record for vertebrate animals .
the evolution biologist assumed for a long time that greenland sharks become aged .
the proofs were only missing .
greenland sharks are difficult to observe , finally live them particularly in the polar sea before the thinly settled coasts of canada , greenland , norway and spitzbergen .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees celsius , they emerge at the surface usually only in the winter .
about the lifestyle of the greenland sharks researchers know according to few .
they measured their slow-motion , when they equipped six animals before spitzbergen with a transmitter .
these sharks make booty nevertheless : in the stomach of an animal researcher found the remnants of a seal , another the jaw bone of a young polar bear had swallowed .
possibly they hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the reason of the polar sea and look for carcasses , which stagger downward from higher water layers .
julius nielsen and its colleagues examined now 28 greenland sharks , which got fischer between 2010 and 2013 before greenland or spitzbergen as by-catch from the depth of the north atlantic .
the smallest shark was straight 81 centimeters long , while measured largest 502 centimeters .
in order to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens core of the sharks with the kohlenstoff-14-methode .
this center of the eyepiece develops already before the birth of the sharks , which become therein contained proteins later no more renewed .
the two smallest sharks had remarkably much kohlenstoff-14 in the lens core .
their birth should lie from there after the early 1960er years , when nuclear tests hurled larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in the animal third-smallest with 220 centimeters length contained the lens core against it a small surplus of kohlenstoff-14 from the nuclear tests , it might when its investigation in the year 2012 thus its 50 . birthday celebrated .
all larger greenland sharks had normal kohlenstoff-14-mengen , which results from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere in their lens core against it .
the kohlenstoff-14-uhr for a 493 centimeter actually showed long greenland shark an age of 335 years , while the record shark with 502 centimeters might be even 392 years old .
the fact that greenland shark females get only then new generation if they are longer than four meters , was well-known .
now the researchers could assign an age to the length .
since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold to sexual maturity and its age was determined with 156 years , greenland sharks with increase leave themselves obviously at least one and a half centuries time .
also that might be for vertebrate animals world record at present .
that such methuselahs live particularly in icy waters , is no coincidence .
also the past record holder , a 211 years old bowhead whale , into whose bacon at the neck 120 years an old harpoon point was , became imprisoned before alaska .
by the low temperatures frequently also the organism of the there living animals runs on low flame .
they mature thus later - and age more slowly .
in order to keep itself warm in the cold water , the animals become besides often particularly largely .

frankfurt profits from the brexit
the city at the main has therefore in the competition with paris , dublin and luxembourg the best opportunities to attract from london shifted jobs and companies .

even if quality of life is a question of the preferences : “ with its already strong position as financial location for the european domestic market frankfurt could attract further banks and investors ” , concludes the iw .
london will remain however despite brexit vote most important financial center in europe , means the economic researchers .
but also the balances of power speak : in london helaba at the end of 2015 approximately 144000 humans in the bank industry , in frankfurt worked were it 62500 in accordance with numbers of the landesbank .

partition callum skinner storms home , when a britisher achieves gold for cycling
scotland callum skinner rests last evening in the man team sprint in the velodrome in rio to the fame , when the british team defended the title of london 2012 .
the 23-year old from glasgow took the anchor role , which its compatriot sir chris hoy had made itself own . the jungspund made the legend proud , when it stormed home , in order to rake a victory of the favorites new zealand .
england claimed a shocking victory before four years , while hoy got the fifth of six olympia gold medals .
they repeated the trick , after they got a modest sixth place in march with the course world championships in london despite the resignation hoys only .
the problem between peking and london was the replacement of the anfahrers jamie staff .
they did this in time as hindes emerged .
hoys retirement produced a gap , kian emadi and matt crampton tried to close .
skinner was the man , with whom they remained , when they saw potential in the scot , which now unfolded .
hindes , kenny - which triumphed before four years with hoy - and skinner set an olympia record in the qualifying rounds , but in the standard rounds the new zealanders in the first round triumphed .
and the british trio won the duel also gold .
hindes was past after its round scarcely , but kenny brought forward the team and to skinner held it .
a change of strategy constituted a large part of the transformation , with which hindes drove in a higher course to hold in order to slow it down and to make it possible kenny and above all skinner , the speed .
hoy watched of its position as an bbc expert out and was noticeable to skinner , kenny and hindes , when these rose to the landing .
the 23-year old skinner from glasgow said : “ it is a flattering comparison . ”
i am only here , in order to do and for me a name make my best .
we set up an olympia record in the final round and defeated the world champions .
it was simply unbelievable .
there is no better kind this to win .
after triumph 2012 at the page kennys and hoys admitted hindes that he fell after a weak start intentionally on the course .
he did not withdraw this statement later and it came an objection of england rivals .
with so an outstanding victory there was this time none such problem .
hindes said : “ it feels with the whole gb of flags on the grandstand such as london . ”
we met in the last three months as a team .
we got away with so many world titles so badly that it was unbelievable to win again with the olympiad .
that is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which seven were won by 10 titles both in peking and in london .
if that is a barometer of our progress in the last five months that expect us successful five days in the velodrome .
with the form kennys is it in the range of the possible one that he repeats hoys victory of three olympic gold medals in a competition .
that became for kenny - which is 12 years younger exactly than hoy , likewise to 23 . march was born ( an apparently holy date for the british sport ; on the day also steve redgrave , mo farah and roger bannister born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal to mean .
that would equal from hoy .
kenny participates next in the sprint , which begins today and will go over three days .
the 28-year old from bolton said : “ i enjoy this only for the moment . ”
the team event is always best .
one can win it with its colleagues .
it feels somewhat lonely to win alone .
hindes said : “ if it two further gold medals wins , should be struck it to the knight . ”
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there was further good news for england .
sir bradly wiggins , od clancy , steven burke and owain doull qualified themselves with the fastest achievement in the quadripartite four-kilometer running .
they arrived at 3 : 51,942 at the goal .
the world record , which won 2012 in london gold , was with 3 : 51,659 .
the first and final round ( 22.42 ) take place today on the second day of the wettbewers , with which wiggins with security will stand in the focus .
it had argued yesterday with assigned one before the qualification , when functionaries called it to itself , in order to measure its body size .
in the appropriate woman competition , which is continued tomorrow and terminated , laura trott , joanna rowsell shand , elinor barker and katie archibald of milngavie in world record time was promoted in 4 : 13,260 .
the gb team relies on its strong course wheel team , in order to dominate the middle period of the olympic games and to get a crowd at medals .
after a indeed unusual representation of absolute dominance in peking and london expectations for rio were driven down .
drama in the background , as the resignation of the technical manager shane sutton in april in the midst of from sexism and bullying reproaches as well as the retirement took place from sizes as hoy and victoria pendleton .
if one views oneself however the first evening of the competition in the velodrome , it looks whole like it , as if the legendary call gbs , which reached its high point to the perfect moment , could be repeated again .
future of the schmelzerei of portland due to abolition of the energy contract questionably
the future of the aluminum melt of portland in victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - stand on the play , since the plant operator the energy supply contract will waive to quit and thus all supply contracts , as the supplying energy company communicated .
this step followed the decision of the government in victoria anfang of this year to assign no further subsidies for the enterprise of the plant .
for 20 years a specified subsidy runs out in november .
up to 2000 jobs in the plant of alcoa in portland stand on the play .
less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could not be endangered with a locking .
beyond that it could come to domino effects , since the schmelzerei uses approximately 10 percent of the entire generation of current of victoria .
2014 closed alcoa the point henry schmelzerei , which led last year to a locking of the anglesea of power station .
the schmelzerei of alcoa in portland loses money and risks a locking .
this step follows the speculations for many years regarding the future of the plant , originally as consequence of the strong australian dollar and last due to the electricity tariff for the plant .
agl , which supplies the large aluminiumschmelzerei with its loy yang a power station in latrobe valley , communicated that it assumes three further owners will quit their contracts .
the plant is in the majority possession a joint venture of alcoa and alumina , about which the chinese enterprise citic and the japanese marubeni corp hold smaller portions .
“ agl assumes the plant in portland is further operated , which means a further physical demand for river by the schmelzerei ” communicated the enterprise .
agl stated further that the contracts were so-called “ safeguard business ” , which should have stepped starting from november 2016 into force .
the contracts have a 12-month term of notice , so that they will end to 2017 .
“ of from there it agl assumes that the contracts will contribute in the financial year 17 to the incomes , ” said the current supplier .
all potential effects on the incomes on agl starting from the gj 18 are at present limited by the prognoses of the strong option markets for wholesale electricity tariffs .
agl communicated that it had already copied the value of the contracts in its jahresabschlus at a value of $ 187 million in “ expectation of a notice ” .
alcoa said that the decision to write the contracts off which does not impair &quot; ability alcoas … the schmelzerei to operate or the current supply to the schmelzerei not ensure ” .
the us enterprise said that it had locked 2010 a 20-annual contract with loy yang , which from november this year on to go in effect should , even if it still another explanation is guilty , why it from the contract withdrew .
analysts warn schmelzerei in victoria and the tomago plant due to bad economical conditions of the industry before the possible locking the portland in close proximity to newcastle .
in reference to the statements of the analysts anfang of the week the head of said operation stephen mikkelsen that portland and tomago approximately 900 megawatts at river use annually approximately 600 megawatts .
if both plants of the market should disappear , a substantial decrease of the demand would mean on &#91; electricity market &#93; .
and for us as generators that would not be good , ” said it .
more than only a kardashian reality tv star , kendall is on the cover of the september edition vogue
kendall jenner , 20 , model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the kardashian jenner of clan kris are on the cover of the september edition in demand of us vogue .
kendall , which is brand ambassador of estee lauder and on the fashion weeks in milan , paris and new york ran , announced the news on its instagram account on thursday .
“ in an area of full people , which i love , the sight of this cover brought me to crying , ” wrote kendall .
the exposure of cover a bizarre ( or simply keeping up with the kardashians something similar ? ) followed , scripted reality video , which shows the entire kardashian jenner family ( with exception of the cases of problem rob and caitlyn as well as in presence of the all-side popular showbiz uncle and producer of keeping up ryan seacrest ) , as they forget covers of their sister and with a classical idiom ends : they planned all a surprise party .
that represents the plate-afflicted action to almost any birthday episode of a child transmission ( seacrest brought the sentence , “ you thought that we would have forgotten you ? , ” with the honesty of an indication trick rabbit on a time slot at 8 o &apos;clock ) , but their other girls had to somehow let kris in the morning participate in this publicity .
with view to the september edition vogue began a new era of the kardashians with security .
kendalls large sister kim likes it , what concerns vogue covers , struck ( they and her man kanye west were on it in april 2014 to see ) , but covers of the september edition of the magazine is a league for itself .
the september edition is for vogue to usually most sold edition of the year .
with an extent , which resembles rather a book of pictures as a fashion magazine , the edition draws a large number on on advertisers ( sound fashionista were from the 832 pages of the tome 615 pages advertisement ) .
the exposure of its cover star is so longingly expected that in the last two years pictures of the magazine oozed still before the official publication .
women , who already were on cover , cover naomi campbell , linda evangelista and kate moss .
in the last years clearly more was “ famousnesses , those models ” than “ model , the famousnesses is ” on cover .
oscar winner and dior markenbotschafterin jennifer lawrence was 2013 on cover , one year after lady gaga the honour had .
but even with the slim chance that mrs. jenner - of the magazine as the “ break-through model ” of her generation is described - falls under the earlier category , it is it in good society .
this famousnesses is not related to famous people or reality of star or young people today , that knows , like one a good snapchat video turns ( even if of it everything applies to jenner ) .
they are really talented women , who are characterised in the entertainment industry .
beyonce , which appeared on last cover , had one of the most successful years of its career with the publication of lemonade .
naturally jenners success does not please everyone .
with its reality tv history jenners position was always somewhat strained in the fashion world .
in june the former victoria &apos;s secret model stephanie seymour jenner and her colleague gigi hadid criticized and called it “ the muck malice of the instant . ”
these feelings cooked , when the message with the appearance jenners on vogue cover came out .
but seems to pass on the moroseness to harp on the point .
kendall jenner is on the cover of the september edition vogue .

in queen country already three are rejected by five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of acts of violence and those , who have no means for unfair delogierungen and like - when their requesting on free legal advice and legal advice .
legal services of the community , which are already excessively working at full capacity , get ready for further shortening .
starting from june of next year it is intended that these right centers will lose further 30 percent of their federal funds .
the director of the gemeindrechtszentren of queesland james farrell said that the last collection of the national combination of community right centers showed that thousands of people are already rejected each year .
farrell said that the situation without an abolition of the resolution of the federal government would become only worse .
“ queen country community right centers are chronically underfunded , which meant that thousands of people are rejected by important services , which need you , ” he said .
people , which leave violent relations , people with difficult-to-understand and crushing debts , families , which go through separations , worker , who unfair-proves to dismiss became - all to have problems of legal kind and this collection it shows these people that they cannot receive the assistance , whom they need .
the federal government will shorten the means starting from june 2017 by 30 percent , which means that thousands of hilsbedürftigeren people from queen country will be forced to get along with their legal problems without any assistance .
we request the chief federal prosecutor and federal minister of justice as well as senators of queen country george brandis to waive these cuts in support immediately so that the people can receive the assistance , whom they need , for legal problems .

with the lining up elections in the federal states mecklenburg-western pomerania ( 4 september ) and berlin ( 18 september ) appear substantial losses for the government parties spd and cdu .
representative surveys of the polling institute insa for the “ picture ” showed this - newspaper ( friday ) .
while the red-black government coalition in the north could govern scarcely further , this is not possible after the poll ratings in berlin .
in both federal states the spd would be however the strongest party and would have good opportunities to place further the head of government .
in mecklenburg-western pomerania the spd of 35,6 percent fell before five years on 24 percent .
the party would lie thereby according to survey only scarcely before the cdu , which could come 23 percent .
the third place is between that linking and the afd disputed .

nokia 9000 communicator : the first smartphones
email and internet in slow motion : before 20 years nokia communicator came on the market .
the successors dominate today the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the equipment weighed nearly a half kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iphone 5 .
it was thicker and larger , it lay therefore also not well in the hand .
on the contrary , it was quite chunky .
the inserted memory amounted to at the beginning of eight megabyte , which became today for approximately two selfies with high resolution is enough .
an iphone is delivered meanwhile with at least 16 gigabyte .
“ nokia 9000 communicator ” came before exactly 20 years , on 15 august 1996 , into the business - and it was the first smartphones .
for a few euro can lover the devices still on the internet buy , but they originate somehow from the stone age of the internet age .
before 20 years however the communicator was a sensation .
the finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product few months before on the computer fair a cebit in hanover as “ office in the vest pocket format ” .
indeed , the new mobile phone knew a quantity for standards at that time : sms and e-mails could be sent and received , also by fax were the communicator to be achieved .
even that access to web pages was by html browsers possible , although tormenting slowly .
a pocket calculator was available , a digital directory and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be opened unfold similarly as a laptop .
then were a small keyboard and a monochrome screen .
the price was rather proud : 2700 d-mark , thus about 1400 euros .
the average selling price of smartphones in germany was 2015 with 392 euros .
nobody could suspect 1996 in august that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphones era .
since then is everything different .
the intelligent telephones are a success story , if also not for nokia .
the mobile phone section of the finns experienced an unprecedented disaster , at microsoft was finally sold and completed .
today providers , who came many later all than nokia , control the market .
always and everywhere online its , that is today for a great many humans everyday life .
2015 gave it world-wide almost two billion smartphones users .
were sold about 1.4 billion devices , to samsung and apple been allotted of it alone 555 million pieces .
the world-wide revenue with the devices is with approximately 400 billion euro .
in addition those come well current operations of the countless app providers and the telecommunications groups .
approximately around the smartphones in the meantime a whole industry developed .
the crucial break-through to the mass-market only at the beginning of 2007 came , at that time announced apple boss of steve jobs on the mac world the introduction of the iphone .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communicator to serve everything by touch screen easily .
the triumphant advance of apple began , this very day is the iphone the most important product of the company .
nokia , motorola and blackberry , which controlled the market , had a checking .
they disappeared finally , to blackberry have to fight .
now apple and asian providers have a saying such as samsung .
the smartphones are 20 years after its invention a matter of course .
on average today each german looks in the meantime 88 times a day on its mobile phone .
“ we must learn all to put away the smartphones also times ” , said straight janina kugel , in the siemens executive committee responsibly for staff .
permanent accessibility is considered meanwhile as curse and benediction at the same time .
england must direct the olympic spirit and extend heathrow
heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local municipalities and in all of london , but generally speaking country .
for me that represented the largest attraction heathrows , exactly the same as at that time in 2012 in london , when we operated a large expenditure , in order to guarantee that all our nations and regions profited from the plays .
the olympiad brought large advantages for stratford and the east ends .
and that will again reach , as we for local men and companies create new possibilities in close proximity to heathrow .
for our local communities we will create alone already 10,000 new training places , 40,000 new jobs and for youth unemployment in the airport environment an end will prepare .
as it us in london ahead 2012 were , it such will give , which will think that the challenge of the extension is too large heathrows .
it was told me that england will be ready for the plays never and that we will disgrace ourselves on the world stage .
the sceptics had 2012 injustice and them also with heathrow will wrongly lie .
there are always obstacles for overcoming , but heathrow answers each question posed to him .
like the olympic games heathrow for many is and not for particulars an infrastructure project .
extension is a possibility , in order to create up to 180.000 new jobs , £ 211 billion at witschaftlichem growth and to leave a legacy of abilities and occupation both around the airport and in completely gb .
we have a great team in heathrow , which a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget converted , of the t5 - which was selected five years in consequence to the world-best airport terminal , up to the t2 , which was built in the midst of the two most frequented gangways of the world .
now they stand ready a third gangway to supply , which is supported by £ 16 billions at private investments .
the london of plays of 2012 was a large success for gb and i am confident that the extension of heathrow will likewise be one .
it is time that we direct this olympic spirit and extends heathrow as well as secures our future trade and a legacy of talents and creates occupation , on which england be proud can .

adblock plus , facebook in “ katz-und mouse play ” concerning indicator blocking
for enterprises , those with online advertisement money earn equal according to one the software vendor attempts to go around indicator blocking “ katz and a mouse play ” .
on thursday , only two days after to facebook that it would block indicator blockings on its desktop side , published adblock plus announced a blog post office , in which it communicated that users could update their filters in the program , in order to block advertisement in the social network again .
on tuesday facebook communicated that its desktop side would change the encoding concerning its adverts , in order it to indicator blockings the recognition over it , which part of the side advertisement is , to make more difficult to recognize .
but adblock announced that it found a new way to go around the new codes .
in a blog post office the spokesman of adblock ben william that “ this kind is already and ago fight between indicate-blocking open source community and the umgehern since the invention of indicator blockers under way , wrote ” and that it is possible that facebook comes soon with a new solution .
the fact that the world largest enterprise for social media admitted itself into the fight , is a strong indication for it how causing concern indicator blockers for the industry became .
world-wide approximately 200 million people use indicator blockers according to a study of the last year of page fair and adobe ; nearly four times so much 2013 .
with 1.03 billion daily active users , who access facebook over their mobile terminals , mobile phone advertisement constitutes 84 percent of the advertising revenue of facebook .
the enterprise has it on indicator blockers on desktop pc foreseen , since mobile indicator blockers do not have effect on of facebook mobile app for the social network and instagram , communicated a spokesman .
advertisement on desktop pc constitutes a sufficient large portion of the incomes , so that facebook appears the investment of such a step as be worth worth .
on tuesday facebook communicated that it would update its “ indicator preference tools ” , in order to have the people more control over on it advertisement aimed at .

nasa climatic model : venus was once habitable
the venus was probably once habitable according to the projections new nasa of a climatic model .
scientists at the goddard of institutes for space studies of nasa developed a model , in order to discover the past of the venus on the basis from tools and algorithms , which resemble those from climatologists .
the model was sketched , in order to determine , whether the venus with their were called , waterless surface and co2 densities atmosphere once earthsimilar conditions to have exhibited could .
scientists pointed before to the fact that the slow revolution of the venus could be explained by their close atmosphere .
but newest simulation points to the fact that a thin , earthsimilar atmosphere could have had the venus and nevertheless slowly kept turning themselves .
the model lit up also the topography of the early venus .
the planet exhibited probably more dry areas than de erde , but had once enough water and geographical variability to accommodate over lives and before fast evaporation protected .
the early venus profited also from a sun , which was more matte 30 percent .
“ in the giss model simulation the slow revolution of the venus exposes their daily side of the sun nearly two months long , ” explained giss scientist anthony del genio in a press release .
this warms up the surface and produces rains , which creates a thick layer clouds , which like an umbrella works , in order to shield the surface from a majority of the solar heat .
the result are average temperatures , which are cool some degrees as those the earth today .
the model brought a history out of the venus , which the evolution resembles , which was assumed before by planet researchers .
although it was probably habitable once , were the venus -- in the run more mehrer billions years --too much heat and ultraviolet light suspended .
its oceans evaporated and its water vapour by the ultraviolet light one burned away .
as its hydraulic gene stayed only a thick atmosphere at carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect escaped -- the venus , which like we know it today .
the researchers divided the results of their new venus klimamodells in the geophysical research letters .

nordeseeölarbeiter take up again discussions , suspend strike
the labor disputes concerning the remuneration for north sea oil workers suspended , while all parties to the dispute for a new round of talks sit down to the table , said negotiators .
strikes against the oil field service provider wood group were accomplished sporadically on platforms in the north sea , which are operated by royal dutch shell .
“ wood group as well as the unite and fcs trade unions can confirm that we united us to begin the completion process of the present controversy again ” are called it in a common statement .
we will hold some all day meetings in the next weeks , will begin at the beginning of next year , in order to concern the problems again .
the trade unions said that their last strike , which is first in over 25 years was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
wood group shortened this year the rates to its kontraktoren in the north sea around approximately 9 percent due to negative market printing .
the rate shortening of the enterprise follows a 10-percent decrease for onshore contractors in the year 2014 .
the enterprise said that additional shortening the necessary area to the enterprise gives , in order to come by the market wing over .
shell announced plans for its part thousand from people to dismiss and to give its oil and gas business activities up in up to 10 countries since it rationalizes its business activities as consequence of its megaunion with the british energy company bg group .
energy companies are due to the lower crude oil prices under pressure , an economic situation , which itself by the decision of the british in june to leave the european union had strengthened .

2016 is expected on the average approximately less than $ 1.4 billion at expenditures for new projects in the north sea compared with $ 7 billion in the last five years .
kepler does without rotation rate of stars in the heap of star of the pleiads
the newest mission with the kepler space telescope helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalog at rotation rates under the stars of the heap of star of the pleiads .
the new data help to understand the astronomers , as well as why stars in the heap of star rotate themselves to different rates in which connection the rotation periods with the planet emergence .
“ we hope that we experience more by comparing our results with other heaps of star , over the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , ” said luisa rebull , a researcher at the caltech &apos;s infrared processing and analysis center in pasadena , in a press release .
the heap of star of the pleiads lies 445 light-years remotely from the earth .
many stars in this heap of star , which originated in approximately 125 million years ago , reach now the adult age .
they turn now fastest .
to point rotation rates these maturing stars discharge large quantities of star hoists .
since this hoist by the magnetic fields of the stars travel , they have a braking effect on the stars .
if a star ages , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
kepler does without the rotation rate of each star , by he the time between the appearance of a recognizable star mark -- like sunspots -- recognizes .
the newest catalog of rotation rates points out that more solid stars turn more slowly than less solid stars .
rebull compares the stars with dancers , whereby larger stars of slow pirouettes turn as smaller .
“ in “ clench ” the pleiads see we that slow rotors tend to be more substantial whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright of stars ” said to rebull .
since the heap of star of the pleiads is so close , it serves as ideal cosmic laboratory , in order to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates .
“ the heap of star of the pleiads offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stellar rotation in both directions , younger and older , ” said rebull .
it lies still much before us about what we gladly to learn more wants , how how , when and why stars slow their rotation rates down and hang their “ dancing pumps up ” as it were .
rebull and their colleagues reported in detail in three newspaper reports on its newest analysis of the rotation rates of the pleiads , which will appear soon in the astronomical journal .
a disputed baseball star retires
the tears ran with alex rodriguez faster than the us-baseball-star in best days from base to base .
after his emotional resignation publication the 41 years old professional will carry a last mark the tricot of its new york yankees on 12 august against the tampa bay rays .
“ i love this play and this team . ”
“ i say &apos; goodbye &apos; to both ” , explained the 14-malige all-star game participant major league baseball ( mlb ) .

up to the end of the contract on 31 december 2017 it functions in the future than advisors and youth coach - with full content .
as a player it paid rodriguez back long time with achievement .
with 696 homeruns , 3114 hits and 2021 points for its teams ( “ run ” ) for the seattle mariners ( 1994 to 2000 ) , texas rangers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the yankees it created some milestones .
with the resound of fame members hank aaron and willie mays exhibit only two further baseball players in the most important statistics similar values .
but into the fame hall of the baseball the 41-year old might not be taken up nevertheless .
because rodriguez - nickname “ a-rod ” - on the field was so successful , so disputed is its occurrence outside of the place .
already 2009 admitted the superstar with “ espn ” between 2001 and 2003 forbidden steroids to itself to have taken .
in august 2013 it became closed due to an involvement in the so-called biogenous sis scandal to at the end of 2014 for 211 portions .
rodriguez is considered as a main suspect for many years over a anti aging hospital in south florida work-promoting means to have received .
after a law case the barrier was reduced still to 162 meetings .
“ the league could have done for the year 2014 even a favour to me , because i had played , said 20 years to the end without break ” rodriguez at that time smugly .
also its parting days do not pass noiseless .
while many baseball legends in their last plays receive again the large stage , rodriguez had to sit frequently on the bank .
“ my job does not contain a parting tour . ”
“ my job contains the attempt to win each play ” , corroded yankee coach joe girardi .
nevertheless rodriguez , which was married with the actress cameron diaz and to who conditions with pop star madonna and the actress kate hudson are repeated , got sympathy declarations of the fans about the yankee archrival boston talks sox .
“ incoming goods want a-rod ” , sang the supporters with the 4 : 9-niederlage against the rodriguez team .
olympia 2016 : chen xinyi , silwia danekowa and adrian zielinski are first cases of doping
gotten : because of positive doping sample weight lifter adrian zielinski from poland may not start in rio .
rio de janeiro - which become olympic games 2016 overshadowed by first official cases of doping .
a gotten athlete would have won nearly a medal .
before the seventh match day first official cases of doping are the olympic games in rio de janeiro admit become .
the chinese swimmer chen xinyi , 3000-meter-hindernisläuferin silwia danekowa from bulgaria and the polish weight lifter adrian zielinski were tested positively and excluded in brazil - directly before the beginning of the anyway critically eyed track-and-field events competitions these news comes to the wrong time .
with chen on past sunday the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide had been already proven , which is used as masking means for doping ubs dancing .
the international sport court of justice cas confirmed its exclusion of the olympic games on friday afternoon local time .
on sunday the 18-year old fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly had occupied , only by 0.09 seconds missed it thereby the bronze medal .
on friday chen should have participated in the advances over 50 m freestyle .
chen requested the opening of the b-sample and a hearing at the international olympic committee ( ioc ) .
the national federation takes the affair “ very seriously and requires of chen full co-operation with the investigations ” , to quoted xinhua from a report : “ we will co-operate with the international sport court of justice cas and will become the judgement to accept ” .
for the first time in history no more is responsible the ioc , but cas for sanctioning the sportsmen with positive cases .
likewise in the night of rio the message oozed over the positive sample with danekowa , the 33-year old went thereby even into the offensive .
“ i had three tests , all negatively , and my fourth test was ” , this was positively “ an unbelievable shock ” , said it to the bulgarian tv-transmitter bnt .
it is innocent , “ the only explanation could food supplements be ” , explained the athlete .
according to the report it is to concern with the forbidden substance the blood doping agent epo .
danekowa was provisionally suspended , according to bnt is to have already positively failed also the b-sample .
of bulgaria prime minister bojko borissow announced itself immediately with criticism at the athlete to word .
“ i do not understand , why the sportsmen draw , said not the correct conclusions ” he : “ we bulgarian stand under observation , so many were already excluded ” .
so about all weight lifters from the chronically doping-loaded nation may not participate in rio .
on friday also the case became “ adrian zielinski ” admits , who became london olympia winner in the class up to 85 kg like its brother tomasz three days before positively on the anabolic steroid nandrolon tested .
both deny the income , both may however not in the class up to 94 kg start .
before the start of the light athletes the case danekowa is particularly a further heavy impact for the reputation of the entire kind of sport .
the world union iaaf had forbidden with one exception because of systematic doping the start , also the runner nation kenya to the complete russian crew produced in rio numerous bad news .
in swimming besides earlier offences in china had ensured for violent arguments also between the athletes .
thus the frenchman camille lacourt attacked the chinese olympia winner sun yang harshly .
“ sun yang pees purple . ”
“ if i the podium over 200 m freestyle see , want to hand over i ” , said myself lacourt in the french radio .
sun was located besides in the center of an argument with the australian mack horton .
“ i do not have time and no respect for doping cheats ” , said to this .
sun had been positively tested 2014 with the chinese championships on the stimulant trimetazidin , had to serve however only a three-month barrier .
datenklau : so perfidiously hackers extort their ransom money
programmers von erpressungs-malware seize up-to-date aimed enterprises on and are successful thereby .
according to a current survey of the malware defense specialists malware bytes under 540 enterprises in north america , great britain and germany 40 percent of the asked companies became at least once , partly repeated in the past twelve months victims of an attack with blackmailer software .
in germany scarcely 20 percent of the companies was already once a goal of an ransomware extortion .
readily the ransom money demanded by the perpetrators paid 40 percent of the victims , in order to be able to use the attacked systems and data again .
the perpetrators specialize their blackmailer software appreciably according to the observations of malware bytes in attacks into firm networks .
if they are there successful , that fails potential ransom money which can be extorted clearly more highly than with private users .
“ we observe up-to-date a terrifying fast evolution of the malware ” , explain malware byte boss of marcin kleczynski in the discussion with the “ world ” .
2008 was appropriate most malware programs still to send advertisement away .
then the perpetrators discovered extortion software for itself .
first private users were the goal , but the change to firm attacks took place in the past months alarmingly fast .
ransomware works after a simple sample : once on the computer of a victim actively , it looks for purposefully after recently changed files as for instance word , excel or database files as well as after archives of pictures and videos .
these files code the ransomware and delete the originals effectively .
subsequently , the software presents the demands of the blackmailers .
in order the final key code to the files too gotten , the victims money - usually in form of the cryptowährung bitcoin - must transfer .
but where with private users the personal photo database stands on the play , it concerns at companies sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production stands still .
accordingly more highly the damage fails , if a ransomware slams shut .
22 percent of the german companies concerned turnover losses announced by ransomware , to 13 percent had even the business activity completely to interrupt , to a case were humans in mortal danger .
in germany hospitals victims of attacks , whose patient can be threatened by the loss of patient documents acutely , were already repeated .
“ we always say to the victims : does not pay , if you promotes thereby only the problem ” , kleczynski explains .
but 80 to 90 percent of the companies , which pay , gets their data back .
for managers it is difficult to reject in view of stop in the enterprise the demand of the perpetrators .
the hackers again know that and try everything , in order to develop a good reputation .
in a current study the safety researchers of f-secure examined the user surfaces and the contact with the blackmailers and to come to the result : the perpetrators actually try to develop a kind customer service in order to take more funds .
they explain to their victims by chat , how they can pay by bitcoin , furnish freely accessible support websites or decode in vain example files .
and private individuals are released after payments by few hundred euros , must negotiate enterprises partly hard and pay sums of five figures , in order to get back their data unencrypted .
in view of the potential high and profits relatively without risk from the ransomware extortion the hackers ever more professionally and to divide the work , explains itself security expert chester wisniewski of the anti-virus provider sophos : “ individual person can write a ransomware about within one week . ”
more probable is it however that it concerns three or four people .
the programmers sell their malware then in form of a software component system to the actual blackmailers .
the past malware kits developed , as the malware , consultation and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollar were bought .
“ adjustment tools are contained in the scope of supply , so that smaller configurations , appearance and development of brands can be changed ” , say wisniewski .
the blackmailers look for each other then further hackers , in order to spread the freshly bought software among the victims .
we live in a service economy .
one logs oneself thus into one of the forums in the underground , buys the set of a criminal one and assigns a further to install the software on as much as possible pcs .
the payment takes place per infected computer .
“ usually the criminal ones assign then spammer the spreading ” , explain wisniewski .
the risk of ransomware is meanwhile well-known with many enterprises , which secure their data better .
over 50 percent trust the company it responsible person in the malware byte survey to be able to repel ransomware by means of file baking ups and scannersoftware .
accordingly the perpetrators pursue already new strategies .
“ if the encoding of data alone no sufficient threat for successful erpessung more is , threatens the perpetrators instead with the publication of sensitive data as for instance , malware byte boss of marcin kleczynski explains customer master lists or price estimations ” .
thus the damage potential is higher depending upon kind of the data still around a multiple than before .
also the perpetrators could take in the future completely new goals on the internet the things on the grain .
to the conference of hacker defcon demonstrated safety researchers , how they could get a connected thermostat with the internet under their control .
in the middle in the winter de-energizing of an in such a manner blocked heating so some victim could quite be worth a ransom money .
if the perpetrators block a whole production line in a factory then instead of the heating in the future , ransomware could become also in the industry 4,0 a topic .
one for all cases
honda hr-v is flexible and suitable for daily use
into the small hr-v honda wants to pack everything : little suv , little coupé and also still the versatility of a minivan .
sounds rather overloaded , but the hr-v , which was designed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves in the everyday life as expressed flexible .
although only the 1.60 m work high hr-v rather small , the passengers have both in the front row and in the fund much place , works nowhere closely .
the materials of the interior are well finished and work pleasantly , only the cockpit top side drop there somewhat .
more versatile than comparable vehicles the hr-v is with the reservoir .
a trunk is not only available highranking and 1026 l of 453 l at with turned down backrests , but there are the “ magic seat ” .
that is less magic , than it sounds : the seat faces of the back bank can be lifted up and offered like cinema armchairs thereby reservoir , which is high from the ground to covering 1.24 m .
the trunk can be loaded well , however loading height with 650 mm is somewhat higher than with comparable peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1,6-l-diesel with 88 kw / 120 hp accelerates the hr-v owing to the torque of up to 300 nm in far speed ranges very strong .
he might perform its work however somewhat more quietly .
the everyday life consumption of 4,7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is still another further motorization : a 1,5-l-benziner with 96 kw / 130 hp .
an all-wheel drive is not offered .
the handling is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
the steering element might be somewhat more direct however .
the equipment does not leave desires open in the tested top variant “ executive ” .
to the safety systems belong the town center emergency brake assistant ( works to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the trace retaining assistant .
the kollisionswarner irritates sometimes , because it evaluates many obstacles when ranking as “ approaching objects ” .
the high beam assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed controller reacted to the road sign recognition and throttles if necessary the speed .
full connectivity gives it however only for the top equipment : 7-zoll-touchscreen , navi , app integration and more .
two usb and a hdmi socket are under the arm rest and are somewhat pedantic therefore to reach .
those approximately 29000 euros for the well equipped top diesel are correct .
who does not want to invest so much , receives the gasoline-driven car starting from 20000 euros , the diesel starting from 23000 euros .
the engines fulfill the euro-6-abgasnorm .
with the hr-v honda offers a versatile and suitable for daily use car .
airline does not cling : fall on aircraft passenger bridge
an airline is not responsible for the fall of a passenger on the aircraft passenger bridge .
because a liability is only with dangers conceivably , which are typical for air traffic , argued the higher regional court duesseldorf ( az . : 18 u 124 / 14 ) .
the plaintiff had broken with the fall a kneecap .
the accident could have however everywhere happened - so the court concerns a general life risk .
the airline did not have to pay compensation to the man .
medical case : when the organizer pays
gotten sick holiday-makers get back money after their travel only if the cause of the illness is to be found free of doubts in the hotel .
that is however the case only if more evidentially the same symptoms show than ten percent of the guests .
in the case negotiated a family was on the second day of its turkey vacation heavily at diarrhea and vomiting gets sick .
she spent nearly the entire vacation in the room .
the holiday-makers attributed their illness to a defective purification plant , which had gotten allegedly the sea water dirty .
the family was the opinion , the travel thereby unsatisfactorily was - and complained against the organizer .
in court the plaintiffs did not have a success .
the purification plant was indeed defective .
but the organizer experienced only shortly before departure of the plaintiffs from it .
it had to assume by then the sea water was correct .
it did not injure its duties to supply information thus , so the judgement .
particularly since in the samples of the water no impurities were found .
the illness of several hotel guests - possibly by infection among themselves - belongs to the general life risk .
were from 691 guests only 38 gets sick .
de maizière said , after the acts of violence in wuerzburg and ansbach , committed by refugees , in july would have many humans concern before further attacks .
the state must react deliberated and decided at the same time to dangers of terrorism .
is safe : our country will not answer the force of the perpetrators with hate and splitting .
we will not grant the terrorists to this triumph .
if offenders had to leave faster the country , increase however security and strengthened also the agreement of the population for the refugee politics .
de maizière wants to reach a conversion of the proposals up to the election to the bundestag 2017 .
he announced also a further personnel reinforcement of the security forces , “ in middle order of magnitude four digit over several years ” .
sympathy advertisement for terrorism must stand again under punishment .
closed circuit television is to be improved , the gun law to be in such a way amended that above all the purchase by weapons on the internet one makes more difficult .
those last much discussed professional secrecy for physicians is to remain protected after de maizières words .
however it wants to search in the dialogue with the medical profession for solutions , how the endangerment of the citizens can be reduced , said it with view approximately on psychological distinctive features .
in order to work against a radicalization of refugees , the minister considers a better social support necessary .
instructors would have to be prepared better for handling traumatized humans .
for the pursuit of criminal ones within special ranges of the internet ( darknet ) de maizière plans the employment of covered investigators .
spd head gabriel said : “ the spd is ready to talk about everything which contributes to it , security further to increase ” .
it is important that the minister of the interior expressed itself clearly against excessive desire for action .
“ that was a slap for the hell-raisers in the cdu / ccsu ” , said gabriel to the newspapers the spark medium group ( friday ) .
de maizière had rejected calls from the union before after a burka prohibition and the abolishment of the double nationality .
consider a general prohibition of the full concealment it constitutionally problematic .
one cannot forbid everything , what one rejects , and i reject carrying the burka .
one knows speeches over rules for instance in the traffic or for witnesses in court .
green boss simone peter accused , he wants with always new anti-terror packages energy and capacity to act to the minister to simulate .
left party chief bernd riexinger said : “ fleet of sayings and an aggravation of the unlimited right to residence do not bring in this country any more security ” to humans .
better flow of traffic on the feeder route
accumulates regularly on the by-pass road - here a picture from november .
but that is to change : the right turn-off lane is to be extended .
that is a good message for all drivers , who in the rush hour on the environment road each evening in the back-up , if they drive over the feeder route ( a 43 ) .
the national enterprise road construction extends on coming tuesday and wednesday ( 16 . / 17 august ) within the range between the hammer road and the departure weseler road the rechtsabbiegerspur around 700 meters .
drivers can contrive then directly from the hammer road right .
the large advantage : traffic divides itself more promptly , whereby the global process on the much-traveled section of the federal highway 51 is improved .
the idea with the extended exit had the cdu parliamentary group in the district agency münster west .
the lane narrowing on the feeder makes the drivers nervous particularly between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
the back pressure reaches sometimes also beyond that on workdays up to the bridge over the albersloher way and .
reason is the needle eye on b 51 shortly before the departure weseler road .
traffic only single-lane one is directed off here over the motorway bridge .
the second trace had to be back-built forwards for years well in-three-quarter .
the reason : static calculations had showed that the bridge does not possess no more the necessary carrying capacity , in order to take up above all the heavy transport two-lane .
how long this bottleneck and the associated work-daily back-up will persist , the responsible national enterprise cannot say .
however is to be counted with years : because the bridge has an official rest service life up to the year 2034 .
for the extension of the right turn-off lane the national enterprise selected consciously the traffic-weaker time in the vacations , because on handicaps is to be counted .
traffic is led past on tuesday and on wednesday single-lane at the building site .

rain instead of meteors : hope for weather improvement
the weather made the meteor guckern in the southwest of germany at the night friday a line by the bill - nevertheless there is still hope .
the night was badly suitable because of clouds and rains to observe the sky spectacle said a chairman of the observatory welzheim , hans-ulrich keller , on friday morning .
our hope is on the night to saturday .
the weather should be good , then see we determines many meteors in the sky .
with the star sheds it concerns perseiden , which belong at 216000 kilometers per hour to the fastest meteors .
they have their name , because they come apparently from the constellation perseus , which comes up in the northeast .
restful night : hint against sleep disturbances
in the evening one turns over eternally , at night lies itself one awake for hours , in the morning is already far before that bell bells no longer of sleep to be thought .
that is everything but restful .
one nevertheless is with such problems in good society : according to robert koch-institut about a quarter of the adults sleep disturbances and more do not have their sleep as ten percent to feel frequently or permanently than restful .
how do sleep problems or sleep disturbances express themselves ?
there are several forms of sleep disturbances , and various causes can be the basis for them , stress hans-günter weeß , vorstandsmitglied of the german society for sleep research and sleep medicine .
which one understands popularly by it , are however the insomnie , thus an in and a durchschlafstörung .
many humans feel straight sleeping through as unsatisfactory or say insufficient , jens wagenknecht , vorstandsmitglied in the german family doctor federation with practice in the varel of lower saxony .
what is behind sleep disturbances ?
the causes of sleep disturbances are complex .
behind it organic , psychological or behavior-conditioned factors , in addition , medicines can put .
pretty often the sleep disturbance is expression of another illness .
“ very early waking up is particularly frequent with a depression ” , says weeß .
and it can be that different factors cause each other .
who has for example a herniated disc , can lie badly , wakes up all two to three hours and possibly begins , over everyday problems and - to brood , give weeß ensure an example .
that leads to strain , and sleep is not possible any longer .
starting from when should one with sleep disturbances to the physician ?
who sleeps during one period of one month at least three nights per week not well and is impaired on the day , weeß should go to the physician , guesses / advises .
the impairment can look completely different : one is reduced , tired , unausgeschlafen , has difficulties with the attention and the concentration , is easily attractionable , has changes in mood or physical complaints such as stomach or headache .
in order to alleviate the sleep disturbance , is important it to find their causes out .
as treatment options are applicable among other things changes of behavior , a cognitive behavior therapy or also medicines - classical sleeping pills only in the exceptional case and at the most for two weeks - .
the established sleep medical profession it hardly gives , stresses leiter of the interdisciplinary sleep-medical center of the charité university university of berlin in germany professor ingo fietze .
therefore one should turn for sleep problems first to the family doctor , guesses themselves weeß .
that can clarify with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should in the sleep laboratory , and which happens there ?
to the investigation in the sleep laboratory the medical profession guess / advise for example when snoring with breath dropouts , with diseased daily tiredness , with sleep-walkers or if one does not find the cause of a durchschlafstörung , fietze explains .
for the investigation to prepare one does not have itself actually .
one should spend the day normally .
“ only please ” fietze make , say no midday sleep .
to wiring one goes to its normal time to bed .
beside the electrodes at the body one carries nose glasses , a chest belt and a feeler at the finger .
besides a camera at the cover notes to the sleeping .
how can concerning the problems get into the grasp ?
there are rather many set screws , at which one can set for a better sleep .
weeß enumerates : regular sleeping and rising times , not too long in bed are , because of the day do not sleep , do not watch television for falling asleep , alcohol avoid and on the clock do not look at night - then one begins to count immediately , and that is not favorable at all .
which has the dschungelcamp with missing medals in swimming too
the former german float markus deibler expressed itself by facebook for disappointing cutting of the dsv team off with olympis .
in december 2014 it had gotten and set up gold with the short course world championships in doha for the first time thereby its first world record at the same time .
now the former dsv athlete placed itself markus deibler via facebook protecting before its ex-teamkollegen in the criticism .
“ in a country , in which an olympia winner gets 20.000 € premium and a jungle king 150.000 € should themselves surprise nobody at missing medals ” , wrote the 26-year old at the night to friday on his facebook side .
the haulage system in swimming is badly , doping controls however very good .
with it we cannot compete with countries , which promote very much and with the topic doping do not look so exact or it to even operate .
“ i do not say that controls are to be stopped here ” , explained he further .
if it wanted to start a comeback , deibler would have to be announced already nine months before its first start of the national anti-doping agency germany ( nada ) .
exactly the same one should hold it also with countries .
“ who can be controlled not a certain time before wm / os by independent testers of the wada / fina , may not participate ” , demands for that choice elections , which operates meanwhile an ice-cream parlor .
airport : gang arrested by luggage thieves
professional thieves at the airport duesseldorf
to civil investigators of the düsseldorfer police the arrest of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years succeeded on thursday .
the suspects had committed several bag and luggage thefts as gang .
around 21.30 o &apos;clock civilian officials within the range of the airport duesseldorf recognized a gang again , which admits the policeman from past theft crimes was .
the two women and two men had committed since in the middle of july of this year several crimes and thereby arbeitsteilig and particularly professionally had at the community level , proceeded .
the specialists of the criminal commissioner &apos;s office 34 can prove four acts to the thieves , who had entered particularly for committing from criminal offences to germany .
they had carried off altogether over 15,000 euros .
old buildings , a few lime tree small trees , occasionally still another rest of cobblestones : the rigaer road in berlin friedrichshain does not work at first sight in such a way , but the police ranks her among the “ dangerous places ” of the city .
if one goes along the road from the east to the west , one goes past at playgrounds , a freshpainted kindergarten and a health-food shop .
to the front of a grey house someone has “ ugly ! ” sprayed .
opposite of a lidl , which is to be torn off also soon , already one builds : until 2017 are to develop here a house with high windows and 133 new rented flats .
articles over this “ trendy quarter ” , how the responsible real estate company calls friedrichshain , are illustrated in the last weeks however preferentially with burning cars .
reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile has the inhabitants leases , in the ground floor is however still areas occupied and for events is used .
particularly the citizen of berlin senator of the interiors henkel had expressed itself since the beginning of the year several times for a hard action of the police against the project , which calls area “ no-go-zone ” for policemen and the 94 as starting point of autonomous force .
after on 22 june the areas in the ground floor , which had been vacated kadterschmiede , with 300 police officers , patrolled the police three weeks long official statements according to with 30 to 40 officials and closed three crew cars locally , parts of the road and visitor held from it , the house with the number 94 to enter .
meanwhile construction workers reconditioned the areas on behalf the unknown home-owners .
on 13 july a citizen of berlin administrative court decided that those had been illegal evacuation , and later police and construction workers under the jubilation took one day off from sympathizers and adjacents resident .
in this summer afternoon the road works peacefully : parents go walking with children , people sit on the sidewalk before the houses in the sun , other one converse before the späti .
in direct proximity of the house projects a primary school and kindergartens lie .
left force is not the main concern of many adjacents resident : kerstin neugebauer , which lives since 1999 in the neighbourhood , and jana * , who nurse here three children , are particularly made nervous of the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the house projects they divide the concern before rising rents and gentrification .
it does not sound after a neighbourhood , which by the majority police protection forwards vandalierenden themselves linking longed for .
the ditch , which the citizen of berlin senator of the interiors and the police between squatters and their neighbours opens , so obviously does not exist .
friedrichshain in the east of berlin was actually a traditional worker quarter , which has a low average income and a high poverty risk also today in the comparison to the rest of the city .
also house occupations and the apartment projects born from it belong for a long time to the neighbourhood : 1990 numerous houses in the former gdr occupied , among them almost the entire mainz road close by the rigaer .
while the mainz under large police presence in a proper street battle one had vacated , many were legalized the projects in the rigaer and are inhabited partly still today by the people , which had occupied them before 26 years .
at the same time that became quarter in the last years increasing the magnet for tourists and choice elections from all over the world : with them now adjacents resident from gdr times and former squatters their neighbourhood divide .
that becomes apparent also with the rents , which rose since 2009 with new lettings around nearly 60 percent .
many the new buildings in the rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development : one recognizes it by thrown in disks or freshly painted fronts , which were thrown with color bags .
no other road was so often mentioned this year together with the words “ left-autonomous force ” .
a reason for it that not all neighbours view that as problem , could be that they are not necessarily affected by the crime : criminal offences such as bodily injury are directed according to statistics almost exclusively against policemen .
damages constitute the largest part of the criminal offences , which meet tendentious rather the new buildings and freshly reconditioned houses .
for kerstin neugebauer , which lives for 17 years in a dwelling house beside the disputed 94 , no speech can be from uncertainty .
which concerns acts of violence , she is appeasing : the people in the 94 are their neighbours , those that were not certainly .
also the famous burning cars do not give it directly in the rigaer already longer no more .
for the studied architect its road is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : “ here one helps each other , lives together on the road and receives more from each other , than elsewhere ” .
neugebauer pulled consciously remained into the rigaer road - and .
therefore it was also so important to it that the adjacents resident its road got back : of the police , the policy and the media , which suddenly claimed all in july the interpretation sovereignty over the quarter .
but in the eyes of inhabitants such as neugebauer the road is further taken away from them : by faceless new buildings in former building gaps , which displace the old inhabitants .
“ those are finally free-hold flats , which are not interesting for many here - here live rather people , which are not so well moneyed ” , say them .
“ i cannot approve force and destruction absolutely . ”
but which one is to make , if never someone listens to one ?
there frustration begins , also with the police and the inhabitants on all sides .
for tightening , which is annoyed at color bombs , kerstin neugebauer has little understanding : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the neighbourhood .
who pulls , its should be conscious - exactly like someone , which pulls into a bar district , badly about noise to weight there can .

urbach : annika deuschle is new refugee-assigned
annika deuschle is the partner in things integration and organizer .
in addition it is social female worker locally .
since july annika deuschle is the refugee-assigned for urbach .
the social teacher supports the team of the administration around achim grockenberger .
she sees herself as a partner for all participants : refugees , working group refugee work , administration , authorities and who otherwise still mixes together .
regine kunde of the working group suggests that the honorary ones are than grateful more that deuschle is now there , the egg-laying woolly milch sow , which has above all a problem .
thus some - less scoffing than rather on the variety on desire fields of application aiming at - had meant , when the administration wanted to write the place out .
an administration employee was looked for with a talent for languages and humans , connected with an experience of many years within the range of the social work , just an egg-laying woolly milch sow .
but clerical work is not their central range , means annika deuschle .
above all go it around organization , work with humans locally and also behind the scenes as well as to network activity .
the 31-year old participates for approximately six weeks .
it limited a 50-prozent-stelle on three years .
“ it was high time ” , says regine kunde that annika deuschle supports honoured and full-time participants .
there are large and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems .
soon new containers are located in the which road
a serious problem is it for some time to find apartments for the connection refugees who were recognized .
for the connection accommodation the municipalities are responsible .
they must accommodate the refugees in own or rented dwellings .
the costs of the building , the rent or the renovation of these accommodation must carry the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the district administration office on municipality and job centre .
problem : there are free objects , but not each landlord wants to offer its apartment .
the search turns out for some time as very difficult .
de facto the administration does not find private apartments .
it does not function so far , one is dependent on private dwellings , like that deuschle .
therefore gemeindliche apartments must be trained , as it is called so beautiful .
thus soon new containers in the which road are set up .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , is itself regine kunde and annika deuschle united .
beside a firm lodging there is internship places , apprentice positions , school places , one-euro-jobs and temporary jobs for refugees and migranten , who gefundnen or must be furnished .
“ would be good more places ” , reports regine kunde .
many work in the building yard or help caretakers , settle non-profit work - and motivates and very properly , as annika deuschle reports .
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
that is not “ occupation therapy ” .
activity does not however only mean work .
the day needs a firm structure , says deuschle and customer .
humans would have to develop a sense of belonging .
thus need it offers such as sport , contacts with native ones and above all language courses .
professional courses are rsr .
thus administration and honorary ones substitute also here .
it is central vision that the refugees get the feeling , it is desired and welcome in germany .
the long duration of the procedures is a problem .
they must explain to the refugees that it lasts just and it meaningfully can bridge the time , for example with language courses .
who develops the feeling sometime , he can in urbach nobody help , may not work and is useless , which will never integrate itself .
the clear majority is motivated .
there are cases of problem in addition , say , customer honestly , “ people , at which nothing at all does not go ” . the work of deuschle and customer are always also to motivate others .
all this is already a “ giant task ” .
a difficult question : do the two have fear of radicalization after the recent occurrences , also in a small community such as urbach ?
“ no ” , regine kunde says completely clearly , “ which some naively call may ” . a residual risk can not exclude and does not want it however .
sensitized however already are the aides .
these incidents are also topic with the refugees .
those would have the fear that the assassins bring them completely in disrepute .
“ you want to show that they have to do thereby nothing ” , say regine kunde .
many would remain gladly in urbach .
thus head and honorary ones must hold locally and in the region after activities look out .
they have always in the background that soon a new impact at refugees and migranten could come to urbach .
does germany need an upper limit ?
this question clearly to answer , is afraid the policy .
actually it is unfair to place it to aides locally .
“ in urbach we arrived not yet , where we would like ” , say annika deuschle .
no new refugees , which would ease the situation .
regine kunde makes likewise clear that the urbacher is working at full capacity already to integrate past humans reasonably .
those are at present approximately 100 people , predominantly young men .
but if humans are in emergency , one must help them , is itself both women united .
the political international situation is not so complicated , there gives it simple answers .
