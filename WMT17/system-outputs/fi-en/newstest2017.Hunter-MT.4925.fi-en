the requirements of the new leading lääkäriharjoittelijat strike :
the representatives of the junior doctors are asked who will be holding their kiistassaan to adopt the new industrial action on a new treaty .
the british medical association ( bma ) -lääkäriliiton junior doctors committee ( iccp ) ( jdc ) to ask the council as a whole to support the new collective measures since the beginning of september .
jdc says that ministers have failed to address the concerns about the agreement .
lääkäriharjoittelijat and lääkäriopiskelijat voted in july in its rejection of the treaty , which was agreed with the bma .
58 % of the votes cast members rejected it .
thursday evening , in a letter published via twitter to the members of the jdc &apos;s president ellen mccourt , said that the government had remained &quot; stubbornly silent &quot; issues , which he said led to the rejection of the agreement .
he said : &quot; in the light of the jdc &apos;s government has voted in favour of the complete rejection of the proposed new contract and demand for the formal uudelleenneuvotteluja all of your concerns . &quot;
in response to the government &apos;s silence jdc &apos;s government has today submitted a formal request for the council of the bma , in order to have for the increasing gradually , starting in the early hours of september and an expanding työtaisteluohjelmalle will mandate .
kiistasta has followed that junior doctors have taken part in six strikes this year , including the first complete työnseisaukseen in the history of the nhs in the healthcare system .
bma &apos;s junior doctors leader , a doctor johann malawana , resigned after the vote was rejected the agreement , negotiated by the bma &apos;s recommended by the conditions .
he had told members of the bma &apos;s meetings before the vote of 54 000 one -opiskelijan and that the agreement was a good one , and it should not be tolerated .
after the vote , the health minister jeremy hunt said that the agreement will be to impose the doctors in england .
russia and turkey : external consortium of ?
gesture , which was closed to the crisis .
the russian and turkish leaders met on tuesday kätelläkseen and eight months of each other in order to declare the words and the economic sanctions battle officially closed .
but vladimir putin tervehtiessä turkish cypriot colleague kullatussa palace in st petersburg in the room , i had a clear impression that ankara wants this reconciliation more .
yes , the käteltiin at the ceremony .
but mr putin , with a smile , and he seemed to be väkinäiseltä uhkunut little heat , even in their own hillittyjen according to the standards .
recep tayyip erdogan , in contrast , has spoken of the &quot; dear constantly about her friend &quot; putin - five times , according to one report .
sekosin bills .
he also vowed that relations with russia is not only to return to the pre-crisis levels , but even better .
the following day , the newspapers here described mr erdogan ’ s käyttäytyneen than nothing bad would never happened .
personally , i think it was his enthusiasm for the opposite .
but putin säteilevä viileys showed that the russian leader has not forgotten about anything .
in fact , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening remarks : when turkey shot down a russian combat aircraft to the syrian border .
moscow &apos;s reaction at the time , was furious .
putin was attacked by accusing ankara for the fact that it puukotti moscow pat on the back .
an attack was even worse when it came to the oletetulta friend .
the restoration of confidence is going to be difficult , perhaps impossible .
the russian public opinion has also changed since november .
for months , the state-controlled media led to the astonishing , an attack against ankara .
all of a sudden , it seemed that the turks were to blame for everything .
the most serious of these were the senior officials of the accusations that mr erdogan &apos;s own family has benefited from the illegal assets hallitsemilta from the islamic state in syria .
he has denied this .
but in st petersburg , the official message was that it is time to move on .
after all , this meeting took place only because of the fact that mr putin , she received an apology to president erdogan .
russia has reached some sort of victory .
ceasefire agreement to ankara , the benefits are clear .
first of all , mr erdogan needs all the friends after he almost were ousted from power last month in the aborted coup d &apos;état .
the continuing terrorist attacks in turkey are also clearly shaken him .
in addition , there is a financial motive .
russia &apos;s economic sanctions have been heavy , especially the ban tilauslennoille which usually take several millions of venäläisturisteja the turkish coast each year .
the number has fallen by almost 90 % .
russia , the local tour operators and tilauslentoyhtiöt will surely be relieved when flights are continuing at the end .
they are hoping for a late seasonal rush to the mediterranean .
and , as early as this week , state tv has predicted a cheaper fruit and vegetables , after the agricultural imports from turkey , once again , is allowed .
“ turistit there , tomatoes back here , &quot; such as the newspaper vedemosti formulated in the report .
but the visit was also a political value in moscow .
ankara is angry at the west for what is considered to be the weak yritettyyn in response to the coup .
when it will be added to the resentment at a snail &apos;s pace , which lasted for a long time edenneistä the eu-our comes out , mr putin , who is eager to take advantage of the viileyttä and murentamaan turkey &apos;s ties with the west .
the russian leader certainly got points ankaralta where he phoned after supporting in support of the designated authorities .
of course , this is a foregone conclusion for moscow , which has its own deep-rooted in fear of their election victory .
so this meeting prameassa merenrantapalatsissa made it possible for russia and turkey &apos;s presentation of the &quot; outsiders &quot; of the coalition , as one analyst described the situation to me : two of the land in the west , who feel abandoned by them and have treated them wrong , joining forces .
these two , however , is the major differences in spite of the public reconciliation .
avainongelma is syria , where moscow has recently tried to reconcile themselves to the role of peace , but russia and turkey , which support opposing sides .
it may be significant that nearly three hours after the initial discussions , presidents have told the press that they were not even touched on the issue .
turkey &apos;s president of deliberately avoided answering a question in the context of their erimielisyyksiinsä , while putin chose the emphasis is being placed on them .
there is not a clear understanding of where they will be able to find common ground with regard to syria .
after months of open hostility , and given the opportunity to the full extent of the disaster in the nato member turkey ampuessa down russian combat aircraft , it is surely better , that the two leaders are , once again , even to keep talking .
the royal bank of scotland lost the scottish from external customers
the bank , according to the chief executive of rbs-branding -rooliin cut in the back office .
the royal bank of scotland lost the scottish from external customers .
ross mcewan , rbs scotlandille has told the bbc that the branding was related to the bank &apos;s international ambitions .
then , when the bank nearly collapsed eight years ago , and it had to save , it has given up on these objectives .
the bank &apos;s strategists have used this time to protect other rbs &apos; tavallista &apos; tavallista -tuotemerkkiä kuluttajarahoitusbrändejä .
it was supported by the millions of pounds spent on international sport sponsorship , the six nations -rugbysta the wimbledon champion andy murrayhin .
but it is now considered to be right to give kansallisempien brändien to come to the fore .
the royal bank of scotland is in place with the scottish customers , but it will not start again from the beginning .
in england and wales , all references to the rbs-päätoimistoa natwestiksi pörssilistauksia and , apart from the changes .
ulster bank -brändi is already in place in ireland and northern ireland to the customers .
there are other , smaller yksityispankkitoiminnan brändejä who will get more visibility , coutts , adam &amp; co , drummond , and holt &apos;s military bank .
mcewania interviews with customers and staff of the round the inverness shiressa .
he told the bbc : &quot; rbs-scotlandille sijoittajabrändimme will be the brand of our workers and employers , because we are now much more brands bank . &quot;
when the bank itself became a global branding rbs , became a global branding .
so i would say that there is no longer a global goals , we have a local targets .
each of these brändeistä means something very different in their own communities , and our staff will work with clients of these brändien below .
rbs has already stated that it will not proceed with the six nations sponsorship , and it has raised the profile of the various brändien urheilusponsoroinnissaan .
&quot; it is now time to move in the direction of brändien 2001free because , in essence , ( we asked ) , it is a question of how we can focus on to make this a better bank for customers , &quot; ceo said .
three years ago , i would have been a very cynical , if we would have said that we are going to be a great bank for customers and offered these brändejä .
but , as a result of the work of what we have focused on the needs of the customer , not ours , i think that you will see a lot of changes .
we can bring those brands back , so i believe that the time is right .

esikuntapäällikkö sergei ivanov , russia &apos;s putin dismissed
russian president vladimir putin has suddenly sacked esikuntapäällikkö sergei ivanov .
mr ivanov has been part of putin &apos;s luotettua-crowd for many years .
63 years old , has now been appointed special representative for the environment and transport .
in the opinion of the kremlin said that putin has &quot; ordered to move away from mr ivanov , the leader of the russian presidential administration tasks &quot; , but this has not been worth it .
mr ivanov , the deputy director from 2012 onwards , anton vaino , has been named his successor .
vaino , 44 , is a former diplomat .
he was born in tallinn , the estonian capital , in 2012 , graduated from the prestigious moscow state institute of international relations ( mgimo ) and was -instituutista embassy in tokyo .
later , he led the president &apos;s protokolla- and hallitushenkilökuntaa , says the kremlin &apos;s website ( in russian ) .
when he was appointed , mr putin , he said : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
i think that the administration &apos;s main task is to support your efforts , head of state , what will be the draft laws , as well as the implementation of the ohjeistuksienne under control .
mr putin told russian tv station on friday that ivanov was asked to leave her place and recommended that the persecution appointed in his place .
are hymyt convincing ?
this is a movement that has stirred up moscow .
sergei ivanov has long been one of vladimir putin &apos;s closest allies , and , as mr putin , the function of the soviet security service in the kgb .
esikuntapäällikkönä he was one of the country &apos;s most influential men .
the state television showing the meeting with putin , the two men argued that esikuntapäällikkö withdrew from the pages of their own , on request .
but despite hymyilystä kameroille , only a few people here are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
in other words , whether this is just the kind of power struggle between jälkimaininki ?
no one does not yet know .
but the official claim that the man , which , once again , to publicise potential as a presidential candidate , all of a sudden , wants to lead russia &apos;s environmental policy , has been received very sceptical .
the kremlin &apos;s website lainatuissa his comments , mr putin , mr ivanov said &quot; it is true that early in the year 2012 , i asked you to give to the debate over the four years of this very complex , even say the laborious task .
well , i have now been esikuntapäällikkö for four years and eight months . &quot;
mr ivanov accepted the role in december 2011 .
he was deputy prime minister in the past , and the defence minister .
he is a member of the security council and a former member of the russian state security service in the kgb , as well as those of mr putin .
the end of the 1990s , when putin was the head of the state security service fsb , which replaced the kgb , ivanov was appointed to his varajohtajakseen .
when putin came to power , he said mr ivanov as one of five people , to which he trusted most .
once , it was thought that the ivanovista could become russia &apos;s president putin , because putin since the end of the second period of the third season would have been in breach of the constitution .
this task , however , went to another putin &apos;s close ally , dmitry medvedev .
putin became prime minister , before his return as president only three and a half years later .

insinöörit have joined , as well as the crossing of the pyrenees in queensferryn pohjoiskannen maasillan , which means that the bridge now extends fifeen .
it is the first of the four sulusta &apos; kansiviuhkojen &apos; , which are now being completed the bridge around each of the three pillar .
siltaosuus fifesta is now the 600 metres long and weighs 30 000 tonnes .

the bridge , in spite of the enormous size and weight of maasillan and siltakannen between the finalisation of the platform is a delicate operation , with extreme accurate sizes will be compatible .
overall , nearly 79 % siltakannesta is now in place , and in the last part is being cast betonikansi rosythissa today , which means that the whole lid is ready to increase this to their seats sillalle .
michael martin , the fort crossing bridge constructors , head of the project , said : &quot; the first released anywhere siltaprojektissa is always an important milestone .
in this fantastisessa project this rakennustekniikan represents the top of the bar .
when the final tiekannen the proportion was installed and connected to the growing pohjoispylvään tiekanteen , we had to shut down after the remaining part of the interior as set out in the north , in other words , to the side .
this was done by pulling on the northern corridor maasiltaa 700 mm in a southerly direction .
this was a huge and at the same time very demanding measure .
the huge , because the viaduct has 222 metres long , weighs around 6000 tonnes and had to drag around 3 % kaltevuuskulmassa .
obsessive-compulsive , because the permitted mittapoikkeamat , according to which the team worked , were pikkuruisia , only a few millimetrejä in both directions .
fortunately , however , it all went well .

three of the men are &quot; lucky &quot; when he was alive after they fell off kalastusveneestään angleseyn .
moelfre rnli -pelastusveneasema did the alarm at 1.20 p.m. ( bst ) on friday , after the crew saw the event evolving moelfre bay -lahdella .

pokémon go is a respectable the health and happiness of hunting
it is fascinating to see how the world is changing .
over the past decade , many have murehtineet the fact that teenagers and children are no longer go out of play , but that they prefer to spend their leisure time sound evidence by looking .
pokémon go prompts people to stand up and take part in one of the daily activities .
näyttöaika was originally on the television , video games , then and now , in recent times , the smart phones .
it is wonderful to see that the technologybrazil10 and ulkoilma-activity are not mutually exclusive .
i am referring , of course , to villitykseen called pokémon go . sovellukseen , which is based on the hahmoihin , which originally was developed in the 1990s , was born in video games ( later the animated cartoon , pelikortit and other jatkotuotteita ) .
like many of the pop culture phenomena , its popularity was somewhat diluted before the publication of this new game in the united states , australia and new zealand in the early hours of july .
since then , the game was delayed publication in other countries , because of the huge popularity ylikuormitti servers .
only days of pokémon golla was users more than tinderillä and almost as much as the twitterillä .
how does it work ?
in a nutshell , the players are in search of a selitettynä älypuhelimiaan pokémoneja which traced gps , and who , in the wake of the discovery could be &quot; against &quot; ( ruutukaappauksen ) or on the phone with the help of the “ captured ” .
generation , who played the game at an earlier age , has joined the kink in villitykseen and etsintöihin according to their daily .
in the united states , the game has led to a significant increase in &quot; keskivertohenkilön &quot; daily askelissa .
apple watch app for cardiogram , which will be followed by 35 000 users , recently told the washington post that , within two days of the publication of the game for 30 minutes a day , the number of people moving from 45 % to 53 % hyppäsi cardiogramin seuraamissa käyttäjissä .
the company does not know who is playing pokémon gota , it only sees harjoittelutasotiedot .
many public terveyskampanjoiden calls &quot; to find 30 &quot; , &quot; rising daily &quot; and &quot; not an active every day , &quot; have not produced any results , on the grounds that the vast majority of the public is tedious terveysvaroituksista and they care about the people who seem to be onnettomilta .
the importance of exercise is not , however , cannot be ignored .
regularly mobile is a lower risk of developing cancer or depression .
thermodynamic activity to help painonhallinnassa , high blood pressure and diabetes . its interests are too complex to read out here .
pokémon gon hienous is that it gets people to go out and do something for which they enjoy .
this will be covered by the three pillars of health : exercise , fresh air and sunshine , as well as hauskuus .
some people even get metsästäessään to make new friends .
as usually , resent this ilonpilaajat are looking for things to complain about .
yes , someone will be able to walk in the door .
and then ?
it has been a breakthrough .
while in the past was fitbitin such applications , which made it possible to monitor the activity , they are not allowed to be movement in the same way as this game .
uutuudenviehätys will disappear and the use of diminishing in due course .
pokémonin will , however , because of the success of the other games , which unite applications and virtual reality responds to take an active role in honouring metsästäviä many of the people to be more active , better shape and healthier .

simone biles gold in women &apos;s voimistelun moniottelussa nappasi
unohda the pressures .
. unohda julkisuuskohu
simone biles is immune to it all .
. energinen hypyissä
smooth puomilla .
an incredible the pit of .
a shining everywhere .
and now , finally , our olympic winner . &quot;
19-year-old american voimistelija reached moniottelun mastery over on thursday , leaving the gap between themselves and the loppumaailman raised the issue in the spotlight of the olympic games .
he kokonaispisteensä , 62.198 , were clearly the better , than hopeamitalistin and &quot; final five &quot; -joukkuetoveri prince aly raismanin and the russian pronssimitalisti mustafinan aliya .
american simone biles tasapainopuomilla women &apos;s artistic gymnastics moniottelun individuals &apos; final at the 2016 rio de janeiro , brazil on thursday .
bilesista became the fourth american woman , who has won the peräkkäisesti moniottelun mastery over , and , on the whole , v--5th amerikkalaismestari . at the same time , he reinforced his reputation of their generation , and , perhaps , is the best of all time .
he broke out in tears when his finaalipisteensä was announced , and his long journey towards this moment was closed .
this achievement to raise her in the same category as other generation with the best athletes , such as michael phelpsin , who have increased the survival of the human species to a new level :
biles has dominated for the past three years , winning 15 of its kind in maailmanmestaruusmitalia , including 10 gold , programmes , whose ambition and precision of the mixture has been so amazing that the 1984 olympiamestari mary lou retton called him &quot; the best näkemäkseni voimistelijaksi . &quot;
the final test in brazil , looked forward to the competition , which was not so much the biles and other competitors , but between him and ylisuurien between the burden of expectations .
a return to the family home in texas springiin without a handful of gold medals , it would have been a disappointment .
american simone biles , left , and prince aly raisman halaavat after winning a gold and hopeamitalin ( in that order ) , the women &apos;s artistic gymnastics moniottelun individuals final at the 2016 rio de janeiro , brazil , thursday , elok .
biles won the first coin on tuesday , when he was eläköityvän as the pinnacle of the national team coordinator martha karolyin , lähtöjuhlissa .
while biles claimed that he had never thought about the future to tread the path to the top of a long , it is not entirely true .
some of his permanto-programme - which includes his tavaramerkkinsä volttiohitus latinalaisamerikkalaiseen - has been adapted to the music , which would fit perfectly , but also on the street beside the rio olympialaisareenan .
this is not a coincidence .
that girl whose his old parents adopting taaperona , and whose coach aimee boormanin mother found , when the girl was on an investigative trip salilla where boorman valmensi , has become a powerhouse .
he has not lost since the summer of 2013 , moniottelussa voittoputki and this is likely to continue as long as the biles wants .
while mustafina was at the head of a small , after two rounds , it was just an illusion .
tasapainopuomi and permanto where biles is the dominant world champion , had expected .
he rose to the top of the 15.433 puomipisteillä and exceeded the 15.933 through the pit .
raisman hugged him gently when they were expecting loppupisteitä - a mere formality - and the tears came bilesin glitterpunaisella , white and blue defined in the eye when the myth , which he once wrote leikekirjaansa , came true .
raismanin performance was touting a kind of four years ago , when he was divided in third place , but lost the pronssin mustafinalle uusinnassa .
at the time , a 22-year-old joukkueenjohtaja , which the americans call &quot; isoäidiksi , &quot; was clearly winning .
he sent a letter to the public permantosuorituksensa lentosuukkoja after the return of emotion , which at times seemed questionable .

why do we need , and laurieta simonea gabbya
so this year at the invitation of the women &apos;s olympic voimistelujoukkuetta , for more than one reason .
first of all , i have been in every olympics at the since 1984 , and the us has never been so dominant .
and secondly : in this team is involved in three voimistelijaa , simone biles , gabby douglas , laurie hernandez and lauren &apos; &apos; , which are coloured inspiroineet many of the girls .
the composition of the team , which the jewish prince aly raisman and madison kocian catholic complement , not all proud .
this team seems to be , at long last , america .
it has also established a tummaihoisten and the latin american presence of women at the top of the species .
in the last four years , the most successful naisvoimistelija has been an african american .
last year , simone and gabby were the first and second .
this is a fantastic .

on thursday simonesta became the fourth american woman , who has won the women &apos;s peräkkäisesti yksilökultaa moniottelussa .
and joukkuetoveri prince aly raisman won the silver .
we see the top of the species , but the situation does not seem to be in this voimistelusaleissa in different parts of the country .
simone , gabby and laurie chose to take all the same path , as prince aly and olympiajoukkueen in madison , wisconsin .
they are the &quot; final five &quot; ( for the past five ) , because the next olympics voimistelujoukkueessa will be one of only four voimistelijaa karolyin marta , and this is the last year of the coach .
the reality , however , is that the gymnastics is an expensive species , and , as a rule , and junior voimistelijat private voimisteluklubeissa which maintain the parents , who are paying for coaching , facilities , trips , univormut , kilpailumaksut , hotellimaksut voimistelijoilleen valmentajille ( and their families ) , and the list goes on .
a large proportion of these voimisteluklubeista are located in more affluent esikaupunkinaapurustoalueilla , who will be able to support the species .
these clubs voimistelijat will receive all valmennuksensa and this is an expensive and long-term commitment voimistelijoiden families .
aimee boorman , simone bilesin the coach , and the coach maggie haney , laurie hernandez , are both nurtured urheilijoitaan since they began their voimistelun .
we will bring more affordable and accessible voimisteluvalmennusta who live in the communities where simonen , gabbyn and laurien innostamat many young girls .
during the voimistelusäätiöni 20 years ago .
järjestöissäni we have offered to express and cheap voimistelua harlemissa more than 15 000 kaupunkilaisnuorelle ( mainly black and latinoille ) and we have nurtured the national and international champions .
in september , we extend to detroit ( my hometown ) in order to provide a high level of voimistelua young people , who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this significant olympialaislajista .
voimistelijat develop body strength , flexibility and coordination , as well as in the minds of the hard work , discipline and determination .
this combination offers facing lifelong benefits in good health , as well as the school and työmenestykselle .
this team will be the inspiration for thousands of young girls start voimistelun and it is fantastic .
sport participation is so important , especially for girls .
we are living in an exciting time .

when the time before the first group of doctors will be transferred to the new agreement , there are only eight weeks , progress must be made , and time is running out .

this , despite the fact that jeremy huntin promise last month that his door is always open .
&quot; jeremy huntin should act now to remove the pressures and to take into account the concerns of junior doctors .
if he fails to do so , the junior doctors are willing to continue työtaistelutoimia .

mortimer said : “ työtaisteluilla there will be very little or nothing , but they will put pressure on the already difficult situation for the teams and services , as well as a cause for concern , the distress and disruption to patients , huolenpitäjille and their families . &quot;
over the past two months , we have been discussing the junior doctors committee , together with the committee and the ministry of health and with others , have responded positively to their concerns regarding the role of control ( the guardian role ) and whistleblowing ( whistleblowing ) .
employers were hopeful that the continued positive debate on other important issues - such as the development of education and training , flexibility , sapattivapaalta returning of in-service training , education expenses , the curriculum , the mutual recognition of opintovapaasta as well as the gender pay gap in medicine - is a sign of how seriously the employers , health education england -koulutusjärjestö and the ministry of health in november , february and may with the bma &apos;s respect for the agreements achieved .

if you are a tourist ian wright nuoleskelee the dirtiest places for matkaopasta

suffolkista from the presenter and matkakirjoittaja ian wright , 51 , of euro banknotes , piccadilly nuolaisi kaidetta circuksessa vessan huuhtelupainiketta , the train , as well as the russian public telephones to prove immune system strength .
before each site fotometriä nuolaisemista he used as an opportunity to show themselves and to us the situation , to which he was going to occur .
the experiment , which was turned into a film called the internal force on the track , however , produced surprising results .
the idea of a train used by thousands of people huuhtelupainikkeen nuolaisemisesta may seem entirely of revolt , but , in fact , the kitchen lavuaarissa is more bad bacteria .
on its way through europe , wright spoke about the constant doctors and medical professionals suolistobakteerien and his own health .
fortunately , none of his nuolemansa has left him with the rest of a bad taste in the mouth .
wrightista suolistonsa testaajana the sustainability of became known for her to travel around the world and eating strange and wondrous things .
this kaiteista railway stations in the public toilet seat huuhtelupainikkeeseen arm to be truly tested his immuunijärjestelmäänsä .
the film , he said : &apos; &apos; lapsesta since , i have been relatively free from worries about their health , and i put in my mouth , worms and all sorts of things mullasta kuraisesta from the water . &quot;
he really has confirmed its reputation during the course of the film .
the only thing , which he refused to do , was saastainen the russian public rest .
his näytteessään fotometrissä was more than 4000 unit , the figure .
by way of comparison , the mileage vastapestyjen hands should be less than 60 .
but in one of the russian public käymälässä he refused nuolaisemaan when fotometrin seemed to be the result of more than 4000 units , and the result is less than 60 vastapestyjen hands .
wright has produced the film , the internal strength of the tourist track , together with the finnish meijer , valion . the film bakteerimäärä seems to be in different places , such as kylpyhuoneessa .
the film carbon monoxide , said : &quot; this is almost the worst thing that i am haistanut the rest . &quot;
there is nothing in the dirtier !
i am not going to count our chickens anything , because here is yököttävää .
the internal strength track was produced by the finnish valion , meijer , together with the .
the company offered wrightille valio gefilusta , which includes maitohappobakteereja as well as vitamins c and d , which will help to improve people ’ s suolistobakteereja and the immune system .
valion snacks , and the leader of the new categories to niko vuorenmaa said : &quot; we wanted to really give consumers something new .
something that would be fascinating to watch , and at the same time , which would explain probioottien interests .
heittelimme the air a lot of crazy ideas , and we came up with the idea of the &apos; tavallista soitetaanpa ianille &apos; . &quot;
they claim that the interest in the health of suoliston is becoming a global phenomenon .
but instead of just talking about products , we wanted to give them greater context : to tell the everyday environment of good and bad bacteria , the importance of suolistoterveyden and the link with the immune system .
the growing interest in the health of suoliston is a global phenomenon , and this made a documentary film can help us in an interesting way to tell more about it to consumers .
i think that the documentary also shows that we have a wonderful sense of humour !
dokumentin director tom hakala , added : &quot; whatever might be said about it now , even though it this way : if ian had licked off some of the things that i asked him , as in the film has given its yököttävää russian toilet , i would have lost my respect for him . &quot;
understandably , part of the nuoltavista things were easier ianille , while part of it was quite difficult .
i am glad that we got some of those dirty nuolaisuista stores . &quot;

vinyylin destination : who is going to buy a dvd ?
yksinäiset , middle aged men love vinyyleitä . &quot;
before ryntäät ärtyneillä kommenttiosion to meet the violation , which is co-nimimerkki eikaikkiyksinäisetkeski ikäisetmiehet , you see that this claim is based on real data .
according to yougovin the much talked about the emergence of a new discs is not due to the fact that an increasing number of people born this millennium enthused by the physical objects , but the average age of uutuudenviehätyksestä kaihosta .
apparently , those who have bought vinyylilevyn in the near future , are the most likely to 45 to 54 years old .
in fact , all of the likely to buy a dvd of 18 to 24 year age group belong .
it is not just the players , but it includes keräilystä tunnemerkitystä : parents vinyylien buyers are slightly more likely to evoke feelings ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) , and enjoy the feeling of abandonment ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but yougovin whether or not the results of the true ?
if this blog would be followed by a camera in front of the television news reports but , for me , when i travel in the middle of a busy street , sohossa there with my modest grey suits . viittoilisin a lively discussion before pysähtyisin , muodostaisin a cup to go away and i would say something about an authoritative , such as : &quot; tutkitaanpa the issue in more detail . &quot;
tutkitaanpa in more detail .
at the same time , when the sohon charm to remove dirt and slowly - hotels , ketjuravintolat and -kaupat and toimistotarvikeliikkeet now meet the buildings , which in the past was the movements of the self - a handful of fantastic specialised levykauppoja is still remaining .
for the next section for the camera , i would probably put an end to describe the moment when i stand very close to a variety of men in some of these deals in trying to assess their age havainnoimalla and tunnetemperamenttiaan .
glasgowlainen stuart , 55 , of which i am watching sister raysta ( laskuri : two young women , three of the middle-aged between men ) reckless recordsiin ( laskuri : eight middle-aged between men , one woman , probably kaksissakymmenissä ) , celebrates iltapäiväänsä in london as a result of the meeting , and fudges kuluttaakseen shops in a few hours .
i ask whether he collector . &quot;
&quot; kai , i am , &quot; he says .
i have around 3000 or 4000 record .
these products , which are reflected in the image above ( he sent a sample of the email , i followed him home ) , cover the walls of his olohuoneensa .
the reason for such a huge flat rolled products and the acquisition of singlemäärän is partly the result of her disposable income : now , he or she will be able to buy the dvd , which he was not in the room when they originally was published , and he will be able to buy them again , which he sold when they are young and rahaton .
&quot; a large part of the late ostamastani the material is in the 1960s and the 1970s , owe a dvd , which was published , when i was 11 or 12 , disks , the acquisition of which i was probably a little bit too young , &quot; he says .
he agrees that the discs , buyers are more likely to be introvertteja who enjoy their own seurastaan , and adds : &quot; i do not smoke or drink too much .
this is my paheeni . &quot;
the 25-year-old wez , who works for the sister rayssa , also believes that many of his customers face yougovin fit the profile .
he has , however , noticed a new wave of people , which has been affected by the enthusiasm of the media . people who have heard that the products have come back in fashion , and which has become the need to buy the old levynsä back .
käymieni on the basis of the discussions hankkiutuneet kokoelmastaan get rid of people who are usually in 1998 or 1999 .
customers who sold vinyylinsä to buy the cd-roms , now selling cd : nsä levynsä in order to buy back , &quot; he says .
this may explain the increase in the number of a certain age vinyyliheränneiden .
but what about the alleged discs tunnemerkitys ?
phonican in a trade , it takes a few seconds to realise that the offer of the community levykaupat lohdullisen samanhenkisille types .
wezin according to the parents of some of the customers have been injured , in particular lähimaksujärjestelmästä .
some vinyylifanit to häkeltyä the digital world and to choose its confidence in the sustainability ; levykansien familiar objects , which are the subject of teenage age onnenpäivien memories .
&quot; i think that sometimes it may be a matter of filling in the gap , or some kind of lohdusta , which creates a &quot; possession of objects , wez says .
i myself keräilijänä i admit that this is true , and i believe it to be true for many people .
it is an easy way to meet the ideas .
&quot; we have as their sosiaalityöntekijöitään ! &quot; another worker said the sudden levypinon do not trust .
huhtikuullinen the poll carried out by icm revealed that nearly 50 % of the people who had bought vinyylilevyn in the last month , had not yet been listening to it .
the survey also found that 41 % of levysoitin is that they will never use , while 7 % vinyyleitä ostavista levysoitinta is not .
at this point uutisraporttia näyttäisin is likely to be worried when i leafed through a serious bossa nova -kokoelmien piles of them .
this is a wake-up call “ prize ” perspective ” is something , which is also the sounds of the universessa ( laskuri : three of the middle-young man who works ) , jonny , 42 , has noticed .
&quot; someone came a short time ago and said : &apos; i am not levysoitinta , but i would like to buy the disk , radiohead , so that we can put it on the shelf &apos; , &quot; he says .
this is not a big proportion , but it definitely is going to happen .
more of the product , less music .
there will be people who will say : &quot; i do not levysoitinta . &apos;
it is , therefore , the parents , but younger people , aged myöhäisteini who have just innostumassa on the issue .
foppissa , which now is almost an entire floor reserved for vinyyleille , is when i arrived in much more diverse audience .
seitsemänkymppisiä couples , the number of tourists taking photos , teinipoikia and the middle-aged women .
although the atmosphere is less than in the past in the shops - rento kaiuttimista raikaa wild beastin latest syntikan- and seksintäyteinen pop , and improvisaatiojazz - it is wonderful to see different types of customers .
none of them seem to be particularly yksinäiseltä , but still the psychological trauma is proving difficult for the next to someone standing by 30 seconds .
elanora , 27 , is around the foppia has walked on a few minutes watching the sale of the different disks .
he is doing ikkunaostoksia , not to spend that much money .
he says that the earning much levykeräily , so it is not really an option .
&quot; it is expensive .
it is easy to listen to music , either through a computer or something else , but vinyylin beauty is ... &quot; he has rakastuneesti .
&quot; i don &apos;t know how to explain - it is a really unique . &quot;
over the past pysähdyspaikkani says vinyylinrakastajien which had attracted a new generation : urban outfitters .
at the same time , when i try , it seems that i studied the farkkushortseja , observations from the group of teenage girls who are rallying around the polaroid cameras for a moment , before the father and daughter are considering the purchase of crosleyn levysoittimen .
on my left is in the wall is adele , jeff buckleyn , amy winehousen and fleetwood mac discs covered with : a mixture of nykymusiikkia and klassikoita , keskivertokokoelman any relevant products .
no one does not see them - perhaps because of the fact that they are only baubles , and some are so high that they koskeminen would be impossible .
it is a purely &quot; taidevinyylit . &apos;
but given that these objects received little attention can mean more money for the industry and to send a few customers sohon depths to find out more , this is not a lot of complaints .
it will come as no surprise that the section of the population , which is more likely to be more time and money , it is also the most , which uses , such as luksusesineisiin vinyyleihin .
but even though löydökseni point to the fact that the results are accurate , at least yougovin sohon levykaupoissa , they do not rule out the possibility of female collectors and vinyylien lovers , there is a large number of tosimaailmassa , levykaupoissa and online forums .
these people are likely to work very hard at school or in the office .
they are certainly are not going to spend around in berwick street torstaiaamujaan maleksimalla levykauppoja selaten disks and evasiveness karmivan , 30-year-old tekotelevisiojuontajan look kurkkiessa this evil-aavistamattomien middle-aged men over the workers .

it is extremely difficult to say why , in turku has been stolen more bicycles than elsewhere .
i have no answer to the question .
&quot; varkauksien frequency can affect how much and how much is in the town of bicycles , in general , is &quot; considering ylikonstaapeli teemu Äikäs .
poliisihallituksen tommi reen must be quite actually arrive , turku , finland , helsinki and oulu are rising to the top of the comparison .
pyörävarkauksien amounts to go to a large extent , depending on what are the study and pyöräilykaupunkeja .
in turku is close by the centre , a short distances and a lot of bicycles available for the thieves .
&quot; for example , espoo , in turn , has quite a different type of city , where the kaupunkikeskukset are far apart , and a bicycle is not necessarily the primary mode of &quot; reen says .
the in finland to the attention of the police is january-august has become a little less pyörävarkauksia than during the same period last year .
the joy , however , is no cause for concern .
over the past years , in spite of the downturn to the attention of the police will be a little more than 20 000 pyörävarkautta each year .
that means a 50-60 fillaria every day , and only in helsinki , the wheel around 4 000 per year .
&quot; they are big quantities of &quot; reen says .
in reality varkaat will take more bicycles , because it is the only part of the victims to inform the theft to the police .
reen urges people to make a complaint pyörävarkaudesta , though fewer than one in ten of the case will be reported to the police .
a typical clarified pyörävarkaus is one in which the police will be informed of the theft , and as soon as the thief is caught verekseltään .
&quot; there is also capable , when , for example , in the context of the rest of the investigation huumejutussa flats can be found in stolen bicycles , &quot; reen says .

u-lock on wheels to give better protection than many other forms of the lock .
some varkaista take the bike , for example , in the short term , for the purpose of the exercise of their own , but a large part of the stolen wheel ends up for sale , for example , via the internet .
they will remain on the domestic market .
&quot; it does not come to the attention of the police , with little in the way of the stolen bicycles to go abroad , &quot; reen says .
stolen bikes buyers are ordinary finns , according to the police .
some of the purchase will be stolen bike without knowing it .
part of it may be the doubts .
of spent bike buyer must be careful , because he cannot commit kätkemisrikokseen or -rikkomukseen .
&quot; hälytyskellojen should sound the alarm if hyväkuntoista a wheel is sold below cost , &quot; reen says .

flow &quot; megalomania is a virtue in the
viihtyvyyden precise criteria and the ambitious visions are established flow festivalin role on the international stage as a major event in the world , which is a distinguished tähdittävät huippuartistit .
flow festival begins on friday in helsinki .
festarikävijät are typically expressed themselves omaleimaisella pukeutumisella .
one of the päälavan bands this year the punk legend iggy pop .
flow festivalin event in the region , among other things , the stailataan tekonurmella and taideinstallaatioilla .
we have never been enough , that would only päälava and kaljateltta , says the event , the artistic director thomas kallio .
the helsinki suvilahdessa flow festival to be held this weekend has grown from a small korttelifestarista event of tens of thousands of visitors .
the key to success is driven by a simple question : what kind of the perpetrators of the event itself would like to go ?
tapahtumatuotannoissa has come from that , in the view of the case .
often the goal is to achieve the level of need for viranomaismääräysten and acting in accordance with the event , says artistic director thomas kallio .
he knew that in the weeks before the event , flow will be by the end of this year to sell .
the aim has been to increase in the last year , 70 000 people kävijämäärää 5 000 people .
festareilla will be seen again this year , a number of interesting domestic and foreign artists .
kävijämäärän growth is a good thing , because to do is in some way to finance .
on the other hand , we do not want to grow up too much , because at some stage mass would be as karjalauma , which are directed to the massive väylissä .
that is not what we do not want to .
due to the ideology of the event is 13 years before us in such a way that , in part , tekonurmella somistetulla in the region is 130 words or fine speeches , as well as a number of taideinstallaatioita ravintolapisteitä and drinkkibaareja .
päälavan and the smaller esiintymislavojen keikkapaikkana this year , in addition to the 15 000 people tent .
kallio admitted that the event could take more straightforward way .
maybe i am a little megalomaniac , but at the same time we have been able to maintain the flow &apos; n &apos; lives at risk .
if it loses , this is no longer our story .
kalliolle the greatest pleasure and reward for their work is that , today , large visions are practically possible .
the event in the early years of the 21st century , in the middle of the action was very dependent on the city of helsinki around 20 000 euro for their support .
last year , the flow for pyörittävän company had a turnover of around six million euros .
it may help to bring about a &quot; kreisejäkin stories about the &quot; , such as that of 73 metres wide tent housing developments .
flow &quot; n visitors are typically expressed themselves omaleimaisella pukeutumisella .
musiikkitapahtuman alongside trendikkäiden can speak to young adults in the community .
the event , however , is not deliberately left his muodikkaaksi particularly .
we want to distinguish itself , above all , the content .
but also fashion-phenomena are suitable for flow &apos; n the catalogue : uteliaisuuteen and the desire to vuorovaikuttaa with the environment , says kallio .
this year , one of the bands is päälavan punkin legend , a 69-year-old iggy pop .
miehellä is in their own genressään a huge fanijoukko but he indierockia , pop-music , which received four djs - 20syl yhdistelevällä räppiä and it is not the most typical personality .
according to kallio iggy buukattiin , because it is now likely to be the last time that this is seen as keikalla in finland .
we are interested in the history of all of them , and the future .
it is just what the commercial radio .
iggyn the latest record is a damn good and he has done in recent years in the bloody good keikkoja .

ekonomistikunnan believes that voters did not believe the economic arguments , because economists &apos; consensus does not become sufficiently addressed .
they kismitti in particular , the bbc impartiality , who gave as much room for only one or two per cent of the eu-ekonomistikunnasta representing the difference between pro-taloustieteilijöille as the majority .
eu-hostile press did not bother to tell you what the ifs , ifm , boe , cepr and the lse and the rest of the economy , the consequences are mahtikirjainyhdistelmät the difference .
those include the kirjainyhdistelmät kasvottomasti spoke about economic growth , trade relations , sovereign debt and currency .
and if economists messages and listened to them , so that it is not unheard of , because economists represent the kind of elite , with whom voters felt that it did not have common interests .
ekonomistien in large cities , such as academic would be yes , remained in the eu , but in small towns and rural areas the message is starting to bear fruit .
maahanmuuttokin is the economy
the brexit vote overwhelming voittoargumentti was on the issue of immigration .
maahanmuuttaja takes työpaikkasi sairaalasi clogs , an immigrant , an immigrant to take advantage of you .
these are the arguments of smart .
every mounted on a café is foreign workers .
how much more jobs in the british would be if they left out ?
every primary care centres , waiting to join sees immigrants .
how much easier to get a briton lääkäriaikoja if they would not be ?
each school is maahanmuuttajienkin children .
how much easier access to the children of the briton saisivatkaan koulupaikan if they get rid of it ?
each municipality is home to foreigners .
how much more room for alkuasukkailla it would be if they häipyisivät ?
i think that these are the economic issues .
they the jobs , housing and public services .
economists , however , are not able to respond to them and if we were able , their responses do not have visibility .
economists have failed to explain that , thanks to the migrants in the british have more and more jobs , less terveyskeskusjonoja and more money for education and social security .
migrants - and , in particular , the eu migrants - are net contributors to the british public finances and their consumption creates jobs .
aberdeen kiinteistörahasto brexitiin had , in cash
one of the funds was aberdeen asset management , which is responsible for the finnish mr pertti vanhanen . ’
he says that in aberdeen at the time by the brexitiin a and b-plans .
the plan b , in other words , the eu will be the difference between victory of the camp began to prepare for more a few weeks before the vote , in the event that the outcome would leave .
the worry was that investors begin to pull their money out of the market .
kiinteistörahastoilla does not normally not massive liquid funds , but now they might be necessary .
läksimme to raise cash .
when the brexit happened on 23 days , there was a 25 per cent of the fund &apos;s investment funds käteis- or likvideissä , vanhanen says aberdeen only open on a daily basis noteerattavasti kiinteistörahastosta , which were in the news .
according to mr vanhanen normaalitaso would be 15 to 20 % .
the fund was worth £ 3.5 billion at the time .
a total of the company &apos;s funds is worth around £ 20 billion .
it was the highest number of nine in the open kiinteistörahastossa , vanhanen says all of the outstanding british kiinteistörahastojen kiinteistörahastoista .
he estimates that the lowest käteismäärä these funds fell 10 % , or even less .
so kiinteistörahastot varautuivat brexitiin a very different strategies .
they turned trade
when the eu-difference between a profitable camp won , europe went up to the roof .
kiinteistömarkkinoilla the vote followed less than two weeks , however , were very peaceful , vanhanen says .
then there were two things that have changed the situation .
the first was the director general of the bank of england , mark carneyn speech , in which he estimates that brexit could be commercial kiinteistötoimijoille a big risk .
in addition , the kiinteistörahastoista the first , standard life , froze the haggling .
these ryöpäyttivät , together with the situation and has raised the issue of the financial times and the bbc grab .
this was compared with as soon as the years 2007 and 2008 , vanhanen says .
this prompted investors hermostumaan .
institutional investors remained rauhallisempina , but private investors hermoilivat .
snowball began to turn , and the fund after another was forced to close their doors .
aberdeen , the situation was a good collected as a result of the cash , but it had happened , and , in the end , to freeze for six days .
vanhanen , they are not actually closed the trade , but changed the pricing downwards .
in practice , he said , investors were given time to consider whether it is worth the money now to pull out of the panic .
aberdeen message was that , if you do not have now forced to take rahojanne out , it does not support , because it would lead to losses .
it were reassured by the situation , and , for the most part , withdrew his announcement .
since then , have been fairly steady , and now the market has been in a couple of weeks in a very calm , vanhanen says .
he points out , for example , that the aberdeen continental european funds have not had any similar upheaval .
kyselyitä came , however , a lot .
kiinteistörahastoille kohtuuttomasti attention
vanhanen kaupankäyntien kiinteistörahastojen believes that the closures were a disproportionate amount of attention .
open the funds , which are related to the closures , dominated by around four per cent of the british buildings .
aberdeen bar has lasted for six days , and the company sold out in less than ten properties , 80 % of gdp , located in london kiinteistöstään .
some of the other funds are still caught .
aviva investors warned its investors this week that it may be the funds to the side of the 2017 .
at the moment , there is a lot of uncertainty , and economic growth forecasts reivattu is down , but the situation does not seem to be in aberdeen hurjemmalta &quot; . &quot;
the main issues for the future development of the national economy , now in the british .
it is , despite the fact that the situation has brought the majority of kiinteistösijoittajista even the new opportunities , vanhanen points out .
owing to the depreciation of the dollar and the rate is at its lowest level in 30 years , and , in addition , the market is a 15 % sales provide the time before the brexit vote .
dollariostaja will now be able to buy the same property by up to 30 % cheaper .
halukkaita there are a lot of buyers , vanhanen says .
brexit brought miinuksia in the london property market
2 a.m. in the morning , the situation has not appeared yet very kummoiselta .
but the four , when britannialaisen kiinteistörahaston aberdeen asset managementin ’ , mr pertti vanhanen arose again to see the results of the brexit vote , the situation was different .
voimasanahan it reached .
tajusin that this is all going now to plan b ’ s side , vanhanen says the second homes in helsinki .
he gun straight to work .
the city of london was already fully alive - despite the .
toimistolla normally äänettömiksi laid down by the tv screens tuuttasivat news , and usually vocal hiljentyi entirely to listen to the people , when prime minister david cameron came in the morning in front of the camera to tell erostaan .
when the market aukesivat , näyttöpäätteet vilkkuivat pure red .
it was one in the morning , which would never have believed to be living , vanhanen says .
it is not because the turmoil , in spite of aberdeen , one of britain &apos;s biggest kiinteistörahastoista , was putting the final touches on the day after the brexit vote , juhannuksena the purchase of the two .
the atmosphere was confused .
yhtiössä was , however , an alternative provision has been made for very well , and that is why , in a way , the situation was calm , vanhanen says .
of the brexit vote began correction
the vote was followed by the storm .
the pound fell , the british leadership went to the exchange .
the markets began to anticipate drastic bills in the british and , in particular , of the london property market .
in london , had been anticipated in miinuksia up to 20 % in the coming years .
soon , a number of british kiinteistörahastoja began to freeze happened , one after the other .
aberdeenkin did so for six days .
now myräkkä has subsided , but the uncertainty jyllää still up in the air .
it does not , however , appear in the final kesälomapäiviään have spent this week in helsinki , mr vanhanen faces .
he believes that it is still too early to say much about what the brexitistä will follow .
so much is still open : how the difference is going to happen and how scotland &apos;s response to the situation around , for example .
of the london property market development has already been ensitietoja .
kiinteistöalan palveluyhtiön cbre &apos;s data the trend will cover roughly a third of markkinasta .
they say that all of the london property prices fell by 3.3 per cent from june to july .
short in the city of london toimistorakennuksissa minus 6.1 % , vanhanen lists .
the figures are not so terrible , but they are kuukausimuutoksia .
kuukausittaista index was first published in 1987 , and only five months , there has been worse figures , vanhanen says .
all kriisivuosiin they were one of the big reductions in 2007 and 2008 .
it is interesting because brexitiä compared to the very quickly in the fall of lehman kiinteistömarkkinoilta and the united states since the global financial crisis .
vanhanen believes that the comparison is not entirely apt , because now it is the british kotikutoinen the crisis .
tunnelmakin is the second .
kiinteistömarkkinoilla is now not been seen at that time paniikkimyyntiä but a willingness to sell in order to improve the liquidity , vanhanen says .
rahoitustakin can be found in normally .
korjausliike could have been in any case , in the face of
in fact , the price correction is not about him , it could have been a miracle - ahead without brexitiäkin .
aberdeen , according to an estimate of london and the rest of the world ykköskaupunkien real estate prices have been too high for many years .
we have been saying for the past two years , the city and , in particular , the offices are over-priced , vanhanen says .
the drop , then began with a really high .
the london prices have shot up upwards for four reasons , vanhanen list .
in the british economy has grown strongly , london &apos;s population as well .
another big trend is that the real estate are the last omistusluokka which globalisation , vanhanen says .
in the middle east and asia has become the new players in the market , and a growing number of institutions and private investors are looking for kiinteistösijoituskohteita from abroad .
london is a city an easy target .
in addition , the price has fed a low level of interest rates , which is why , for example , the pension firms have been forced to seek profits from the new sites .
the on loan has been readily available - although velkavipua has been used , according to mr vanhanen now clearly less than the 2008 crisis during the pre buumin .
hajauttakaa hajauttakaa ,
the rise in prices in london tasautui last summer , vanhanen says .
aberdeenkin began to lighten the omistuksiaan in london , and it was the last year nettomyyjä .
there was some sort of a turning point , and now it came .
what this forward ?
it will depend on how the economy evolves , the british , vanhanen says .
paljoa he is not afraid of the future to assess , but says that any nousupiikkiä hardly is in the pipeline .
the atmosphere is referring to the fact that there is a steady downward or in his diary .
vanhanen has already seen a number of moves up and down , because he has been in the real estate industry since 1988 .
and still he is an optimist who believes that the kuopista to get to grips with work .
if you are well prepared for the risks , it is in a better position .
he believes the global decentralisation .
if you have placed in one of the markets , it is too much of its victim .
if there is a decentralised , the risks are also a decentralized , vanhanen says .

britain is organised by the presiding over the gold rugbyhopeaan fidin mestarikurssin
britain &apos;s impressive progress rugbyturnauksessa collapsed in fiji to present a challenge to the very last thursday night &apos;s final , when the team went through 43-7 murskatappion deodoron in the stadium here in rio .
fiji held mestarikurssin reading , puruissa , väistöissä , tukipelissä , juoksulinjoissa and voittaessaan in the transfer of gold - their first olympiamitalinsa .
tappion became involved in reasonable comfort hopeamitalista - britain &apos;s third - and they had to be proud of the hard work of the olympic rugby aloitusturnauksessa , in which they won the new zealand , argentina and south africa .
earlier on the same day pelatun semifinaalin a 7-5 victory over south africa could affect them in the final .
but , despite this , fidi would be in this condition won even though 15 huippukuntoisen the spirit of the team .
great britain can perhaps - but probably not - take comfort in the fact that at least one britillä is tomorrow , wears the gold medal : fidin päävalmentaja is ben ryan , the former england boss wimbledonista .
great britain has been quite a way to go .
eight years ago , they have lost every game valmentamana ryan turnauksessa adelaide .
here , they have lost only one .
that erotic spanking hurts , but the development is striking .
fidi started well , keeping the british taklauksia for the fun of it .
captain tom mitchell joukkueineen it was as if they had been working on the mobile buses , and maailmanmestarit led to the 5-0 after osea kolinisau crashed kulmauksessa maalialueelle .
when he was four minutes , jerry tuwain the second touchdown maalipotkuun led to the right by .
the 12-0 , and great britain was barely covered the balloon .
mitchell &apos;s brilliant taklaus was stopped by a man-mountain leone nakarawan from the third goal , but it was fidille just used as a delaying tactic .
seven minutes jasa veremalua made a goal in the right corner , and great britain was 17-32.2.282.23 losing out .
nakarawa did once again , the mark of a new start , and he was still more than a minute left in the first half . we ....
since then , vatemo ravouvou crashed through the great british löysistä taklauksista ryntäsi and the federal reserve to make a mark .
maalipotkun tauolle if you dig , the situation was 29-0 .
it just seems to me than fidi rugbya would be born to play , while great britain only opetteli game .
and that is how it really is .
great britain made wholesale changes to put on pause , blocking fidin dam ... the whole four minutes , which was the first puoliaikaan compared with josua tuisova did well , until the goal after an impressive syöttöpelin fidin .
dan norton nappasi great britain a goal and , in doing so , touchdownin kulmauksessa kaventaen and on the edge of the numbers of 36-7 , but the game had long been lost etelämeren saarelaisille , whose supporters , who were waving flags and danced katsomoissa .
it was difficult to be commands admiration fidin riemukasta approach .
viliame mata was at the last minute maalillaan kuorrutus fidin kakussa kuorrutusta , which is not needed .
pilliin vihellettiin fidiläiset , halasivat and great britain fell nurmelle , full of iron .
earlier the same day fidi had left japan semifinaalissa 20-5 , and great britain won the south african tight semifinaalissa , where each took one of the goal - the british maalipotku settled the game .
south africa &apos;s kyle brown took the lead in the first half , but dan norton exceeded maalialueen häikäisevällä jalkatyöllä maalipylväiden and made a goal less than in the second half .
the late taklaus marcus watson , england &apos;s 15-aside-rugby without anthony , secured victory and eventually hopeamitalin .
valmentajan the fight against cancer gave impetus to helen glover and heather stanningin soutuvoittoon
in these games the appalling is not going to be the feelings of gold , and it really means something .
on the first vedosta the last , 220 tough kiskaisua towards the history books , helen glover and heather stanning found right from the golden estacio da lagoalla a deeper meaning .
although they soutivat up to us , the boat had three votes . the coach robin williams , an echo of the presence of all the time , when the second subsequent dual kiisi olympiakultaansa parikilpailussa women - the first british women in the sport &apos;s history books , which amount to do that achievement .
their regarding was perfect , and this was their that voittamattomina appearance , which is also a record .
this is what we see on the surface , the two superb athletes liitämässä joutsenen sulokkuudella , does not fully reflect the nature of the victory .
each soutukullan in the background is a group of generous käsipareja which contribute to gradually to those things that make a difference . and käsipari none have been as vital as the coach , who is 30 months ago syöpädiagnoosin after eläisikö he did not know until today .
as he said , the situation was very close .
i had cancer , virtsarakon leikattavissa , which is one of the issues , and they carried out the surgery .
if they are not cut , it is spreading everywhere .
the situation could have been a pretty bad .
it will change a little bit ajattelutapaasi .
williams received the diagnosis in december 2013 .
kolmikko was fortunate that his treatment was able to start at the beginning of 2014 , when they were outside the period of as little as possible disruption - if it can never used the term in these kinds of situations .
i had to get paid , so i had to get better quickly .
it encouraged me .
i was in the hospital and walked into around the department - 20 , 30 , 50 legs at a time when , they said , a step that would be enough .
so it began .
soutaminen itself is the way to go , but it makes it a little bit bigger .
immediately after the victory in the first couple of thoughts was williams , who had been nervous in the morning , and he had spoken to a little more than usual to try to deal with their own hermostustaan .
stanning , afghanistan on the royal artillery rykmentistä experienced captain , said : &quot; i have been tunneraunio this week , which may be a bit of an overreaction , but it means so much to me . &quot;
it underlines just how important this is to me , how much i and helen , and robin , also , we have been working on .
the last three years have been helenin and robin with the mighty .
without robinia we would not have any , so it is a big thank you to him , he is the best coach in the world .
i could not imagine a better harjoittelukumppania or better valmentajaa .
helen glover and heather stanning has not lost the competition for five years .
a couple of set tough sequence , in which their competitors do not .
even in the last 500 metrilläkin when new zealand and the danish teams began to approach , stanningilla and gloverilla was too much energy in reserve .
we were very caught in an instant .
helen cried &quot; to keep the process , to keep up with the process . &quot;
it is really important to keep control .
we had a good start , and at the same time , have tried to do anything special .
we have been looking for firework parties today , we are just trying to overcome the good soutuun and the contest , and that is what we did .
a couple of wait for a year before deciding on its future .
glover will take part in the next month , weddings , when she gets married on the tv with the explorer steve backshallin .
right now , he wants to just enjoy the moment .
&quot; i did not want to say that this would be the last kilpailuni .
it would put too much pressure on .
the london , it took about six months to realise that i was our olympic winner .
everything was so new and i was so stressed-out .
here , it lasted for about four minutes .
this seems to be so much better , &quot; he said .

the tsunami from the past - the people &apos;s news
the sea myllertää dramatic , but the actual tsunami hits in the middle of madrid katuvilinää - to justify its actions with the past can begin .
that , in a nutshell , pedro almodóvarin innovation at the heart of the story .
the previous ohjaustyö almodovarin matkarakastajat ( 2013 ) was pikkuhauska and ronskinpuoleinen a satirical comedy , its predecessor , the skin i live in ( 2011 ) espanjalaistaiturin career tips .
tasollisesti julieta ( 2016 ) , lies somewhere in between those two copies .
it is the human relations and sovinnaisen seesteinen rakkaus- perhedraama , which is at the heart of the relationship between mother and daughter .
the story is simppeli and is seen as very much a long takaumana .
life seems to be the model in the middle-age nimihenkilön ( emma soares ) , but then all is a threat to the collapsing .
satunnaisen in the aftermath of the meeting of the new miesystävä ( dario grandinetti ) should not be always amazed at the film loppumetreille until now .
takauman and for a long time in their lives , in the form of a letter to the julieta kasvaneelle up stages of her daughter .
he will start the time before the birth of daughter , the moments when we met this future father ( daniel grao ) .
at the same time , another naispääosaan julietaa will rise as a young teacher performing adraina ugarte , tv series of the time between the familiar ommelten ( 2013-2014 ) .
julietan ageing of the population has been conducted in a way that can be considered to be kökkönä but , personally , i would say that time veikeästi and kertapyyhkäisyllä literally .
almodóvar-filmeille often so tunnusomaiseen räiskyvyyteen always humour , julietassa is a fair distance .
it is tasavahvasti näytelty , restrained , and , in places , with good music and quite surumielinen the film , which is an element in the form of elegiaan .
instead of a typical visual espanjalaisohjaajalle värikylläisyys is still , and in such a way that it will begin to slowly stands out more than a pure ardent adherent draamallisena officer .
the film people hit the illnesses , deaths or otherwise , only the sudden losses , but the area remains one of the koreana .
this is especially true in the case of change : nimihenkilön puvustukseen kohtauksesta you are residing in the second , and the same is true for apparently identical korviksiin .
almodóvar in these matters is accurate , but the main thing , in other words , a current viritelmät does this not improve .
mekaanisesti repetitive nature is the impression ulkokohtainen and a little uninspiring .
almodóvar has made the script nobelilla 2013 , canadian literature prize winner alice munron novellin on the basis of the three .
novellit karkulainen : there has been published in the &apos; .
almodóvar has invested in the dialogue , the result is a little bit tasapaksun written kirjallisuusfilmatisointi .
aineksia would have been emotionally incomparably jykevämpäänkin drama , the big issues - especially the gnawing guilt - leffan tematiikka is dealing with .
guidance and the script : pedro almodóvar .
based on alice munron three novelliin .
pääosissa : emma soares , adriana ugarte , rossy de palma , daniel grao , dario grandinetti .

the government is trying to vaalikikkaa - people &apos;s news
the new cuts will not do , keep telling ministers , so that the finns party are not totally collapse .
in the spring , decided , however , will be a raft of cuts .
the new cuts will not be .
for the four billion in savings are sufficient .
this can convince the prime minister juha sipilä ( kesk . ) and finance minister petteri orphan ( kok . ) budjettiriihen below .
yes , in the sense that the vm &apos;s proposal is not the new cuts , because of the cuts in social security has already been decided kehysriihessä in the spring .

ansiosidonnaisen will be shortened the duration of unemployment support from 400 to 500 .
koulutusleikkaukset continue .
kuntavaalit haunt the
why are ministers so quick to highlight is the fact that these on top of that does not make further cuts ?
since the next year is an election year .
kuntavaalit will be held in april , and they are the most important of the legislature , the thermometer , not gallupit .
ennenkin we have seen that the governing parties in different directions-consuming kuntavaalitulos discredits the government set the tone for a long time .
gallupit , however , indicate that the ruling party perussuomalaisia rökäletappio to wait for the outcome of the election , even though its previous eduskuntavaaleihin was modest compared to 12.3 % .
finns party won four years ago , 752 new councillors , including for a large number of illnesses in the spring of next year oikeistohallituksessa influence on the price .
three more or less as a major party in the government &apos;s lifeline depends on it , that the finns kantti lasts .
now it is not taken , but more than half of those who voted for a party had enough of the hallituspolitiikasta already in the first year .
the first signs of the party also eduskuntaryhmän käymistilasta have come to the surface .
the new cuts will not -retoriikalla , first of all , obscures the fact that next year there will be a smokescreen to perussuomalaisia and , secondly , to try to soften the blow .
suurleikkaukset in the year 2018 ?
at the time , all of this is likely to be different - sipilän if the government is still standing .
the government has set itself a target of indebtedness taittumisen during this parliamentary term , but petteri orpon debt in the next year &apos;s draft budget will be eur 5.9 billion , more than this year .
after kuntavaalien the government has two options .
the first is to raise their hands in the air , already in the middle of the legislature , and admits that the government will not be able to comply with its own agenda : it is not taitu or even slowed down .
the second is to stick to the programme .
it means the former on a new even harsher cuts in the 2017 budjettiriihessä .
budget runnottaisiin at least close to the balance of the year , during the spring of 2018 and then against the parliament this will be what it will be .
these measures debt is not taitu
it is quite clear that the current measures in place , even if the debt is not taitu juha sipilä how to try to stir up the positive mood .
secretary of state , martti hetemäen tiedostustilaisuudessa budget presented by those are evidence of its vastaansanomattomasti :
global economic growth prospects have repeatedly proved ylioptimistisiksi , in other words , is not going to be leading the international economy .
finland &apos;s economy is not just risen in 2008 after the collapse of the face , not only on a temporary basis in 2010 , at the beginning of the 21st century of stimulating policy at the time .
unemployment has increased by 35 % in the last decade and dragged on for an average of 34 to 54 weeks .
unemployment is now paying the price for three billion euros a year more than in 2008 .
hetemäen esittelemillä käyrillä the government debt , which exceeded 60 % threshold in 2014 , will rise to 70 % by the middle of the next decade .
what is responsible ?
in the spring of 2015 , presented by vasemmistoliiton velkaelvytys was rejected because it was deemed to be irresponsible .
next year , unemployment in the maintenance costs of around six billion euros , which will be covered by the new debt through the practice altogether .
this is in the centre of the moderate , finns and the perception of what is responsible .

snapchatin &quot; anime &quot; -tehostetta aasialaiskarikatyyriksi criticises
according to the snapchatin anime has acted as a source of inspiration for suodattimelle but , according to some observers , it is a racist .
linssityökalunsa allows snapchat allows the user to around 150 million daily reality in europe and to stop playing identity in ways that are almost laughable .
you can change the koiraksi ananakseksi are getting all worked up , or the figure , which would suit by roy lichtenstein maalaukseen .
linssit are simple , kasvonpiirteitä väänteleviä tools , which generate more than 30 million of the enhanced selfietä a day .
all of the steps will soon end up in public documents .
snapchatin linssejä has previously been criticised for unfounded accusations that the app to advertise blackface- , or &quot; mustanaama &quot; -maskia or favours valkaistua kauneusihanteena colour .
so when snapchat boasted this week for some users , which gave them a linssiä vinot vinot eyes , teeth and pulleat posket , some critics called it racism karikatyyriksi asian people - &quot; keltanaamaksi &quot; , i.e. the yellowfaceksi .
and they are wondering whether these repeated polemiikit to be a sign of the company &apos;s bigger problem with regard to diversity .
the news and indignation spread widely on wednesday in the vergen and motherboardin as a result of the reports , a day later , snapchat said lakkauttaneensa feature .
the company offered an explanation : lens was kunnianosoitukseksi animehahmoille karikatyyriksi , not asians .
but racism experienced observers lens was a reminder of the killings in the operation of the stereotypes .
others animevertailun vehemently denied by .
grace sparapani , an american-korealais taideopiskelija twiittiä photographs , which were distributed widely , said sähköpostissaan that lens was &quot; at the very least offensive and inconvenient . &quot;
he added , however , that &quot; it is difficult to argue against , for comparison , which are side by side and outrageous aasialaiskarikatyyri suodattimen tehosteet . &quot;
it shows that the filter is not the only , but the extreme keltanaama keltanaama vietynä halventavuuteen .
snapchat is not the only company , which goes beyond these cultural ansalankoja .
the american culture seems to stick to the endless struggle for diversity and inclusion in hollywood korporaatioiden , a conference room and equipment , which all of us in our hands .
and snapchatin a huge , diverse rodullisesti parents of young people in the audience may mean that they are even more likely to be waiting for sensitive attitude .
the 25-year-old katie zhu said in an interview on thursday that , when one of the snapchatin linsseistä creates an image of an insult to the user , &quot; these types is much more difficult to be invisible . &quot;
on thursday , zhu , who works mediumille tuotepäällikkö and an engineer , decided to remove the snapchat accounts and urged others to do the same .
kirjoitelmassaan mediumille puhelinhaastattelussa and he said , &quot; i believe that the racial controversy snapchatin palkkauskäytäntöjen reflect a lack of diversity .
zhu criticised the company &apos;s mainly white miesjohtoa and decided to kirjoitelmansa hashtagilla # deletesnapchat # poistasnapchat )
&quot; either they do not have different ihonvärien henkilökunnassaan diverse representation , which is why they are able to make these sorts of decisions , &quot; sino-american zhu said , &quot; or they have a different ihonvärien representatives to work , but they are not in the position where , to feel safe , or be able to talk directly . &quot;
some observers will share his opinions , snapchat has filed a complaint , which largely unanswered .
the company is not public figures , pointing out the diversity of their status as a private company .
on thursday , snapchat refused to discuss his staff rotutaustoista but , according to a representative of the company to focus on building some time ago rekrytoijan aliedustettuihin populations and to push forward the internal sisällyttämispyrkimyksiä .
for its part , zhu said that attaches to the snapchat accounts closed adding : &quot; i wonder whether in such a way that they actually need more hit users to be able to say that it is not ok . &quot;
congress , according to a panel of military officers who misused intelligence to the isis
on thursday , the panel said in a report published by the authorities of the congress of the united states armed forces headquarters sotatoimialueen muokanneen tiedusteluraportteja optimistisemman to present an image of iraq and syria &apos;s war against the isisiä , than what justified the events on the ground .
edustajainhuoneen puolustusvoimakomitean republikaanipuheenjohtajan puolustusmääräraha tiedustelukomitean , and the task force set up by the subcommittee osavuosikatsausraportissa were found &quot; widespread dissatisfaction &quot; among the headquarters of tiedusteluanalyytikkojen managers , who said that those who fiddle their assessments of the american efforts to win the isis .
centcomina päämaja , which is known , is the headquarters of the armed forces sotatoimialueen florida tampassa , which is controlled by the us military operations in the middle east and central asia .
&quot; the high-arvoisempien centcomin agreed by the leaders of the intelligence outputs typically gave the us terrorisminvastaisista efforts more positive picture than what the facts on the ground , justified . they were more positive than in the intelligence community , as a rule , as well as other factors in the analysis , &quot; a report said in a press release .
&quot; centcomin events are unacceptable - taistelijamme suffer as a result of the war , when the bad analysis provides a high-ranking politicians , &quot; representative ken calvert of california , republikaani , said .
centcomin the failures of leadership at the top of the organisation until all match .
kymmensivuisessa report describes in detail the persistent problems with my descriptions of events in the united states , and the analysis of the headquarters of the efforts to train iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015 .
even if it does not provide clear evidence that the obama administration would be imposed by the administration of the high-ranking peukaloitavaksi reports , it is the image of the analysts tunteneen than centcomin leaders would have put them under pressure to describe the islamic state , in the light of the threat posed by islamic state , positiivisemmassa .
&quot; the whole of the first half of 2015 , many of the headquarters of the press releases , the statements to congress and the certificates were much more positive than the events themselves , &quot; the report said .
centcomin authority , for example , said publicly that a wholesale attack back in the areas of mosul could begin as early as april or may 2015 .
mosul , iraq &apos;s second largest city , is still held by the islamic state .
&quot; after months of investigation , this is very clear , &quot; representative mike pompeo , of kansas republikaani , said in the statement .
the 2014 in the middle of 2015 to the middle of the armed forces of the united states , the headquarters of the high-sotatoimialueen arvoisimmat tiedustelujohtajat manipulated by the combination of the headquarters of the intelligence is threatening to undermine islamic state in iraq .
republikaanit after consulting created a task force that analysts had expressed concern about the fact that an islamic state manipulation of intelligence .
on thursday , the publication of the results of the report will be followed by a more extensive investigation is ongoing .
the ylitarkastaja has launched an extraordinary , ongoing investigation into the centcomin intelligence .
edustajainhuoneen tiedustelukomitean demokraattijäsenet published on thursday , its own löydöksensä who were identical republikaanityöryhmän with some of the conclusions .
&quot; over the years 2014 and 2015 , the centcom created between the islamic state and iraqi security forces tiedusteluarvioinnista unnecessarily isolated process , &quot; representative adam b. schiff , the committee &apos;s leading democrat , said in the statement .
according to the schiffin tiedustelutuotosten kept delaying the publication of this process , &quot; &quot; effect , the mood among analysts and &quot; given enough space for the various eriäville . &quot;
schiff and democrats have said that they have not found evidence that the white house had tried to put pressure on the centcomin analyytikkoja to reconcile its conclusions &quot; on the set or political kerrontaan . &quot;
the daily beast reported on tuesday , the congress of the preliminary findings of the investigation .
last august , the new york times reported that the pentagon ylitarkastaja has launched an investigation after complaints centcomin analysts .
commander patrick evans , a pentagon spokesman , said in the statement that the ministry of defence has not commented on the report of the congress ylitarkastajan as long as the investigation is ongoing .
but he said that &quot; the experts disagree on the interpretation of the data between the complex , and the tiedusteluyhteisö and the ministry of defence will keep a healthy dialogue on these key national security issues is to be welcomed . &quot;
the study is more than just the jälkiseuraamuksia , what will be the question of whether the us-led pommitustoimet in iraq and syria successful ( such as a growing number of puolustusviranomaisista now claim ) .
last year the accusations questioned how much president obama cannot count on the headquarters to provide honest assessments of iraq , afghanistan , libya and other kriisikohteiden military operations .
islamic state intelligence criticism reflects more than a decade ago , when the dispute centcomin tiedusteluanalyytikko , gregory hooker , wrote tutkimusartikkelin , which said that , despite the protests of several analysts , president george w. bush &apos;s administration , supported by a small army of iraq and spent very little time to consider what the consequences of the 2003 attack .
hooker was also key kapinassa on the islamic state of intelligence .
the authorities in the last year , according to the hookerin the group concluded that , despite public statements to the contrary , the air strikes against the islamic state controlled those refineries were not significantly weakened the economy of a terrorist group , because it was built tilapäisjalostamoita in order to sell oil on the black market .
the times reported in september that this discovery is not , however , told from the headquarters .
centcomin what was then the commander , general lloyd j. austin iii : 8th , was criticised last year after a number of lawmakers saw his todistustaan senate ylipositiivisena assessment of the war .
general austin was retired in april , and in his place came to the headquarters of general joseph l. votel .
the united states won for the fourth time in a row with the british women &apos;s maahockeyssa systemic class enemies ’ .
the day after that , when i was done with three goals in the team have shown about japan 6-1 , katie bam adopted on thursday , the united states women &apos;s maahockeyjoukkueen the first two goals of the indian american supremacy of 3-0 .
five goals in two of the game sounds unohtumattomalta saavutukselta , but the 27-year-old bam said that he was not sure whether he was previously done the same thing .
&quot; i have no idea , &quot; he said .
&quot; i am really not the kind of person who keeps the book maaleistaan . &quot;
but he knows this : americans are 4-0-situation olympialaisturnauksessa and they share in the first place in the group , with the british , who was still an unbeatable , after winning thursday , japan &apos;s 2-0 .
britain and the united states face on saturday in the final game of the first round .
both teams have survived neljännesvälieriin , and this game will decide who comes first and who is the second of six team in their group .
first of all , based in the netherlands , to avoid a second group leader , at the beginning of the neljännesfinaalien a little bit longer .
how can any of the saturday &apos;s game will come to an end , the americans have caused a stir the unexpected menestyksellään here , four years after they were left at the london olympics last 12 team .
bam , iran was in the team .
he grew by pennsylvania blue bellissä and maahockeymailan to carry the lead for the first time at the age of 3 ( he played the older kaksoissisarensa drexelissä ) , in the context of the species maajoukkueeseen at the age of 16 , when he became the youngest player of all time .
he was not involved in the 2008 olympics , because it is unable to be included in the final pelaajalistaan .
in 2012 , nothing has gone to him and his joukkuetovereilleen .
the following year , an englishman craig parnham valmentajaksi was appointed , and things began to change .
&quot; the change of culture , the spiritual change , physical change , &quot; bam said .
we are not in london have been similar to promote further intensification of work than we have now .
we have made a u-turn .
thursday evening bam , iran began to find the first puoliajan rystylyönnillä close to the finishing line .
india had come into the game turnauksessa a single victory , but the team was surprisingly hard and had the 1-0-lukemissa until late in the third instalment of the bam , iran took control of the situation .
he carried the ball into the left side of the field for a long time , then toured kiskaisi and the ball in the middle of the finishing line , thereby depriving the american 2-0-leadership .
melissa gonzalez added a goal in the middle of the fourth instalment in the last .
this nollapeli was one of the first tournament in the united states goaltender jackie briggsille , which had allowed one goal in each of the first three victory .
he is bringing in good .
it is also bam , iran .
&quot; we now have a good situation , &quot; parnham said , but its goodness will depend on the outcome of saturday &apos;s game .
peace in the midst of the trampoliinin olympialaisvimman
where any oletkaan , any time , the olympic games are on the way .
rio de janeiro events seem inevitable , and the continual raivoisalta viestiltä competition and the effort .
just as in olympiasoihtu liekehtivä would be a baton , which will be passed on to uimarille and jousiampujalta voimistelijalta triathlonistille .
it is impossible to put on the television , to read a newspaper or listen to the debate vierustoverin in amsterdam in the queue , without consulting simone bilesista , katie ledeckysta or michael phelpsin and chad le clos &apos; n &apos; between them .
and then there is the logan dula .
dula , the olympic games and the future sydäntenmurskaaja ensikertalainen hymykuoppineen , could well be one of the names of all the knowledge , which will be presented to the prime time , and which kannattelevat sponsorisopimukset as well as the good times and the tv ads - if he would be the swimmer , voimistelija or even a fencer .
but the california lake forestista from dula , 28 , is competing olympiakullasta trampoliinissa .
olympialiekki valaise not all of the species just as much .
further afield , in the shadow of the centre , in part , are the species , which all are generally do not accept : ilmapistooliammunta , archery , badminton , taekwondo .
we have always breaststroke , for a long time it live .
but if i have to make a fuss erityissuosikistani , i would like to draw your attention to some limited trampoliinin then .
although trampoline has been olympialaji since the year 2000 , when it did ensiesiintymisensä at the sydney olympics , its presence is in the middle of the past 16 years , the comments so little in the way of that , many of which do not have any haastattelin , olympialaislajin it is .
this may be a regional ignorance .
although the united states has sent the athletes to compete in the sport , it has never won it of being an athlete , and it moved up until the final , before , in 2012 .
the chinese and russians share of men in general , the chinese and canadian women &apos;s you .
this year , china &apos;s dong dong and canadian rosie mclennan defend kultamitaleitaan in london .
trampoliiniin , however , there is a certain charm resides , in part because of the fact that i am illiterate , it sounds like a suitable klovnikouluun better than the olympic games .
in this regard , i must confess that i am not an expert , i am just lentokyvytön fan trying .
lajissa is , as we see opportunities for huvittavuuteen piirrosfilmien loppumattomien pomppujen vibration , but it is also voimistelun and uimahypyn sulokkuutta , the two species , which is , in principle , it is a combination of .
the word &quot; trampoline ” comes from the spanish word for el trampolín , which means ponnahduslautaa .
european mestaruuden hyppivät jättimäisellä trampoliinilla up to nearly 30 feet altitude , and they will be carrying out translations , kieppuvia liikesarjoja ( taittoja and voltteja ) and , in the end , to land on their feet .
the official olympic games , according to the implementation of the programme , they will be judged on the difficulty of , &quot; and &quot; on the basis of the flight time .
the 32 athletes competing in rio from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women .
the most common , the direction of the olympic games is straight forward .
mitalia who must go to gold in the search for further , faster , up and over - sometimes up to the finishing line , sometimes in the back and forth across the spectrum .
they are not the only maaliviivaa or aloitusseinämää , but also , in a televised media reporting of the second irvailevaa border : global or olympiaennätystä .
this is a determined pursuit of noble , admirable and even fanatical - and it will be able to get even a spectator in tears .
but it is also the reason why the games katsominenkin can be a bit wearing .
trampoline offers lepohetken for this .
trampoliinin the direction is up .
the aim is not to move forward .
kilpailija there will be a new start affecting painottomalta as an astronaut , goes up , then down , then up again easily .
that , of course , does not interfere with the competition and the degree of difficulty , but during the course of the programme is not the relentless rush towards the end , not the leaps forward into the distance , the only time and gravity unenomainen , smooth stoppages .
it is so close to the zen-room , than what can be achieved at the olympics .
women karsintakilpailut and then finaali will take place on friday afternoon at the beginning of the mission at 13 ( et ) , the men &apos;s games will come on saturday , also at 13 .
nbc to send the finals as part of the afternoon ohjelmistoaan starting at 14 on both days .
olympiahuuman in the middle of a quiet , they offer a lovely moment , which probably will not see the general chaos .
and if awareness can only be achieved by offering miesurheilijoita tuijotettavaksi esineellistettäväksi miesvoimistelijat ( such as the united states and some time ago suggested that , according to the wall street journalin dula ) , just wait for the new fanikuntaansa huokailevaa .
&quot; generation demonstrate &quot; in ethiopia , which is an ally of the us in the long term
violent demonstrations in ethiopia
the political change in ethiopia , the demonstrators are calling for the government have encountered violent resistance .
eye witnesses say that they are going to say that dozens of demonstrators have been shot dead in clashes with the police .
is ethiopia unravelling ?
over the past decade , it has been one of africa &apos;s most stable countries , a strong ally of the west , whose economy is growing rapidly .
over the past few months of demonstrations against the government , however , the country has been shaken by spreading more and more areas .
in the last week , thousands of people taking to the streets , demanding ryntäsi a radical political change .
ihmisoikeusryhmien , according to the government &apos;s response was relentless .
eye witnesses say that they have said that the police officers shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators .
levinneet nauhoitetut in the demonstrations , the videos , which are believed to be at the end of the last year or the beginning of this year , appear to be , how the security authorities are ready to give young people with sticks , at the same time , when they were forced to stand up against the wall over his ears .
the united nations pääihmisoikeusviranomainen is now demanding a thorough analysis of the research .
&quot; it was always difficult to keep the country together , and in the future it will be even more difficult , &quot; said rashid abdi , who is the horn of africa projektipäällikkö -tutkimusryhmässä the international crisis group .
ethiopia is africa &apos;s second most populous country after nigeria , and the west in the value of its stability .
american military and intelligence agencies are working in close cooperation with the ethiopian in the fight against terrorist threats in the region , particularly in somalia , and hardly any of the west african country to receive so much help .
ethiopia &apos;s economy has grown at an impressive rate .
its infrastructure has improved a lot in the extreme , and the capital , addis ababa is even a new commuter train .
the streets of the city are typically a quiet , safe and clean .
although not ethiopia has not , however , been democracy mallikuva . human rights groups have consistently talked about the government &apos;s repression of the opposition , the country has been limited , and dissidents have been effectively .
many people have been expelled from the country , imprisoned , killed or driven far beyond the desert .
but this may be changing .
&quot; if the tukahdutat people , and they have no other option than to demonstrate , this will be the case , &quot; seyoum teshome , a professor at the university of central from ethiopia , said .
throughout the youth to demonstrate .
one of the generation to demonstrate .
complaints are varied and cover everything from land use the stranglehold of the power of the ruling coalition .
last year , a lot of kritisoitujen after the elections , the ruling party and its allies won the last of the opposition &apos;s place , and now it must be in possession of all parliamentary seats .
at the same time , rising tensions in the border with eritrea . the tense and disputed border along the route of the fight has been claimed hundreds of lives in june .
, which analysts fear that as the oromo liberation front , or the ogaden national liberation front , which has , in recent years , more or less been defeated , may try to take advantage of the turmoil and the arm again .
a number of factors explain why kuohumisen beneath the surface , after years of bitter feelings are now räjähtämässä .
the first appears to be seemingly vaarattomalta : smartphones .
only in the last few years a large number of ethiopians have been able to communicate via social media , when cheaper smartphones have become more frequent and internet service improved .
even if the government closes access facebookiin and twitteriin , as it often does , especially during the demonstrations , many people can still communicate location piilottavien välityspalvelimien via the network .
many young ethiopians have said that this is the way they came together for the purpose of the demonstrations .
secondly , ethiopia &apos;s two largest ethnic groups , the oromo people and the amhara people , will be better off with each other .
oromo people and the amhara people are not natural allies .
a very long time amhara people who come from ethiopia , a predominantly christian ylängöiltä were in politics and in business , using oromoita , many of whom are muslims , who live in alangoilla .
but this , too , is changing .
&quot; we are on the road to the organization of one under one umbrella , &quot; oromojohtaja mulatu gemechu said .
the biggest protests have been amhara- and oromoalueilla .
many of the amhara people and the oromo people think that it is unfair to the people of ethiopia is dominated by the tigre . they cover of around six percent of the population and is dominated by the military , intelligence service , trade and politics .
the third reason for the unrest is the loss of meles zenawi .
mr meles , the former rebel leader , was the ethiopian prime minister for 17 years until he died in a secret illness in 2012 .
he was nerona tactical method to break down , as the man who saw the kulmien all around .
analysts say that he was particularly qualified for early signs of the evolution of discontent and the use of secret ambassadors to the conclusion of the opponents .
&quot; nykyhallinnolla is not the kind of perusvaistoa konfliktianalyytikko , &quot; abdi said .
ethiopian prime minister hailemariam desalegn , a new poimittiin , a relatively unknown to meet mr meles ’ s shoes .
unlike mr meles , who had come from the northern region of ethiopia , the tigre , hailemariam is from the south .
analysts say that tigrejen controlled by the security services do not trust him .
many people fear that this could lead to more bloodshed .
the last time was in such turmoil with ethiopia in 2005 , when thousands of protesting about the elections , according to analysts , who contributed to the impression that the government first hutiloi and then plundered them .
in the ensuing sweep many of the demonstrators were killed , albeit to a lesser extent than in the last few months , and will bring the anxiety went over a period of relatively quickly .
kehitysasiantuntijat have been praised by the ethiopian leaders with vision , such as the new infrastruktuurisuunnittelusta työmatkajunasta köyhyydenvastaisessa , and considerable progress in the fight .
but clearly , this has not stopped the country &apos;s internal to the ethiopian government &apos;s contempt for the growth of .
and now it is beginning to get dangerous , ethnic form .
last month , the city was attacked by protesters in the amhara gondarissa tigrejen owned businesses , and the hatred against the tigre is becoming more and more common on social media .
analysts say that the protests are giving their support to the united states and others seem cumbersome status .
the american government has used the base camp of neighbouring ethiopia lennokkilennoille somalia , even though it some time ago sulkeneensa said this base .
although the west clearly want to support democracy , they do not want the already unstable region allies plummet .
&quot; this , &quot; abdi said , &quot; is a real juggling act . &quot;
donald trump to explain the obama-was set up by the islamic state of the arguments &quot; sarkasmiksi &quot;
donald j. trump has tried to suppress the latest campaign to be sweeping the dispute on friday , claiming that he was not serious when he this week on a number of occasions intti that president obama and hillary clinton was one of the founders of the islamic state terrorist group &quot; . &quot;
the report raised new questions about the republican presidential candidate &apos;s ability to communicate clearly amerikkalaisyleisölle .
it also set out his supporters , who have strained to defend him in a turbulent period , in a difficult position , where they have to explain to the comments , which he does not necessarily mean .
keskiviikkoillan kampanjakokouksessa on an insinuation , trump claimed the same ever more interviews on thursday , where he intti that is , indeed , his intention was to say that the president and clinton created the islamic state .
early friday morning twitter-publication , however , trump has said that he was only a sarcastic .
this publication was a reversal from the previous day , when trump said in a number of interviews that they were really serious about their convictions .
when konservatiiviradiojuontaja hugh hewitt tried to help trumpia loiventamaan reply by reminding him that obama wants to destroy the islamic state , the republican presidential candidate , has taken this fell on deaf ears .
the latest arvostelumyrsky is going to be in a situation in which trump has tried again to focus his campaign on the economy falling mielipidetutkimustulosten in the middle .
trump and clinton fought when he talks about the economy this week michiganissa .
on friday , trump tried once again to return to the subject .
paeten twitteriin again , he warned , however , that clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes , and that he was giving a speech in tylsistyttävänä .
trump has in the past used sarkasmipuolustusta .
late in july after he faced widespread criticism seems to suggest that the russians should hack into clinton &apos;s emails , he later explained their comments by saying &quot; of course i am sarcastic . &quot;
this approach makes it possible that trump will be able to engage in political speech at the borders , and then , if necessary , to go back to back .
&quot; i think that it is a model , in which he is a test of some of the messages , which are important for his faneilleen . he considers how they work , and then to &apos; clarify &apos; in one direction or another , depending on the reaction , &quot; said ruth sherman , viestintäasiantuntija , who has followed the two candidates in the language .
but i also think that he is viekas in terms of opinions and to know that they are sufficiently vague , so that they can be filtered through the lens of a number of different .
instead , the great äänestysyleisöä that would relax their speeches , trump has in the last few days have been more sapekkaampi when his popularity has continued to fall .
the new , published on friday in the nbc / wall street journal / marist-survey showed that trump is lagging far behind clinton in north carolina , virginia and colorado , and that is a tight contest in florida .
even if trump , as a rule , is trying to avoid the apologies sanomistaan provocative issues , he often blame arvostelijoitaan realising the wrong words or huumorintajunsa wrong understanding .
his face increasing scrutiny over the past few months , the presidential campaign trumpin that have forced his faithful allies in an uncomfortable position , where they have to publicly support him , no matter how provocative his comments are .
the former new york mayor rudolph w. giuliani , who is one of the most important supporters trumpin , saw a great deal of trouble in defending the candidate in an interview with cnn on thursday .
&quot; i believe that , in his words , he is a real political comments , &quot; giuliani said , when he was asked about this in the context of the rightness of trumpin argument that obama and clinton was set up by the islamic state .
it is true , in the sense that , before obama isis was almost unknown , a small organisation , which he called the amatööriksi , completely wrong , and that is why this happened , because he pulled troops out of iraq .
most mainstream republicans are trying to claim that the obama administration , in which clinton worked for the foreign secretary , will not allow islamic state get worse , because it has not been able to effectively deal with the situation in the middle east .
prior to the meetings in pennsylvania on friday , trump went on the attack on twitter towards uutismediaa who bang on her at its word and are biased against him .
he made fun of &apos; bad , &apos; &apos; pathetic tv experts who are trying to get him a clear words , &quot; they are going to fail . &quot;
some democrats pilkkasivat trumpin excuse for a new todistusaineistoksi for the fact that he is unsuitable for a president .

&quot; a square meal : lamakauden stultifying food
in march 1933 , shortly after the president , franklin delano roosevelt virkahuoneessaan istuutui to eat lunch .
herkkusuuna president roosevelt had hienostuneista on fifth avenuen foods , such as hanhenmaksapasteijasta , and maryland suokilpikonnakeitosta .
on the day of his diet was more modest : filled eggs , and jälkiruoaksi tomaattikastikkeessa perunasosetta luumuvanukasta .
&quot; from time to time , it was an expression of solidarity to the people who are suffering , &quot; jane ziegelman said .
her husband , andrew coe , added : &quot; it was also a message to the americans about how should eat . &quot;
brooklyn resident couple is heightsissä ruokahistorioitsijoita .
coen case , the latest book , chop suey , told the chinese food in america , and ziegelman told the life in the lower east siden kerrostalosta through the food in his book 97 orchard .
their latest cooperation , &quot; a square meal , which the harper will publish on tuesday , comes to the american food during the great depression of the 1930s .
by demonstrating some of their own culinary solidarity with the journalist they meet for dinner eisenberg &apos;s sandwich shopissa , pikkuruisessa , hienostelemattomassa lounasbaarissa flatironin in the region , which has been in operation since the 1929 pörssiromahduksesta .
ziegelman , 54 , ordered cream cheese-oliivivoileivän , and coe , 57 , took control of the dose kalkkunalla , perunasoseella and kasviksilla .
when the journalist ordered lihamureketta , the couple saw fit to discuss lamakauden eating .
&quot; murekkeet were very popular , &quot; ziegelman said .
it was maapähkinämureketta , maksamureketta , papumureketta .
they were valmistusaineesta and some cheap ingredient , which extended the actual material .
imagine syöväsi maapähkinöitä so much that they would form a päivällisesi .
. coe irvisti
&quot; it is certainly seemed mahassa lyijynraskaalta , &quot; he said .
during the period before the wasteland of american tables , especially in rural areas , it was like eating-so-far-than-jaksat-noutopöytä .
women &apos;s groups have made food male farm workers , and fresh piirakkaa saw breakfast , lunch and dinner .
the americans sent food to starving in europe during the first world war . &quot; a square meal -kirja kronikoi the ways in which the nation survived that , all of a sudden , it was no longer in the land of plenty .
&quot; at the time , food became a key , fraught subject to the americans , &quot; coe said , explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it .
equally distressing was a new , affordable diet : mysteeriruokalajeista such as murekkeista and laatikoista , became the main dishes , and the box was &quot; a great way to use ruoantähteitä , &quot; ziegelman said , because the chefs were able to conceal the less attractive ingredients kermaisen kastikekerroksen below .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit .
lihasta , which had for years been at the heart of the amerikkalaisaterioiden annosteltu sparingly , became a luxury .
there erikoisia koosteita kalorimäärän and nutritional considerations is more important than the taste or even common sense in the kitchen .
in the research , but also a book of recipes for the era of ziegelman cooked dish , which met the onions exported paistettuja maapähkinävoilla .
&quot; it was not a popular addition to the dining room , &quot; coe said .
ziegelman pointed out : &quot; it was surreal . &quot;
peanut butter is not in any way fit paistettuihin sipuleihin .
this was characterised by many households resepteille .
kotitalousasiantuntijat such as louise stanley , the director of the federal kotitalousviraston in 1923-1943 , presided over the country &apos;s eating habits of more than ever before or since .
julkaisten recipes and articles for newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to start &quot; budjetoijiksi &quot; and to respond to the challenge of spaghetti , such as carrots and converted into soseutetun möykyt maistuviksi annoksiksi .
&quot; a square meal is the historical makupalojen a festival .
especially tasty are reports on the government &apos;s reaction to the hungry people , such as president herbert hoover let me eat cake &apos; attitude .
at the same time , when he publicly praised the childhood simple , iowalaista maalaisruokaa , he is as subtle as a buddhist , which he had become a millionaire .
&quot; he was supposed to continental food , such as fish kurkkukastikkeella , &quot; coe said .
he ate almost kullatussa ruokailuhuoneessa wearing tuxedo .
he was one of the great outdoors for everything .
the president roosevelt would have been able to make the same mistake , if not his wife , eleanor , had encouraged him to set an example in its own vatsallaan .
as the paper explains , when mrs roosevelt , treasurer of the building , which had no interest in the taste , the white house became the seat , which &quot; is offered only washington ankeimpiin but also surkeimmin manufactured food . &quot;
many lamanaikaisista the eating habits were rejected , as soon as the country got back on its feet .
our focus is the continued perintönä kaloreihin and nutrition , ziegelman said , and in the way in which science applied for cooking .
a couple , said that when he wrote in the book , they achieved a better understanding of the mother ziegelmanin the eating habits , for example , about how he was not able to throw food away .
&quot; he really feared waste of food , &quot; coe said .
ziegelman recalling : &quot; he even sairastutti people . &quot;
. it happened tuulihattuvälikohtaus
then , when the plates they smash eisenbergissä were empty , he and coe were pulling out jälkiruoan that they were produced at home : luumujälkiruoan , which president roosevelt ate a little .
&quot; it is called luumuvaahdoksi , &quot; ziegelman said , adding that the general trick was to give the moderate voices resepteille be reflected in the name .
jälkiruoassa was not only kermavaahtoa , luumuja , a little bit of flour , sugar , water and a touch .
all averse , upottivat lusikkansa tahmeaan ruskeaan liisteriin .
surprisingly , it was not bad .
coe santsasi again , and another .
kuulostaen budjetoijalta understood , he told his wife : &quot; a little chopped-up saksanpähkinöitä could help . &quot;

&quot; i personally recommend yazdin in towns and cities from shiraz and isfahan at some point , visit . they have been preserved persialaisen the civilisation of ancient monuments in good condition , &quot; he said .
the british papers , callum skinner crashed over the finishing line napatessa pyöräilykultaa
scotland &apos;s callum skinner joukkuesprintissä pyöräilystadionilla kiisi glorification of men in rio last night , when the great britain team defended the trio mestaruuttaan london dating back to 2012 .
glasgow 28,662 from the 23-year-old was as an anchor role , where his skottikollegansa sir chris roy made yet , the legend was proud when this kiisi napaten victory over the finishing line tiimiltä a favourite in new zealand .
britain took the shokkivoiton four years ago , at the same time as hoy won the fifth of six olympiakullastaan .
and they reiterated their stunt sijoituttuaan kuudensiksi modestly in march when the line in the world cup finals in london , even though the hoy has since decided to kilpauransa .
the beijing and london games , the problem was the erikoislähettäjä jamie staffin substitution .
this was achieved with just in time , when the hindes appeared .
hoyn indefinite suspension also created a vacuum that kian emadi and matt crampton attempted to fill .
skinner was a man , of which the british sports coaches insisted skotissa in relation to the potential , which is now understood .
hindes , kenny - who won with hoyn mastery over four years ago - and mr skinner did olympiaennätyksen time-on time , but the new zealand took the lead in the first round .
and brittikolmikko kaksintaistelun won the gold .
hindes was narrowly behind after his tour of its own , but kenny pushed the leadership of the team , and mr skinner had to stick with it .
strategiamuutos was a big part of the metamorphosis , and it was one of the larger hindesin driving heard , so that he would slow down and allow kennyn and , in particular , the skinner to keep pace .
hoy was followed by their status as an expert on the bbc , and drew the attention of the skinner , kennyn palkintokorokkeelle hindesin and the attention of their office .
the 23-year-old glasgowlainen skinner said : &quot; comparison is flattering . &quot;
i am just here to do my best and hankkiakseni reputation .
we final olympiaennätyksen maailmanmestarit and we won .
it was an absolutely incredible .
there may be a better way to win .
voitettuaan london 2012 kennyn and alongside hoyn hindes admitted that it was deliberately crashed on the tracks after a bad startin .
he later withdrew her comments back in britain , and the two rivals have complained about .
at the time , an overwhelming victory in the case had not been a similar problem .
hindes said : &quot; it was when it would have been on the podium in london , when it was so much of british flags . &quot;
joukkueena we have found the link in the last three months .
we have lost so many maailmanmestaruutta , so winning the olympic games , once again , is simply fantastic .
one of the event , one of the people , who won a gold medal for a total of seven out of ten pyöräilylajista as well as in beijing and london .
if this is a reflection of the development of the last five months , we expect a successful pyöräilystadionilla five days .
kennyn on the basis of the condition is not at all impossible to imagine him toistamassa hoyn urotekoa , olympiakullan one of the three winning at the olympics .
it would mean that kennyn - which is exactly 12 years younger than hoy , who was also born on 23 march ( that seems to be on the sacred day for british sport , which is also a steve redgraven , mo farah and roger bannisterin &apos;s birthday ) - the total would rise to six gold medals and one silver .
it would be the same as the hoylla .
kenny is competing for the next sprintissä , which begins today and lasts for three days .
boltonista from the 28-year-old said : &quot; i enjoy now only this one .
fis is always the best .
it will be overcome , together with the boys &apos; .
overcoming alone is , quite frankly , lonely . &quot;
hindes said : &quot; if he wins another two kultamitalia , he should give the ritarin value . &quot;
this was the day the only mitalikilpailu , but britain received more good news .
sir bradley wiggins , ed clancy , steven burke and owain doull were the fastest time in the lives of the four , four kilometres joukkuetakaa-keep .
their time was 3 : 51 : 943 . &quot;
london 2012 gold won the world record of 3 : 51 : 659 .
the first round and finaali ( 22.42 ) will be held today , the second on the contest day , when wiggins is bound to be the centre of attention .
he had a dispute with the judges yesterday before the time-journeys , when officials called him pituusmittaukseen .
in a women &apos;s competition , which will continue and will end tomorrow , laura trott , joanna rowsell shand , elinor barker , katie archibald milngavien maailmanennätysajassa when the clock ran at the time of 4 : 13 : 260 .
great britain team has learned to trust that its mighty ratapyöräilyjoukkue to take control of the central part of the olympic games and to achieve a whole series of mitaleita .
care in beijing and london is truly exceptional and complete management , has been a downplaying expectations ahead of the rio games .
there has been a drama , not least of which was the technical director , shane that progress has been made , the difference in april , as well as for the sake of seksismi- and kiusaussyytteiden suurhenkilöiden such as hoyn and victoria pendletonin kilpauran , at the end of it .
based on the first evening pyöräilystadionilla competitions , however , it seems that britain now legendary reputation to emerge with a full orchestra , once again , that could be the case .
portland sulaton sign for the future of the questionable because of the cuts
portland alumiinisulaton victoria , as well as the hundreds of workers &apos; jobs , the future is uncertain , when the electricity plant jakeleva electricity company revealed that one of the owners of the factory is finishing jakelusopimuksen , so all the distribution is expected to be cut .
the measure will result in victoria earlier this year , the administration &apos;s decision to keep the plant in operation , and that the aid will not be extended .
20 years of the period to the end of a subsidy in november .
even in the 2000 jobs could be at risk of alcoa portland factory .
even the 2000 jobs could be at risk , directly or indirectly , as a result of the closure of the factory .
in addition to the snowball effect may be possible , because the sulatto used to around 10 per cent of the entire electricity in victoria .
in 2014 , alcoa &apos;s point henry sulaton anglesean in the last year , which led to the closure of the plant .
alcoa portland sulatto will lose money and has come under threat of closure .
the measure will now for a number of years of speculation about the future of the plant , which began as a result of the strong australian dollar and has recently due to the price of production at the plant .
agl , which distributes electricity to the latrobe alumiinisulatolle valleyssa voimalastaan an from loy yang , said that it also expects to decide on the other three , the owner of the contract .
the majority of the factory is owned by alcoa and aluminan syndicate , and chinese citic , as well as the japanese marubeni corp is owned by smaller percentages .
&quot; agl expects the continuation of the functioning of the factory in portland , which means that the sulaton physical shore will continue , &quot; it said .
according to agl &apos;s contracts are the so called &quot; suojautumissopimuksia &apos; , which was supposed to come into force in november 2016 .
contracts are 12 months of delay between the de facto , so they run out in 2017 .
&quot; that is the reason why agl looks forward to a productive outcome agreements tilivuodella 2017 , &quot; i said .
not all of the potential for agl tulosvaikutuksia tilivuodesta 2018 forward limit at the moment , the wholesale price of electricity futures market strong prospects .
agl said that it has already &quot; in anticipation of the end of the &quot; led to a decline in the value of the contracts on its books $ 187 million .
alcoa , said that the decision to end the agreements &quot; does not affect the alcoa ... &apos; ability to keep the smelting works in operation or secure electricity provision in sulaton . &quot;
the american company has said that it will set up a 20-year agreement with the loy yang in 2010 , and that the agreement was supposed to come into force in november this year , but it has not yet explained why withdrew from the agreement .
analysts have been wary of the portland , as well as victoriassa sulaton that is also located near newcastle tomagon the closure of the factory in the area because of the potential for the sake of the economic situation is dire .
in the past week , agl &apos;s executive director stephen mikkelsen said analysts across the portland spends approximately 600 megawatts of electricity and tomago around 900 mw .
&quot; if both factories will be removed from the market , it is a significant reduction in the &#91; electricity &#93; market demand .
we are in deep space , this would not be a good thing , &quot; he said .
kendall , not just a kardashianien reality tv star , is the cover of the september voguen
kendall jenner , 20 , a model of the mother and manager kris kardashian clan jennerin the fourth in the united states , is the daughter of voguen the desired number on the september cover .
kendall , who is estee lauderin brand ambassador and has been a model of milan , paris and new york muotiviikoilla , announced the news on thursday on instagram-to answer for .
&quot; this cap looking in the room , which is full of dear people , made me itkemään , &quot; kendall wrote .
kansijulkistusta was followed by a curious ( or perhaps just kardashianien in the style of a suitable ? ) , käsikirjoitettu reality-video , in which the whole kardashian clan-jennerin ( excluding ongelmatapaukset rob and caitlyn , and which was joined by all suosikkiviihdesetä , keeping upin producer ryan seacrest ) forgot her sister , cap , but which ended with the classic turning point : they suunnittelivatkin yllätysjuhlia .
it is almost every child of &quot; syntymäpäiväjakson &quot; kliseinen vuorosanat juonikuvio ( seacrest says , &quot; you don &apos;t have to , of course , that we will forget you &quot; aamupiirretyn pupujussin the credibility of krisin ) , but had to make another tyttönsä in some way to take advantage of this publicity .
this , therefore , that we will be moved to a new era of kardashianien voguen in september .
kendallin isosisko voguen perhaps kim went to the first ( he shared it with her husband kanye west in april 2014 ) , but the newspaper in september , and the number is at the top of the league .
voguen september is the number for the whole of the year , selling most of the edition .
it is more like a thickness of kahvipöytäkirjaa than muotilehteä , and no. attracts a huge number of advertisers ( fashionista fell from that last year &apos;s 832 pages opuksesta 615 was mainossisältöä ) .
its kansitähden revelations are expected to be so vehemently that , over the last two years , the images of the newspaper have been leaked ahead of the official julkistusta .
the women have been on the cover , inter alia , naomi campbell , linda evangelista and kate moss .
in recent years , cover has indeed been more &quot; julkkiksia , who act as models for the &quot; than &quot; models , which are julkkiksia . &quot;
oscar winner and by dior ambassador jennifer lawrence was the cover in 2013 , a year after the lady gaga pride of place .
but if that were to occur , jenner , the image of a generation which lehti menestysmalliksi &quot; , &quot; would be the first category , he has a pretty good company .
these julkkikset are not famous relatives of people or realitytähtiä or today &apos;s young people , who know how to make good the snapchat video ( although jenner is all of this ) .
they are , quite rightly , talented women who are doing the entertainment industry on .
last year kansimalli beyoncella lemonaden has been with the publication of one of the strongest years of his career .
not everyone , of course , not pleased jennerin success .
his reality tv historiallaan jennerin muotimaailmassa status there will always be fraught .
in june , the original victoria &apos;s secret model stephanie seymour criticised jenneriä and his colleagues , gigi hadidia by calling them &quot; ämmiksi this moment . &quot;
it is a sentiment that came to the fore again jennerin vogue as a result of the cap .
but tyytymättömyydessä pyöriminen is beside the point .
kendall jenner is voguen the september cover of number portability .
he supermalli is in the purest sense of the word .
he is a model for marc jacobs .
he fenamiphos you estee lauderin meikkivoidetta .
he and all his sister will sell you a pictures of themselves in their own , maksumuurin sovelluksissaan löytyvissä guarantees .
he sells pictures of cindy crawford tyttärestä which he took the love-newspaper .
and leisure time , possibly , only to see the sisartaan kourtneyta and his children , he is a reality tv star .

scientists have previously suggested that the slow process of venus pyörimisnopeutta to explain its thick atmosphere .
but the latest simulaatio refers to the fact that venuksella would have to be thin , terrestrial atmosphere , and it would still have been able to turn slowly .

in the oceans were dashed and its vesihöyryt ultraviolettivalossa have burned down .
when the hydrogen fled , there remained only in the thick of co2 into the atmosphere tappavine kasvihuonekaasuilmiöineen - venus , which we are familiar with today .

many of the stars are born around 125 million years ago , and are now on the way to achieving aikuisuuden .
they are now huipputasollaan .
huippupyörimisnopeudellaan aikuistuvat these stars of plunging into large quantities of tähtituulta .
when these winds go through the magnetic fields of stars , they put the brakes on the stars .
when the star is getting older , its revolutions per minute begins to slow down .
kepler is a test case for each star pyörimisnopeutta tähdenpilkkujen identify by following the arrival of these , such as auringonpilkkuja .
the latest list of stars pyörimisnopeuksien massiivisemmat refers to the fact that the stars revolve more slowly than less massive stars .
rebull compares with the stars tanssijoihin which the bigger make piruetteja more slowly than the smaller .
&quot; plejadien &quot; baletissa &quot; we can see that the slow pyörijät are usually massiivisempia , while the fastest pyörijät are usually very light stars , ” rebull said .
since the plejadien cluster is so close , it is an ideal laboratory cosmic pyörimisnopeuksilla the assessment of the properties of the stars .
&quot; plejadien pyörimisen ankkurin offers a cluster of stars , theoretical models , which include both directions , younger and older , ” rebull said .
we still have a lot to learn about how , when and why the stars are slowing down pyörimisnopeuttaan and , so to speak , to hang &apos; tanssikenkänsä &apos; tavallista up .
rebull and his colleagues have described the latest analysis plejadien pyörimisnopeuksista three in the article , which will soon be published in the astronomical journal .
