doctors on strike : the requirements of the new industrial action
representatives of the junior doctors are asked to accept the new collective measures holding their kiistassaan on the new agreement .
the british medical association medical association ( bma ) junior doctors committee ( jdc ) invites the committee of the whole council to support the new industrial action since the beginning of september .
jdc says that ministers have failed to grasp the concerns about the agreement .
junior doctors and medical students voted in july to deny the agreement which had been agreed with bma : n .
it was rejected by 58 % of the vote of the members .
in a letter published on thursday evening , the members of the jdc : n via twitter president ellen mccourt said that the government had &quot; persistently low &quot; issues , which , according to him , led to the rejection of the agreement .
he said : &quot; in the light of the statement of the government voted in this jdc : n fully in the proposed new treaty and formal position of all your concerns . &quot;
in response to the government &apos;s silence jdc : n the government has today submitted a formal request for the special meeting of the council of bma : n , in order to gradually increasing globalization and the expanding universe of starting early in september , the industrial action programme can count on .
the dispute has resulted in that the junior doctors have been involved in this in the first of the six to strike , including the complete work in the history of the nhs , the health care system of the solstice .
bma : n doctors , doctor johann malawana , resigned after the vote had been rejected the agreement negotiated , the terms recommended by the bma : n .

after the vote , the health minister , jeremy hunt said that the agreement will be to impose english doctors .
russia and turkey : a consortium of third parties ?
the gesture , which ended the crisis .
the russian and turkish leaders met tuesday in the kätelläkseen each other and proclaim the eight months of the battle of words and economic sanctions officially closed .
but vladimir putin in st. petersburg , the palace of tervehtiessä turkish kullatussa room , i got a clear impression that in ankara to this reconciliation .
yes , käteltiin .
but putin &apos;s smile looked like a little compulsion , and very little of their own apart from the uhkunut heat , even according to the standards .
recep tayyip erdogan , on the other hand , spoke of the constant &quot; dear friend &quot; putin himself to five times , according to a report .
freaking out .
he also vowed that relations with russia would return not only to its pre-crisis level , but even better .
the next day the newspapers here described erdogan &apos;s anticompetitive behaviour , as nothing bad would have never happened .
in my opinion , his zeal reflected the opposite .
but putin himself indicated that the russian leader with a radiant coolness has not forgotten anything .
in fact , the cause of the crisis was the first thing that he mentioned in his opening remarks : when turkey shot down a russian combat aircraft to the syrian border .
moscow &apos;s response at the time was raging .
putin attacked accusing ankara that it stabbed in moscow &apos;s back .
the insult was even worse , when it came to oletetulta from a friend .
a real confidence in the rebuilding is going to be difficult , maybe impossible .
russian public opinion has also changed since november .
for months , the state-controlled media led to the mind-boggling , in-depth attack against ankara .
suddenly it seemed as if the turks were to blame for all of this .
the most serious were the accusations that senior officials in erdogan &apos;s own family has benefited from the illegal oil trade isisin hallitsemilta of syria .
he has denied this .
but in st. petersburg the official message was that it is time to move on .
in the end , this meeting took place but that is why they are asking for an apology , putin was president of erdogan .
russia reached a sort of victory .
ankara a ceasefire agreement , the benefits are clear .
first of all , mr erdogan needs any friends after that , when he nearly ousted from power in last month &apos;s failed coup .
continuing terrorist attacks in turkey are also clearly shaken him .
in addition , there is an economic motive .
the russian economic sanctions have been a ban on charter flights , in particular for heavy , which usually carry many millions of venäläisturisteja the turkish coasts each year .
the number has fallen by almost 90 % .
as far as russia is concerned , local tour operators and charter airlines are sure to be relieved when the flights eventually will continue .
they are hoping for a late-season rush to the mediterranean sea .
and already this week , state tv has predicted for cheaper fruit and vegetables after the imports from turkey of agricultural products once again .
&quot; the tourists get there , tomatoes back here &quot; , as formulated in the report of the newspaper vedemosti .
but on a visit to moscow at this time was also a political added value .
ankara is angered western countries about what is considered a weak response to the yritettyyn coup .
when it is added to the time taken the resentment at a snail &apos;s pace for advanced eu member negotiations , the steps putin , who is eager to take advantage of the viileyttä and to erode turkey &apos;s ties with the west .
the russian leader was to be a way in which he guaranteed to be played after the coup in order to support the designated authorities .
of course , this is , of course , a foregone conclusion to moscow , which has its own deeply ingrained fear of change of power .
so this meeting in the seaside palace of the prameassa made it possible for the russian federation and turkey , presented by &quot; outside association &quot; as one analyst described the situation for me : the two countries that will experience the west rejected them and treated them incorrectly , the joining forces .
there are , however , major differences in these two , despite a public reconciliation .
the key to the problem is syria , which moscow has recently aligned itself to the role of the author , but the peace with russia and turkey support opposing sides .
it may be significant that in almost three hours after the initial discussions , the presidents told the press that they were not even addressed the issue .
the turkish president has avoided consciously responding to the question regarding their their differences , while putin chose to highlight them .
there is no clear consensus as to where they can find common ground in syria .
in the months after the open hostility , and taking into account the possibility of a full-blown disaster for nato-member turkey &apos;s stability when firing down russian combat aircraft , it is surely better that the two leaders are again not even on speaking terms .
royal bank of scotland lost to scotland from external customers
the president and ceo of the bank according to the rbs brand will be reduced back-office role .
royal bank of scotland lost to scotland from external customers .
ross mcewan told the bbc the commercial that the rbs brand joined the bank &apos;s international objectives .
then , when the bank almost collapsed eight years ago , and it had to save , it has given up on these objectives .
the bank &apos;s strategists have used this time to &apos; rbs &apos; -brand to protect the other kuluttajarahoitusbrändejä .
it support millions of pounds used in the international sport sponsorship of the six nations-rugby in wimbledon champion andy murrayhin .
but now it is considered correct to give kansallisempien brands to come to the fore .
the royal bank of scotland is on the scottish with the customers , but it is not started again from the beginning .
in england and wales , all the references to the päätoimistoa and the ( rbs ) stock exchange listings , with the exception of the natwestiksi is amended as follows : .
ulster bank-the brand is already in use on the east coast of ireland and northern ireland .
there are other , smaller yksityispankkitoiminnan brands , which are getting more visibility : coutts , adam &amp; holt &apos;s military bank , drummond and co .
mcewania interviewed guests and staff of the round in inverness-shiressa .
he told the bbc the commercial : &quot; the rbs brand will be sijoittajabrändimme and our employees the employer , because we will be now a lot more brands on the bank . &quot;
when the bank itself became a global brand , rbs : stä became a global brand .
i say , therefore , that we no longer have global goals , we have the local goals .
each of these brands means something very different in their communities , and our staff works with clients on these brands below .
rbs has already stated that it will not resume the six nations-sponsorship , and it has raised the profile of the urheilusponsoroinnissaan of the different brands .
&quot; now is the time for us to move in the direction of the bank , because in essence , brands ( we asked ) the question is , how can we concentrate on making this better for the bank , &quot; the ceo said .
three years ago i would have been a very cynical , if we had said that we &apos;re going to have a great bank customers and offered these brands .
but what we have done with the work focused on their customers &apos; needs , not ours , i think , that you can see a lot of changes .
we can bring those brands back , so i think that the time is right .

sergei ivanov , the chief of staff of russia &apos;s putin tell
russian president vladimir putin has unexpectedly dismissed chief of staff , sergei ivanov .
ivanov has been part of putin &apos;s trusted insider for many years to come .
63-year-old has now appointed a special representative for the environment and transport .
in the opinion of the kremlin said that putin has &quot; ordered by the presidential administration of russia ivanov to move away from the duties of the director of &quot; , but this was not given a reason .
ivanov , deputy director , starting in 2012 , anton persecution , has been named his successor .
hunt , 44 , is a former diplomat .
he was born in the estonian capital of tallinn , in 2012 , graduated from the prestigious moscow state institute of international relations institute ( mgimo ) and the tokyo embassy .
later , he led the presidential protocol and government personnel , says the kremlin &apos;s website ( in russian ) .

i think that the most important task of the administration is to support you in your efforts as a head of state , as regards the implementation of the laws drafting as well as the ohjeistuksienne .
putin told the russian tv station on friday that ivanov was asked to leave the place and recommended that the persecution be appointed in his place .
are the smiles of convincing ?
this is a business that has perplexed moscow .
sergei ivanov has long been one of vladimir putin &apos;s closest allies , and , like putin , the security service , the soviet kgb serves .
esikuntapäällikkönä he was one of the country &apos;s most influential men .
state television to show the meeting with putin , the two men argued that the chief of staff of the retired the side on his own request .
but despite the hymyilystä cameras , only a few people here are convinced-especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
or is this just some sort of power struggle will swell ?
no one yet knows .
but the official claim that the man , which once advertised on the potential presidential candidate , wants to suddenly lead to russia &apos;s environmental policy has been really skeptical .
the kremlin website in the comments from putin , ivanov said the loan &quot; , it is true that early in 2012 , i asked you for four years , with the responsibility for this in the debate to very complex , too bad we don &apos;t have even to say the italian guardia di finanza , the task .

when putin came to power , he cited ivanov as one of the five people that he trusted the most .
once it was thought that ivan doors could come after the second period , president putin of russia , as putin the third season would have been unconstitutional .

1.35 € billion the project is expected to be ready by may £ 2017
engineers have joined the north queensferry &apos;s crossing of the deck , and were left behind , which means that the bridge now extends to fife .
it is the first of four non-proliferation , &quot; the cover of viuhkojen &quot; , who are now being completed around each of the three pillars of the bridge .
the bridge is now a share of the 600-meter-long fifesta and weighs in at 30 000 tonnes .
it is 10 000 tons of steel and 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 harusköyttä .
1.35 € billion the project is expected to be ready by may £ 2017 .
economy minister keith brown visited the site today and was among the first to walking along the land bridge .

all in all , almost 79 % of the bridge deck is now in place and the lid of the last leg of the concrete cover is cast into today &apos;s rosythissa , which means that the size of the cover is ready to withdraw in place of the bridge .
michael martin , the head of the project , the bridge constructors-fort crossing , said : &quot; the first shut-off in any of the bridge project is always a major milestone .
in this fantastic project , this shut-off represents the tip of the building technology .
when the last of the tiekannen share of an ever-expanding to the north pole was installed and connected to the tiekanteen , we had to then close the remaining part of the inland north , or to the power side .
this was done by dragging the north road by an earth bank to 700 mm in the direction of the south .
this was a huge and , at the same time very demanding action .
a huge , because the viaduct is 222 m long , weighs about 6000 tonnes and it had to pull about 3 % inclination angle .
demanding , because the tolerances , according to which the team worked , were very small , only a few millimeters in each direction .
fortunately , however , all went well .
rescue moelfre bay : three of the men are &quot; fortunate when he was alive &quot;
the three men are &quot; fortunate when he was alive , &quot; then , when they were fishing in front of he continues to anglesey .
moelfre rnli lifeboat station , made the alarm at 13.20 ( bst ) on friday after the crew saw the event developing in moelfre bay .
the three men tried desperately to swim to safety in their boat as they continue forward on her own .

pokémon go is a respectable health and happiness of the hunting
it is fascinating to see how the world is changing .
over the past decade , many people didn &apos;t worry too much about it , that teenagers and children no longer go out to play , but that they would rather spend their free time monitors by looking at .
pokémon go get people to get up from the couch and to participate in one of the activities .
the display of the time was limited initially to a tv , video games , and now more recently smartphones .
it is so amazing to see that the technology and the outdoor-activity are not mutually exclusive .
i am referring , of course , villitykseen called pokémon go . an application that is based on the characters , which was originally developed in the 1990 &apos; s video games ( later on of them was born in the animated television series , playing cards and other downstream products ) .
like many pop-culture phenomena , its popularity was down to some extent prior to the adoption of this new game &apos;s release in the united states , australia and new zealand early in july .
after the game &apos;s release was postponed by delays in other countries , because of the huge popularity of the ylikuormitti servers .
only the number of pokémon golla was more than tinderillä and almost as much as twitter .
how it works ?
in a nutshell , explained the älypuhelimiaan in search of players using the wild pokemon are traced with gps , and that after the discovery of the &quot; photograph &quot; ( phone screenshot ) , or &quot; captured &quot; .
the generation that played the game at a younger age , is associated with villitykseen and jumped up from the couch , i &apos;m looking for work .
in the united states the game has resulted in a significant increase in &quot; the average member &quot; in daily increments .
apple watch-application the cardiogram , which tracks the 35 000 users , reported recently in the washington post , that the two days of the release of the game for 30 minutes a day of moving the number of people in the 45 % to 53 % of the cardiogramin will be jumped on the consumers .
the company does not know who play pokémon gota , it sees only the training level of the information .
many of the calls by public health campaigns &quot; to find 30 &quot; , &quot; get off the couch &quot; and &quot; not active every day , &quot; have not produced any result to the fact that the majority of public health warnings is a tedious and they care about the people who appear to be unfortunate .
the importance of physical activity , however , can &apos;t be ignored .
on a regular basis on mobile is a lower risk of developing cancer or depression .
the activity helps weight control , high blood pressure and diabetes . the benefits are too many to mention here .
pokémon go subtlety is that it gets people to go out and do something that they will enjoy .
this will be covered by the three pillars of health : exercise , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun .
some people even get metsästäessään with new friends .
as a general rule , disapprove of the joy of the pila times looking for this things to complain about .
yes , anyone can walk your way around the door .
what about then ?
there has been a breakthrough .
even though in the past was the fitbitin-like applications , to monitor the activity , they did not give a reason for movement in the same way as this game .
novelty disappears and operating subsides in due course .
the pokemon &apos;s success will , however , other games that connect applications and virtual reality in a real-world activity , helping many people to be more active in hunting tunas , in better shape and healthier .

simone biles was caught by a gold medal in gymnastics moniottelussa

and now , in the end , the olympic champion .
the 19-year-old american gymnast reached moniottelun in the final of the world championship on thursday , leaving the gap between himself and raised in the olympic spotlight .
he kokonaispisteensä , the 62.198 , were clearly better than the silver mitalistin and the &quot; final five &quot; -team-mate aly raismanin and a mustafinan of the russian bronze medalist .

bilesista became the fourth american woman , which is subsequently won the moniottelun championship , and all in all , the fifth amerikkalaismestari . at the same time , he strengthened the reputation of his generation , and perhaps of all time , to be the best .
he broke out in tears as his final point was announced , and his long journey toward this moment .
this achievement to bring her in the same category in the best of the other generation of athletes , like michael phelps , who have brought a new level of its kind :
biles has dominated the sport for the past three years , winning 15 world championship medals , including 10 gold , programmes , with the ambition and the accuracy of the mixture has been so astounding that the 1984 olympic champion mary lou retton called her &quot; the best näkemäkseni voimistelijaksi &quot; .
the last test was waiting for brazil , the competition , which was not so much a question of biles and other competitors , but the burden of expectations between him and the over-sized .
return to the family home to a handful of gold medals of the texas springiin without it would have been a disappointment .

this is not a coincidence .
this girl , with her maternal grandparents adopted in a cowboy outfit , and that coach aimee boormanin mother found when the girl was a student on the way to the gym , where boorman coached , has become a powerhouse .
he has not been lost on the moniottelussa summer 2013 , and this winning streak is likely to continue as long as the biles wants .
although the head of the tournament after two rounds , had a small mustafina , it was just an illusion .
balance beam and floor exercises , with biles is a reigning world champion , were waiting .
he rose to the top of the boom points 15.433 and crossed them in the pit getting 15.933 .
raisman hugged her , when they were waiting for the final points-a mere formality , and the tears rose to bilesin glitterpunaisella , the white and the blue tack on the limited eye contact when , for which he once wrote a clip , came true .
raismanin performance was some sort of a revenge four years ago , when he was with shared third place , but lost the bronze to mustafinalle the jump-off .
this time , the 22-year-old platoon leader , which the americans refer to as &quot; called by some the &quot; , was clearly in the lead .

why do we need a simonea , gabbya and laurieta
thus an invitation to this year &apos;s women &apos;s olympic gymnastics team , for more than one reason .
first of all , i &apos;ve been on time since 1984 , the summer olympics , and the u.s. has never been so dominant .
and secondly , this team is involved in three voimistelijaa , simone biles , gabby douglas and lauren &quot; laurie &quot; hernandez , who have inspired many of the colored girls .
the composition of this team , that jewish aly raisman and catholic madison kocian are complementary , not all proud .
this team seems to have , at long last , america .
it has also established itself in the presence of women in the top of the dark-skinned and latin american species .
for the last four years , there has been notable as one of the most successful naisvoimistelija .
last year , simone and gabby were first and second .
this is awesome .
in the last olympics , olympic , and gabby douglas surprised america cheered .
now , the world has witnessed three times world champion simone bilesin , douglas and laurie hernandez incredible performance , in which they present the unexpected but masterly gymnastics programs .
on thursday , simonesta became the fourth american woman , which is subsequently won the individual gold in the women &apos;s moniottelussa .
and teammate aly raisman was awarded the silver medal .
we will see the peak of the species , but the situation does not seem that gymnastics halls across the country .
simone , gabby and laurie went on all the same path , as aly and madison in achieving the olympic team .
they are the &quot; final five &quot; ( the last five ) , as in the following olympics gymnastics team , there will be only four voimistelijaa , and this is the last year of the coach , marta karolyin .
the reality , however , is that gymnastics is an expensive sport , and gymnasts train , as a rule , private gymnastics clubs , which are maintained by the parents who pay for coaching , facilities , travel , uniforms , competition fees , hotel charges ( for coaches and their supporters , as well as to the families of the men &apos;s artistic gymnastics ) , and the list goes on .
a large part of the gymnastics clubs in the area are located in the affluent esikaupunkinaapurustoalueilla that can support the species .
these clubs gymnasts receive all the training , and this is an expensive and long-lasting commitment to the families of the gymnasts .
aimee boorman , simone bilesin coach , as well as maggie haney , laurie hernandez coach , are both nurtured urheilijoitaan since then , when they started gymnastics .
we need to bring more affordable and available to gymnastics coaching communities where living in s , gabbyn and laurien innostamat a significant number of young girls .
i set up a voimistelusäätiöni for 20 years ago .
järjestöissäni , we have been offering free and low-cost gymnastics in harlem for more than 15 000 kaupunkilaisnuorelle ( mainly in black and latinoille ) and we have nurtured national and international champions .
in september , we extend to detroit in order to provide a high level of gymnastics ( my hometown ) to young people , who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this remarkable olympialaislajista .
gymnasts develop body strength , flexibility and coordination , as well as the mind , hard work , discipline and determination .
this combination offers the benefits of good health for life , as well as school-and työmenestykselle .
this team &apos;s inspiration may be thousands of young girls to start gymnastics , and it is awesome .
sport is so important , especially for girls .
we live in an exciting time .
thanks to simone , aly , laurie , gabby and madison that you showed a serious &quot; girl power &quot; by winning the olympic team gold , and that the motivoitte are so many young girls from different backgrounds , to start on the road to a healthy , strong and prosperous young people divorce .

because information on the effectiveness and safety of ticagrelorin-in particular as regards the bleeding risk-more than a three-year time periods are limited , the draft guidelines do not recommend treatment for a longer period of time , as this period of time .

the incident occurred on tuesday afternoon .
davidson added : &quot; from what i understood , that the staff apparently tried to remove clothing from the sale of a woman &apos;s left , which is all well and good . &quot;

this way you can defend itself against armed attacks krav magaa using
the world is a dangerous , but in this video you can make about the dailymail , a little safer for you .
we talked about the new york city living with the krav maga federation , the grand master of the rhon mizrachi , to see how to deal with heiluttelevia to be stained with the looters .
we were coming to you then the front or back , this video will show you how you can pay the attacker at the same time .
mizrachi , if you approached from behind , first must turn , so that you can see the hyökkääjäsi and &quot; raivaat came on the line . &quot;
after you grab the gun in the forearm and shoulder , before you hit the attacker in the face with a free kyynärpäälläsi .
continue striking at the knee in the groin , and when the attacker goes to double up in pain , twist the gun in his hands , hit him in the face with the butt of a gun and going back on this , keeping the gun pointed at him .
if armed with a person approaching from the front , the technology is the same : remove your body came from , grab your weapon and turn it around so that the criminal will not be able to launch .
put the weight of the firearm , and at the same time hit the aggressor in the chest , then twist the gun from his grasp , backed away from , and then click her with a gun .
does this sound difficult ?
see how he finished , exactly , does this .
but keep in mind that if you &apos;re not a krav maga &apos;s grand master , the safest way out of the robbery is to give up your money .
bed and ian wright for the european likaisimpia places to nuoleskelee tour
a british tourist has set a serious challenge to the immuunijärjestelmällensä and oksennusrefleksillensä likaisimmista and yököttävimmistä up by licking some of the european places .

before each item in the nuolaisemista he took the photo himself and us to show the situation of the metre , which he was getting into .
the trial , which was a movie called the inner strength to the trail , however , yielded surprising results .
the idea of a train that is used by thousands of people in the flushing button nuolaisemisesta may seem completely repulsive , but in fact the hotel was awful in the kitchen is more of a bad bacteria .
on his way through europe wright spoke of the constant doctors and medical professionals in the intestinal flora and her for their own health .
fortunately , none of his nuolemansa is not left him more a bad taste in the mouth .
wrightista became well known around the world , his travel to the bowel movement was documented over the sustainability of the tester and while eating some strange and wonderful things .
this public railway stations converted from the toilet seat flush button extends actually tested his immuunijärjestelmäänsä .
in , he said : &quot; from childhood i have been rather carefree in terms of their health , and i have put in my mouth all sorts of things from the soil , worms and kuraisesta out of the water . &quot;
indeed , he confirmed his reputation as a film .
the only thing , which she refused , was filthy russian public tv .
his näytteessään was a unit of more than 4000 metres. photosynthesis
in comparison , the vastapestyjen hand reading should be less than 60 .
but in one of the russian public is equiped he refused to nuolaisemaan , when the outcome seemed more than 4000 units of foto metres , and vastapestyjen of the hands , the result is less than 60 .
wright has produced a traveler &apos;s movie , the inner strength on the track , together with the finnish dairy , diet , too . the film will be the number of bacteria in different places , such as in the bathroom .
carbon monoxide in the film said : &quot; this is just about the worst thing that i &apos;ve smelled in the toilet . &quot;
there is no it dirtier !
i &apos;m not going to count one &apos;s anything , because here is the unpopular repulse .
the inner strength to the trail was produced together with the finnish dairy , diet , too .
the company offered a gefilusta committee on wrightille , which contains lactic acid bacteria , as well as ( c ) and ( d ) , who will help to improve the human intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
eating snacks , juice and the leader of the new categories of niko vuorenmaa said : &quot; we wanted to really provide consumers with something new .
something that would be fascinating to look at , and which at the same time , would explain the probiotic benefits .
heittelimme up in the air a lot of crazy ideas , and we came up with the idea of &apos; soitetaanpa &#91; 25 &#93; somerhalder &apos; . &quot;
they claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon .
instead of just talking about the products , we wanted to set them in a larger context : tell the everyday environment of good and bad bacteria , intestinal health , the importance of the relationship , as well as its immune system .
the growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon , and this documentary allows us an interesting way to tell more about it to consumers .
i think that the document also shows that there is a great sense of humor !
director tom h added : &quot; let &apos;s say it now while this way : if ian would have licked some of the things he asked for details , such as the one in the movie , i would have lost my respect for the unpopular repulse russian for him . &quot;
understandably , some of the nuoltavista was easier to &#91; 25 &#93; somerhalder , while the part was pretty difficult .
i &apos;m glad that we got to the part about those dirty nuolaisuista saved . &quot;
84 % of the diet in the year 2015 , doing survey respondents combined lactic acid bacteria specific to the abdomen and intestines , and 58 percent said that they , at least , between the use of the products , which have been added to the lactic acid bacteria .

vinyl destination : who actually buy albums ?
the solitary , middle aged men love to vinyyleitä .
before you rush to fill in the comment section of the negation of the ärtyneillä , a writer is the name of the character eikaikkiyksinäisetkeski-ikäisetmiehet , please note that this argument is based on real data .
yougovin according to the much-discussed new disks is not due to the fact that more and more of the physical objects in this millennium , the charm of novelty , born would be enough , but the average age of the kaihosta .
apparently they are in the near future , which bought the vinyl disk , are most likely to be 45-54 years of age or older .
in fact , all likely disks will buy 18-24 age .
it is not a question of not only amateurs , but it includes a sense of the importance of the collection , the : the parents are more likely to keep their feelings inside vinyylien buyers a little bit ( 56 % vs 53 % ) and 69 % versus 66 % ) shall attempt ( .
but whether the results of the yougovin is true ?
if this blog would be a television news report , the camera would follow me , when i &apos;m walking in the middle of a busy street in soho , wearing my modest gray suit . pysähtyisin , muodostaisin viittoilisin busy before the cup with my hands , and i &apos;d say something authoritative , such as : &quot; let us examine the matter further . &quot;
let us examine the matter further .
at the same time , when the soho charm and dirt slow delete-hotels , chain restaurants and stores , as well as office supply stores are now in the buildings , which in the past was the independent movements-a handful of great specialized record shops .
the following section will probably ask for the camera to stop filming for a few moments , when i &apos;m standing very close to a variety of men in some of these stores when trying to evaluate the observation of their age and the feeling of temperamenttiaan .
i am told by stuart , 55 , which i follow sister raysta ( count : two young women , three middle-aged men ) reckless records ( counter : eight middle-age men , one a woman , most likely kaksissakymmenissä ) , to spend the night up to the london meeting , and walks around the shops up for a few hours .
i ask , whether he is a collector .
&quot; i guess i am , &quot; he says .
i have about 3000 or 4000 .
these plates , which are shown in the picture above ( he sent a sample of the email , i followed him home ) , covering his walls with kinect ™ .
the reason for such a huge number of the disk and the acquisition is , in part , the result of a single of his available income : now he can buy the discs , which he could not afford when they were originally released , and he will be able to buy again those that he sold when he was young and penniless .
&quot; a large part of the ostamastani material is the late 60 &apos; s and early 70 &apos; s , the discs , which were published when was 11 or 12 , i was probably a little bit with the acquisition of too young , &quot; she says .
he agrees that the disks buyers are more likely to be introvertteja , who enjoy their own company , and adds : &quot; i don &apos;t smoke and i don &apos;t drink much .
this is my vice . &quot;
the 25-year-old wez , who works at a sister rayssa , also believes that many of his customers agree to be made aware of the yougovin profile .
however , he has noticed a new wave of people , which the media enthusiasm is affected . people who have heard that the boards have come back into fashion and has become a need to buy the old album .
on the basis of the discussions people are removed from my collection in general in 1998 or 1999 .
customers who sold their vinyl to buy cds , sell now to buy the cd album back , &quot; he says .
this can be explained by an increase in the number of a particular age vinyyliheränneiden .
but what about the discs , the alleged sense of meaning ?
a phonican in the shop takes a few seconds to realize that the record stores offer lohdullisen community samanhenkisille types .
wezin according to some older customers have been injured , in particular lähimaksujärjestelmästä .
some vinyl fans can häkeltyä the digital world and to choose to trust the stability of familiar album covers ; objects that evoke memories of the teenage days of happiness .
&quot; i think that sometimes it can be in the case of a gap or some kind of lohdusta , and objects of ownership creates a &quot; , wez says .
himself a hunter-gatherer i must admit that this is true , and i believe it to be true for many people .
it is an easy way to fill out the thoughts .
&quot; we are like their sosiaalityöntekijöitään ! &quot; another employee said a sudden disk stack .
huhtikuullinen , an opinion poll carried out by icm , that almost 50 % of the people who had bought the vinyl disc in the previous month , had not yet listened to it .
the poll also found that 41 % of the record player , which they will never use , while 7 % of vinyyleitä ostavista there is no disc in the player .
at this point , the news report is likely to look like a serious looking worried while navigating the bossa nova collection .
this is a wake-up call , &quot; the prize &quot; -a perspective is something that also sounds of the universessa ( counter : three middle-age men ) working in jonny , 42 , has noticed .
&quot; someone came a little while ago , and said : &apos; i do not have a turntable , but i would like to purchase radiohead &apos;s album , so we can put it on the back burner &apos; , &quot; he says .
this is not a high percentage , but it definitely happens .
more product , less music .
we visit people who say : &quot; i do not have a record player . &quot;
not older , but younger people , the myöhäisteini , who have just innostumassa it .
foppissa , which is now almost an entire floor reserved for vinyyleille , is a much more versatile when i arrive in the audience .
seitsemänkymppisiä couples , tourists taking photos , teen boys and middle-aged women .
although the atmosphere is less casual than it used to be in the stores in the most recent speakers wild beastin syntikan raikaa-and seksintäyteinen pop and improvisation of jazz-it &apos;s great to see a wide variety of clients .
none of them seem particularly lonely , but have nagging psychological trauma is difficult to prove by standing on someone else &apos;s next to 30 seconds .
elanora , 27 , has walked around the foppia a few minutes of your time looking at the different types of discs .
he is doing window shopping , is not kuluttamassa much money .
he will tell you , that earn much , so picking disk is not really an option .
&quot; it is expensive .
it is easy to listen to the music , either on the computer or something else , but vinyl beauty is ... &quot; he sighs rakastuneesti .
&quot; i do not know how to explain-it is really unique . &quot;
the last stop on the place it is said to have aroused new vinyylinrakastajien generation : urban outfitters .
at the same time , when i try to , it seems , that i shall look into the denim shorts , i scrutinized the group of teenage girls , who gather for a moment the polaroid cameras around , before the father and daughter are considering crosleyn turntable .
on the left is the staircase , that wall is adele , jeff buckley &apos;s , amy winehousen and covered with fleetwood mac disks : a mix of contemporary music and the classics , the essential of any keskivertokokoelman .
no one will see them-perhaps because they are the only decorations , and some are so high that it would be impossible for the circuits .
this is a purely &quot; vinyls &quot; .
but in view of the fact that these objects by the slightest attention can mean more money for the industry and send a few customers in the depths of soho to get some more , this is not much to complain about .
does not come as a surprise that the it sector of the population , who are more likely to have more time and money , it is also a fact , that use the most luxury items , such as vinyyleihin .
but even if the results of the löydökseni suggest that the yougovin are accurate , at least in the soho neighborhood record stores , they do not rule out that a large number of collectors and lovers of female vinyylien , that there are tosimaailmassa , record stores and online forums .
these people probably are working hard at school or in the office .
they certainly do not spend thursday aamujaan maleksimalla around berwick street record stores selaten and evasiveness , eerily , 30-year-old tekotelevisiojuontajan while looking into this unsuspecting middle aged men &apos;s shoulders .

bike thieves tormented by great cities worst hit turku-view your situation
bike thieves tormenting the worst big cities in finland to turku , finland .
there is this year , stolen in proportion to the number of inhabitants more bikes than the other nine largest city .
the new york times explained on the basis of the reported the theft to the police , the number of ten-wheel in january-august this year , stolen bikes and parts per 1000 inhabitants .
in addition to the top of the rose of turku , helsinki , oulu and lahti .
they took place , according to the information of the police four or five bike theft per 1000 inhabitants .
instead , the city of espoo and in the police were informed only about two bike theft per 1000 inhabitants .
after all , it &apos;s a big difference .
&quot; in other cities occurs in proportion to the number of population as compared to the other theft in a double &quot; , characterized by the police board , the police inspector tommy sleigh .
the turku police wonder why the city is a comparison of the top spot .
it is extremely difficult to say why in turku has been stolen more bikes than the rest .
i don &apos;t have an answer to it .
&quot; the incidence of theft can affect it , how much in is navigated by using the wheels and bikes is at all &quot; , says sergeant teemu kumar s .
police described the government when you expect it to , that tommi sleigh turku , helsinki and oulu are rising to the top of the comparison .
bike theft amounts go largely depending on what are the study and cycling cities .
turku is a city center , short distances and a lot of bikes available to thieves .
&quot; for example , london is , in turn , quite a different type of city , where the city centers are distant from each other and the bike is not necessarily the primary navigation tool , &quot; green says .
to the attention of the police , the whole finland in january-august is to become a little less than the corresponding period of the last year of bike theft .
great joy is not yet due .
in spite of the decline in the last few years the police becomes aware of a little over 20 000 bike theft each year .
it means 50-60 fillaria every day and only in helsinki , about 4 000 bikes a year .
&quot; those are big numbers , &quot; green says .
in reality , the thieves will take more , because that is the only part of the victims , announced the theft to the police .
green calls on the people to make a police report bike theft , while fewer than one in ten of the police declared the case survives .
a typical cleared bike theft is one in which a police officer is informed of the theft immediately and the thief is caught in flagrante delicto .
&quot; in the context of the rest of the investigation will be revealed in the cases , when , for example , the drug case of the apartment can be found in the stolen bikes , &quot; green says .
in helsinki , the bike thieves get caught on a weekly basis in the act or in the course of the investigation of police , says senior constable timo leppä m .
according to him , the bikes are stolen , for example , trade centres , bike gear , bike sisäpihoilta , stocks and cellars or in practice , anywhere , where it is usually kept .
individual bike models the most stolen in previous years , the jopoja .
u-lock give the bike better protection than many other forms of lock .
some thieves take the wheel , for example , short for their exclusive use , but a large part of the stolen bikes will end up for sale , for example , via the internet .
they will remain in the domestic market .
&quot; at least not to the attention of the police , has not come to my attention that the stolen bikes would go a little overseas , &quot; green says .
according to the police , the stolen bike buyers are common in finnish .
part of the buying probably stolen bicycle without knowing it .
part of it can be about any doubts .
used bicycle buyer should be careful , because he may be guilty of concealment of an offence or misconduct .
&quot; alarm bells should be ringing , if in good condition bikes sold in clear below cost , &quot; green says .
the position of the colourful nopsansa erikoiskirjastovirkailija severi deer every working day for the rock shelter of the library in helsinki .
the bikes he has had five songs , but none has been stolen , hart says . &quot; there has never been , is visited by a good monk . &quot;

helsinki kallio , the kiosk promptly locked the bikes with a little shopped ali valve u-lock .
now bike huddled near the kiosk up against the wall , but usually the valve locks the wheel to one of the flat-rate , such as a bike rack .

&quot; all the time will hear from friends that the bikes are exported . &quot;
&quot; mostly bad bikes , r-jopoja &quot; .

such are the rio audience : games are not glued together around the boxes , but the finnish mobile application of interest
normally , sports games are displayed in the tv katsojatilastoissa is surrounde by the sharp mountain .
rio &apos;s olympics have not so far reached huge audiences .
at a time the games are around 12 percent of the population of the glued boxes at its best : tuesday night &apos;s swimming olympic channel tv2 at the same time , followed by a rejected 615 000 spectators .
for the sake of comparison : a month ago : the athletics european championships were almost 800 000 viewers , tv2 &apos; s table at a time and the football european championships well another million .
so far , interest in the olympic types the most is the sunday-night cycling and the fifth race of the day opened up artistic gymnastics , both of which reached the olympic channel at a time , almost half a million viewers .
yle sport chief panu pokkinen is pleased with the ratings , and recalls that the rio for the olympics for the first time , viewers are divided into several different media .
following the olympic games , in addition to the finnish tv rio .
we are pleased to see how much of the tv-viewers in general will choose the olympic games .
on the television side , the viewers are divided into tv2 and the nyt fem-channels .
rio &apos;s olympics are the first sports games , which the nyt has dedicated an entire channel .
when the broadcast is going 24 hours a day , and viewers have all the time in 20 000 to 500 000 , so it is a good base .
crowds are smaller than at the 2012 london games or the world cup in beijing in 2008 , but the difference between explain in part the time difference-a large part of the rio race broadcasts will be in finland , the night-time .
another reason to dilute interest in the now-if someone from flat to keep-it is certainly a traditional finnish the reason : if finland would have taken the interest of someone else &apos;s surprise of the games with a medal , it would be pompsahtanut up .
in addition , the track is only the beginning , as well as other types of finnish interest : sailing and horseback riding .
according to pokkisen , close to the beginning of the viewership has been higher than expected .
when a track begins , the audience explode .
yle launched for yle rio 2016-the first days of the world cup , which went up for apple &apos;s app store for finland immediately became one of the free application .
monday by an application was loaded in the 150 000 times .
just a wild guess , that now goes for around 200 000 of the download .
&quot; the network ratings we get until later . &quot; , pokkinen says
the rio arena has not been working for all users as wanted .
pokkinen says that feedback has come and the bugs have been fixed .
the use of the rio arena , has been associated with delay and other small technical problem in the early stages .
updated versions of the applications have been received , which should fix the errors .
the rio olympic games appear more widely rejected and arena than any other sporting event ever in the past .
yle fem-can follow some of the species , and on the radio yle speech convey the races on a daily basis .
the olympic games are not only may työläimmät some ever , also the last , that you can keep track of only the rejected channels .
from 2018 olympic sports shows , as well as at yle that the commercial channels .
how deep is the deepest lake in finland ?

more than 80 meters range from lake saimaa , toisvesi and p .
they have not been studied as well as the päijännettä .
in particular , the base of the lake inari is not mapped .
&quot; there could very well be unfamiliar to the deep basins &quot; , kannela says .
if the deepest lake is defined as the average depth , it is a great jukajärvi , 23 meters .
in this way , the lake päijänne does not reach the top ten of the deepest ranks and suvasvesi is still further from the tip .
repair 12 . august at 14.29 : corrected the last paragraph , in which the average depth in the deepest lakes were wrong .

british economists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of staying in the eu .

economists were shocked when their voice was not part of the .
they were shocked when the economy is the most important issue of the policy also saw .
economic curly language
the centre for the last month kyselyssään macroeconomics profession insist answers brexit-a recipe for disaster .
the most typical response is that the economists , because this time , the voters made their decision other than on economic grounds .
one of the economists explained the loss of economic status is , that people understand the economy .
in many ways , still is the idea that the number of jobs is independent of the number of those in work , almost a standard .
if an immigrant get a job , it is a right-to-britiltä .
many also have the perception that the fall in the value of the currency would be a good thing , because it contributes to the export industry .
in the opinion of the voters in the economist , did not believe the economic arguments , because economists &apos; consensus does not become enough of a raise .
kismitti , in particular , to the bbc , equity in them , which gave the same amount of space on the only pair from the economist , the representative of the eu-is the difference between % those of economists as the vast majority .

migration is the economy

the immigrant will take your work , an immigrant , is clogging up sairaalasi , take advantage of you .
these arguments in the smart .
each of the coffee shop are foreign workers .
how many more jobs in britain would be if they leave out ?
each health centre in the waiting room can see the immigrants .
how much more the british get the doctor , if they are not to be ?
each school has a maahanmuuttajienkin of the children .
how much easier to correct that british children of the saisivatkaan school on , if they get rid of ?
each municipality is home to foreigners .
how much more space in the early residents would be if they leave quickly ?
i think these are economic issues .
they apply to jobs , housing and public services .
economists do not , however , been able to meet them , and if you were , their responses are received .
economists have not managed to explain that , thanks to british immigrants , there are more jobs , less health care and more money for education and social security .

aberdeen real estate fund prepared for brexitiin cash
one of the funds was the aberdeen asset management , which is responsible for the real estate investments in a finnish pertti v .
according to him , at the expense of aberdeen in time for brexitiin by ( a ) and ( b ) the plans .
plan b or the eu-is the difference between a profitable camp victory began to be prepared in more detail a few weeks before the vote , in the event that the result would be to leave .
the concern was that investors would begin to pull their funds out of the markkinalta .
real estate funds is normally not a significant liquid assets , but now they could be necessary .
we departed to increase cash reserves .
when brexit it came to 23. day , we had 25 % of the fund &apos;s assets in cash investments or likvideissä , vanhanen says aberdeen &apos;s only open daily noteerattavasti real estate fund , which is in the news .
vanhanen &apos;s second cabinet , according to normaalitaso would be 15-20 % .
the value of the fund at the time was 3.5 billion pounds .
the total value of the company &apos;s funds , is about 20 billion pounds .
it was the highest number of nine in an open real estate fund , open to all uk property funds , vanhanen says the real estate funds .
he estimates that the number of these funds at the lowest cash stayed in the top ten percent or even less .
real estate funds , therefore , to be prepared by the brexitiin very different strategies .
funds closed their trading
when the eu-is the difference between a profitable camp won , europe went haywire .
the real estate market the vote followed less than two weeks , however , were quite peaceful , vanhanen says .
then two things happened that changed the situation .
the first was the president of the bank of england executive director mark carneyn , where he estimates that players in the commercial real estate brexit can be a big risk .
in addition , real estate funds first , standard life , froze the trade .
these together with the ryöpäyttivät of the situation and brought the matter to the financial times and the bbc headlines .
as soon as the situation was compared to the years 2007 and 2008 , vanhanen said .
this made investors nervous .
institutional investors remained rauhallisempina , but private investors hermoilivat .
snow ball began to spin , and the fund after another was forced to close its doors .
aberdeen &apos;s situation was good because of the cash collected , but that , too , was forced in the end to freeze trade for a period of six days .
vanhanen &apos;s second cabinet , they are not actually closed , but changed their pricing down .
in practice , the investors were given him time to reflect on whether it is worth the money now to pull in a panic to get out .
aberdeen &apos;s message was that if you are not now obliged to take some money out of it , it is not advisable , since it would create losses .
it calmed the situation , and for the most part , withdrew its notification .
after been quite steady , and now the market has been in a couple of weeks of very quiet , vanhanen says .
he points out that , for example , in aberdeen &apos;s continental europe-funds has not been anything like a pumice stone .
however , a lot of the queries came from .
an inordinate amount of attention to the real estate funds
vanhanen &apos;s second cabinet believes that the real estate funds of visits , the closures were an inordinate amount of attention .
open funds , which closes on , is dominated by around 4 % of the uk &apos;s property .
aberdeen &apos;s shut-off took six days , and the company sold out of from 80 to less than ten properties in london , a dishonorable estate for one .
some of the other funds are still closed .
aviva investors warned its this week that it may keep the fund closed the year 2017 .
at the moment , there is uncertainty and economic growth forecasts is reivattu down , but the situation does not look for the &quot; hurjemmalta &quot; of aberdeen .
the biggest issues for the future development of the economy of the british public now .
in spite of the uncertainty of the situation is brought to the part of the kiinteistösijoittajista up to new possibilities , vanhanen points out .
the pound and the dollar exchange rate is at its worst in 30 years , with the addition of the market there is a 15 percent discount sale brexit-vote to the previous time .
dollariostaja can now buy the same property by as much as 30 % lower price .
there is a lot of willing buyers , vanhanen said .
brexit brought the minuses in the london real estate market
two in the morning , the situation did not seem very kummoiselta .
but the four , when the real estate fund , aberdeen asset management had a talent for real estate investments in pertti v woke up again to take a look at the results of the vote , brexit-the situation was different .
the power of sanahan it .
i realized that this goes now plan b &apos;s side of second homes , vanhanen said in helsinki .
he headed immediately to work .
the city of london was already fully alive in the morning .
the office normally muted the tv boxes provided for in tuuttasivat news , and usually loud crowd hiljentyi fully listen to , when prime minister david cameron came in the morning in front of the camera to tell the resignation .
when the market opened , the display screens flashing the just plain red .
it was the kind of morning you would never have thought to live , martin says .
in spite of the turbulence is not and also because , in aberdeen , one of the uk &apos;s largest real estate funds , the finishing touches on the brexit-the day after the vote , namely to boost the two real estate trade .
the atmosphere was chaotic .
the company , however , was provided for in the option well , and that &apos;s why it was kind of a quiet , vanhanen says .
brexit-voting started a repair shop
the vote was followed by a storm .
the pound collapsed , the british leadership went to the exchange .
the market began to anticipate sweeping bills to the british and , in particular , the london real estate market .
the london offices were anticipated in the coming years , up to 20 % of the minuses .
soon a group of british real estate funds began to freeze trade one after the other .
aberdeenkin did so for six days .
now the storm has subsided , but the air jyllää more and more uncertainty .
it does not however appear in the last summer vacation days this week in helsinki have spent on the face of vanhanen &apos;s second cabinet .
in his opinion , there is still far too early to say much about what brexitistä follow .
so much is still open : how a difference occurs , and how scotland reacted to this situation , about for example .
the development of the real estate market in london has already been ensitietoja .
real estate service company cbre corporate governance information on price developments will cover about a third of the market .
according to them , all london &apos;s real estate prices dropped by 3.3 per cent from june to july .
the city of london was 6.1 % of the office buildings of the minuses , v lists .
the figures are not so terrible , but they are monthly changes .
the monthly index was published in 1987 , and only five months have been worse figures , vanhanen said .
all the same they hit crisis in years 2007 and 2008 .
it is interesting because the brexitiä were compared with the fall of lehman &apos;s and the united states very quickly , which began in the real estate market to the global economic crisis .
vanhanen &apos;s second cabinet believes that the analogy is not quite the right word , because this is britain &apos;s home-made crisis .
enville hall is another .
the real estate market is not seen as of the time of panic selling but a willingness to sell in order to improve the liquidity , vanhanen said .
funding can be found in the usually .
correction could be in front of that case ,
in fact , the price of the repair business is not about her wonder-one could have been in front of the air brexitiäkin .
according to aberdeen , london and other world &apos;s number one urban real estate prices have been too high for many years .
we have been saying for two years , the offices of the city and , in particular , are overpriced , vanhanen said .
the drop-down , then , started to really high .
london prices are almost caught up up for four reasons , vanhanen mailing list .
the british economy has grown strongly in the london population as well .
another big trend is that buildings are the last ownership category , which is becoming increasingly global , vanhanen said .
in the middle-east and asia has become the new players on the market , and more and more institutions and establishments , investors are looking for real estate investments from abroad .
london is known as an easy target .
in addition , the prices have been fueled by low interest rates , which is why , for example , pension companies have been looking for returns on new items .
on top of this loan has been easily available-although the leverage is used , according to mr vanhanen &apos;s now clearly less than the 2008 crisis during the preceding boom .
hajauttakaa , hajauttakaa
in london , the rise in prices tasautui last summer , martin says .
aberdeenkin began to lighten their holdings in london , and was last year a net seller .
to be expected was some sort of a tipping point , and now , it came to be .
what do we go from here ?
it depends on how the uk economy evolves , vanhanen said .
much of the future , he does not dare to judge , but says that any increase in spike is unlikely to have the permit .
the atmosphere suggests that in the face of a falling or steady .
vanhanen has seen a number of movements up and down , as he has been in the real estate industry since 1988 .
and still he is an optimist who believes that in the culture medium to be overcome .
if you are prepared for the risks very well , is in a better position .
he thinks globally .
if you have invested in a single market , it is too much of it to the victim .
if there is a decentralised , the risks are also distributed , vanhanen said .
s-group start to register your shopping information , more

the coach &apos;s battle against cancer was driven by helen glover and heather stanningin rowing to victory
these games will not be feelings of appalling that , in gold , and it really means something .
from the first to the last snapshot , 220 hard kiskaisua toward the history books , helen glover and heather stanning found the golden moment of estacio da lagoalla a deeper meaning .
although they entered together , the boat was three votes . coach robin williams was present in all the time , when the second consecutive olympic gold in women &apos;s coxless pairs kiisi a couple of the race-the first women in british sporting history in the books for such a thing to have achieved .
their control was perfect , and it was their 39. appearance in the voittamattomina , which is also record levels .
this , what we can see , the two great athletes from liitämässä on the surface of the swan sulokkuudella , does not reflect the nature of the victory .
each rowing gold in the background is a group of helpful hand pairs that contribute gradually to those things that make a difference . and none of the pair was less essential than the coach , which is 30 months ago , after receiving a cancer diagnosis did not know eläisikö he to this day .
as he said , the situation was delicate .
i had bladder cancer , which is one of the issues with inoperable , and they carried out the surgery .
if they do not intersect , it is spreading everywhere .
the situation could have been pretty bad .
it changes a little thinking .
williams received the diagnosis in december 2013 .
the trio was lucky in the fact that it was possible to start at the beginning of 2014 , his care outside of the period , in which case they caused as little-if the expression may ever use these sorts of situations .
i had to get a salary , so i had to heal quickly .
it encouraged me .
i was in the hospital and i was walking around the department to 20 , 30 , 50 feet at a time , when they said that a few step would be enough .
so it began .
rowing in itself is a journey , but it makes it a little bigger .
immediately after the victory of the first couple of thoughts was williams , who had been nervous in the morning , and he had talked about a little bit more than usual , trying to deal with their own hermostustaan .
stanning , captain of the regiment of the royal artillery of the mission in afghanistan , an experienced , said : &quot; i &apos;ve been feeling r this week , which might be a bit of an overreaction , but this means so much to me . &quot;
it just underlines how important this is to me , how hard i and helen , and robin , too , we have been working on .
worn out three years of helen &apos;s and robin have been awesome .
without him we would have no blue sky , so a big thank you to , he is the world &apos;s best coach .
i couldn &apos;t think of a better training partner or a better coach .
helen glover and heather stanning have not lost the competition for five years .
a couple of the set after a hard rhythm , which their competitors do not .
yet in the last 500 metrilläkin , when new zealand and denmark teams began to approach , stanningilla , and gloverilla was too much energy in stock .
we were very much caught up in the moment .
helen shouted , &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process &quot; .
it is really important to keep control .
we had a good start , and we are not at the same time tried to do anything special .
we &apos;ve been looking for today only we are good rowing and fireworks displays , the race to win , and so we did .
a couple of waiting a year before to decide on their future .
glover will attend next month &apos;s wedding , when she &apos;s going to marry the tv adventurer steve backshallin .
right now , he just wants to enjoy the moment .
&quot; i did not want to say that this would be the last competition .
it would have put too much pressure on .
after london , it took me about six months to realize that i was the olympic champion .
everything was so new , and i was so stressed out .
here it took me about four minutes .
this feels so much better , &quot; he said .

the tsunami of the past-in the news
sea myllertää on a huge scale , but the tidal wave of strikes in the middle of the bustle of the street-the madrid with the past can begin .
it summed up the essence of the story of pedro almodóvar novelty .
almodovarin previous foray into film direction matkarakastajat ( 2013 ) was a pikkuhauska and ronskinpuoleinen a satirical comedy , before the skin where i live ( 2011 ) espanjalaistaiturin career peaks .
tasollisesti julieta ( 2016 ) ranks somewhere between those two work .
it is thinking in human evolution a serene love , relationship and family drama , which focuses on the relationship between the mother and the daughter .
the story is simple and is seen very much as a long takaumana .
life seems to be the name of the person &apos;s proposal , a middle-schooler ( emma suarez ) , but then everything is threatening to fall apart .
in the aftermath of the new random encounters with a male friend ( dario grandinetti ) must not be bewildered by the end of the film , always stretch .

it is tasavahvasti näytelty , discreet , some good music , and a very sad movie , which , as such , is realizing that the material .

the movie people plagued by diseases , deaths , or sudden loss of only , but the size will remain the same for koreana hotel .
this is especially true in the case of the name of the person you live puvustukseen : change from one scene to the next , and the same is true for apparently identical korviksiin .
almodovar is accurate , but the main point of the current scene does not particularly substantial improvement in viritelmät .
mechanically , thus strengthening the impression at indignantly resented and a bit uninspired .
almodovar has made the script for the award-winning canadian literature nobelilla 2013 , on the basis of three short story by alice munron .
short stories have been published in runaway : stories .
almodovar has made the dialogue , the result is a bit of a tasapaksun a written literature in the remake .
the materials would have been emotionally by far the jykevämpäänkin drama , big issues , especially a nagging guilt-movie theme of the book is dealing with .

unemployment is 35 percent in this decade , the increased and prolonged on average 34 to 54 weeks .
unemployment now costs three billion a year more than in 2008 .
the general government debt , hetemaki esittelemillä graph that exceeded 60 % in 2014 , rising to 70 % in the middle of the next decade .
what is responsible ?
in the spring of 2015 debt recovery presented by the left-wing alliance was rejected because it was considered to be irresponsible .
the next year , unemployment is about eur 6 billion , which will be covered by virtually all new debt by taking .

snapchatin &quot; anime &quot; effect to a criticism of the aasialaiskarikatyyriksi
snapchatin , anime has been a source of inspiration for the filter , but according to some observers , it is racist .
lens tools with snapchat allows the user to edit about 150 million daily reality and identity used when playing in ways that are almost ridiculous .
you can change yourself ananakseksi , dog or character that would fit in the roy lichtenstein painting .
the lenses are simple facial features väänteleviä tools that produce more than 30 million revamped selfietä a day .
any missteps quickly end up in the public documents .
snapchatin lenses has in the past criticized accusations that the application to advertise the blackface-or &quot; mustanaama &quot; -the mask with white-washed skin the color of beauty as an ideal or favors .
so when snapchat advertised this week for some users of the lens , which gave them slanted eyes , slanted teeth and chubby cheeks , some critics called it a racist sex karikatyyriksi asian people- &quot; keltanaamaksi &quot; or yellowfaceksi .
and they are wondering whether these recurring polemiikit be a sign of the company &apos;s larger problem regarding diversity .
news and disapproval spread wide on wednesday the vergen and motherboardin data , days later , snapchat said lakkauttaneensa property .
the company offered an explanation : the lens was meant to be a tribute to karikatyyriksi and television and stage actor , not asian .
but the racism experienced observers , the lens was a reminder to any stereotypes .
others are vehemently denied by the animevertailun .
grace sparapani , a korean-american art student , which is widely twiittiä the photos were distributed , said the e-mail , that the lens was &quot; at the very least , offensive and uncomfortable &quot; .
he added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the side-by-side comparison , which are aggravated by aasialaiskarikatyyri and filter effects &quot; .
it indicates that the filter is not only keltanaama , but keltanaama , the extreme halventavuuteen .
snapchat is not the only company that exceeds these cultural trap wires .
american culture seems to be caught in an endless struggle with diversity and inclusion , the portraits of these meeting rooms to hollywood and devices , which all carry in our hands .
and snapchatin a huge , racially diverse audience of young people from their parents may refer that they even are more likely to expect a sensitive attitude .
the 25-year-old katie , zhu said in an interview on thursday , that when one of the snapchatin of the lenses to create a user infringing image , &quot; these types is much more difficult to be inconspicuous &quot; .
on thursday , zhu , a product manager for mediumille and engineer , decided to delete the snapchat account and urged others to do the same .
kirjoitelmassaan mediumille and in a telephone interview , he said that he believed that the remuneration practices of racial disputes reflect the lack of diversity in the snapchatin .
zhu reviewed the company &apos;s predominantly white male leadership and decided to kirjoitelmansa hashtagilla # deletesnapchat ( # poistasnapchat )
&quot; either they don &apos;t have a person in his diverse representation of the colors of the skin , which is why they are able to make these kinds of decisions , &quot; the chinese-american , zhu said , &quot; or they have a different skin color representatives at work , but they are not in positions where the feel or be able to talk directly . &quot;
others observers share his opinion , complaint , where snapchat has left largely unanswered .
the company does not publish figures on staff diversity , drawing attention to the status as a private company .
on thursday , snapchat refused to discuss the staff , according to a company representative of the racial backgrounds , but hired some time ago to the recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and to take forward the internal integration efforts .
for his part , zhu said that it is snapchat-account closed , adding : &quot; i wonder if the so that they , in fact , need more just like users to be able to say that this is not ok . &quot;

&quot; the whole of the first half of the year 2015 , the time many headquarters press releases , statements and certificates to congress were significantly more positive than the actual events , &quot; the report said .
centcomin authority , for example , said in public , that the suurhyökkäys of the back to retake the could start as early as april or may 2015 .
mosul , iraq &apos;s second largest city , is still in the possession of the isisin .

&quot; the years between 2014 and 2015 , the centcom intelligence assessment of iraq &apos;s security forces was created by isisin and too isolated from the process , &quot; representative adam b . schiff , a leading democrat of the committee , said in a statement .
schiff &apos;s , according to this process , &quot; it has just kept delaying the release of &quot; the intelligence of outputs , the mood among analysts , and not &quot; given enough space in the eriäville view of the woods &quot; .
schiff , and democrats said that they could not find evidence that the white house had tried to put pressure on the centcomin analysts to reconcile its conclusions on a &quot; pre-defined political narrative &quot; .
the daily beast reported on tuesday the preliminary findings of the investigation of congress .
last august , the new york times reported that the pentagon &apos;s inspector general has opened an investigation into complaints of centcomin analysts .
lieutenant commander patrick evans , the pentagon &apos;s representative , said in a statement that the ministry of defence does not comment on the report of the congress as long as the inspector general of the investigation is in progress .
but he said that &quot; between the experts disagree on the interpretation of complex data , and the intelligence community and the ministry of defence will keep a healthy dialogue on these essential national security topics welcome . &quot;
in the second study , there are other sanctions , as only with regard to the question of whether the u.s.-led bombing operations in iraq and syria a success ( such as the growing number of defense authorities now claim ) .
last year &apos;s allegations , questioned how much president obama can count on the headquarters to provide honest assessments of the iraq crisis , afghanistan , libya and other items to military action .
islamic state intelligence review reflects more than a decade ago , when the centcomin intelligence analyst , gregory hooker , wrote in a research article , which said that , despite the objections of several analysts , president george w . bush &apos;s administration was in favour of a small army in iraq and spent very little time in deciding what penalties to the 2003 attack .
hooker had a key role in the revolt on islamic state intelligence .
according to the authorities , the group came to the conclusion that in the last year despite hooker &apos;s public statements , the air strikes against the islamic state-controlled factories were not significantly weakened the economy of the terrorist group , because it was built by the tilapäisjalostamoita in order to sell oil on the black market .
the times reported in september that this discovery does not , however , been told outside of headquarters .
centcomin bridges the commander , gen. lloyd j . austin iii , was criticised last year when many lawmakers saw as his witness to the senate ylipositiivisena estimate of the war .
general austin retired in april , and he was replaced by general joseph l . votel became the headquarters .

the day after , when it was made three goals in the team &apos;s triumph at the japanese 6-1 , katie bam did on thursday , the united states women &apos;s field hockey team &apos;s first two goals in the americans &apos; triumph at the indian 3-0 .
five goals in two playing sounds for saavutukselta , but the 27-year-old bam said , that it was not sure whether he was previously done the same thing .
&quot; i have no idea , &quot; he said .
&quot; i &apos;m not really the kind of person that keeps a record of maaleistaan . &quot;
but this he knows : the americans are 4-0-olympialaisturnauksessa and they share the group &apos;s first place in the uk , which was still unbeaten after winning on thursday , the japanese 2-0 .
britain and the united states face off on saturday in the final game of the first round .
both teams have to survive the quarterfinals , and this game will determine who finishes in the first and second of their six-team group who .
the first place to avoid the strong dutch , another team leader , a little longer at the start of the quarter finals .
how any of saturday &apos;s game is over , the americans have raised a stir that displays a success here , four years after that , when they stayed at the london olympics the last 12 teams .
bam was the team .
he grew up in pennsylvania , the blue bell offers and pick up the hockey stick their hands for the first time at age 3 ( he &apos;s older twin sister played the type of drexelissä ) on the national team at the age of 16 , when he became the youngest ever player .
he was not involved in the 2008 olympic games , because , according to the final had been unable to players list » .
in 2012 there is nothing worked for him and his teammates .
the following year an english craig parnham was appointed as the new head coach , and things began to change .
&quot; culture change &quot; , a mental change , a physical change , &quot; bam said .
we have not had the same work rate in london than we have now .
we have done an about-turn .
on thursday evening , bam began his first-half goal in the act of rystylyönnillä near goals .
india had entered the game in the air a single victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly hard and held the situation to be found near the end of the third installment of the 1-0-until now , when bam , took over the situation .
he carried the ball to the left of the field for a long time , then toured the center and wrenched the ball to the finish line , taking the americans 2-0-lead .
melissa gonzalez added the last goal in the middle of the fourth .
this game was the first united states zero goalkeeper jackie briggsille , who had allowed one goal in each of the first three for the win .
he is in good tune .
so too is the bam .
&quot; we now have a good situation , &quot; parnham said , but it will depend on the outcome of saturday &apos;s game , goodness .
peace of olympialaisvimman in the middle of the trampoline
wherever you are , whatever time it is , the olympics are under way .
rio de janeiro &apos;s events seem to say &apos; yes &apos; and the inevitable , a raging competition and achievement , message .
just as the olympic torch relay would be a flaming baton , which is passed to the jousiampujalta uimarille and voimistelijalta triathlonistille .
it is impossible to put on top of the television , read the newspaper or listen to the vierustoverin debate about the café in the queue without having to consult with simone bilesista , katie ledeckysta or michael phelps and chad and between le clos &apos;n .
and then there is a logan dooley .
dooley , the olympic first-timer , and the charmer &apos;s smile with potholes , could very well be one of the names of all the knowledge , which will be presented to them in prime time , and that the shoulders of sponsorships , as well as feel-good tv ads-if she had a swimmer , gymnast or even olympic fencer .
but the california lake forest , dooley , 28 , is competing in the olympic trampoline gold .
the olympic flame will not illuminate all species as much .
further from the centre , in partial shade , are the species which are subject to all in general do not accept : the air pistol shooting , archery , badminton , taekwondo .
we will always have the breaststroke , long it live .
but if i may make a moderate number erityissuosikistani , i would like to draw your attention to the entry into force of the understated charm of the trampoline .
although trampoline has been an olympic sport since 2000 , when it made its debut at the world cup in sydney , its presence is in the last 16 years , between the comments so little that many that i interviewed , did not perceive at all for it to be olympialaislajin .
this can be a regional ignorance .
although the united states has sent athletes to compete in the sport , it has never won the medals and athlete advanced to the finals until the year 2012 .
the chinese and the russians , the chinese , and canadians in general , men share the women &apos;s medals .
this year , china &apos;s dong dong and defended london &apos;s gold mitaleitaan canadian rosie mclennan .
however , there is a certain new york yankees from the charm of the trampoline , in part because of an uneducated ear it sounds to fit better in clown school as in the olympic games .
here i have to confess that i am not an expert , i &apos;m just a flightless fan .
discipline is the chance huvittavuuteen , such as seeing as the ratio of a drawing to purchase film connection : keep-alive , but it is also a gymnastics and uimahypyn sulokkuutta , two species that it in principle .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the spanish word for el trampolín , which means a pop-up .
the championship chasers were jumping with giant trampoline up to a height of nearly 30 feet , and they must be carried out kieppuvia series ( translations , page layouts and flips ) and eventually land on their feet .
according to the official programme of the olympic games , they will be assessed , on the basis of the difficulty , and the &quot; air time &quot; .
rio is competing with 32 athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women .
the most common form of the olympic games , the direction is straight forward .
women who want to go for the gold medals in the quest for further , faster , up and over-sometimes for the finish line , sometimes back and forth around the field .
they are just the start to the finish line or down the side of the forest , but also , in a televised media reporting , the second irvailevaa of the border : the world or olympic records .
this determined pursuit of a noble , admirable and even fanatical-and it can get up to the viewer to tears .
but it is also the reason why the world cup can be a frightening prospect can be a little exhausting .
the trampoline features a rest for a moment here .
trampoline &apos;s direction is up .
the goal is not to move forward .
rival rises to a new surge in affecting painottomalta as an astronaut , will go up , then down , then up again easily .
this does not , of course , will not go into the competition and difficulty , but the programme is not a fierce rush towards the end of the period , not only in the distance , weight and jumps in the power of the dream-like , smooth .
it is as close to a zen space , than what the olympics can be achieved .
women &apos;s qualifying competitions and then the final will take place on friday afternoon at the start of the broadcast at 10 ( et ) , the men &apos;s games will come on saturday , also at 13 .
nbc broadcast the finals as part of the afternoon on the day of starting at 14 has provided both .
olympic buzz in the middle of a quiet , charming , they provide for a moment , that you will probably not notice the general chaos .
and if awareness is reached only by offering the miesurheilijoita tuijotettavaksi and esineellistettäväksi ( such as the united states miesvoimistelijat some time ago , as suggested by the wall street journal ) , dooley just waiting for huokailevaa a new fan base .
&quot; generation to demonstrate &quot; in ethiopia , which is an ally of the united states long-term
violent protests in ethiopia
the demonstrators , calling for political change in ethiopia have encountered violent opposition to the government .
eyewitnesses say that dozens of the protesters have been shot dead in the clashes with the police .
whether ethiopia crumbling ?
in the past decade , it has been one of the most stable countries in africa , the west , a strong ally , whose economy is growing rapidly .
over the last few months the government are opposed to the protests , however , have shaken the country spreading to more areas .
last week , thousands of people rushed to the streets alone , calling for fundamental political change .
according to the government &apos;s response to the human rights groups was relentless .
witnesses said that police officers shot and killed dozens of unarmed protesters .
the demonstrations spread , recorded videos , which is believed to be the end of last year or the beginning of this year , show how security officers hitting with sticks , young people at the same time , when they were forced to stand with his hands against the wall .
pääihmisoikeusviranomainen of the united nations is now asking for a thorough investigation .
&quot; keeping this country together was always difficult , and in the future , it is going to be even more difficult , &quot; said rashid abdi , who is the project manager for the horn of africa , the international crisis group , a research group .
ethiopia is africa &apos;s second most populous country after nigeria , and the west will appreciate the stability of the system .
american military and intelligence agencies to work in close cooperation in the fight against terrorist threats in the region with the ethiopians in particular in somalia , and there is hardly any african country will get as much help from the west .
ethiopia &apos;s economy has grown at an impressive rate .
the infrastructure has improved tremendously a lot , and the capital city of addis ababa , is up to the new commuter train .
the city streets are typically quiet , safe and clean .
although there is not , however , been a model of democracy in ethiopia in the picture . human rights groups have consistently talked about government repression , the opposition has been limited , and dissenters are silenced .
many have been driven out of the country , jailed , killed or driven to the far desert .
but this may be changing .
&quot; if you suppress the people , and they have no other options than to demonstrate , this will be the case , &quot; seyoum teshome , a university teacher in central ethiopia , said .
the entire youth to demonstrate .
one generation to demonstrate .
the complaints are varied and cover all of the land-use ruling coalition stranglehold .
in recent years much of the ruling party and its allies as well as further after the elections was the last opposition held on , and now it holds all the seats .
at the same time , tensions on the border with eritrea . this tense and disputed border along the way been the battle claimed hundreds of lives in june .
analysts fear that the separatist groups like the oromo liberation front of ethiopia meles zenawi or the national liberation front , which has over the past few years , more or less defeated , may try to use a pumice stone , and arm ourselves again .
several factors explain why over the years under the surface of the bitter feelings are now blowing up after loading .
the first affects the seemingly harmless-looking : smartphones .
only in the last few years a large number of ethiopians has been able to communicate through social media , when cheaper smartphones have become more common , and internet service .
even if the government would close access to facebook and twitter , as it often does , especially during the demonstrations , many people will still be able to communicate the location of servers on the network piilottavien .
many of the young ethiopians , said that in this way , they gathered at the demonstrations .
secondly , the two largest ethnic groups of ethiopia , oromo people , and amharat , will better work with each other .
oromo people , and amharat are not natural allies .
for a very long time amharat , that come from the ethiopian highlands , were mainly christians in politics and business , taking advantage of the oromoita , many of which are muslims and who live in the alangoilla .
but this , too , is changing .
&quot; we are on our way towards the organisation under the one umbrella of &quot; gemechu oromojohtaja , mulatu said .
the biggest protests have been in amharic and oromoalueilla .
many of the amharat and the oromo people , who think , that ethiopia is dominated by unfairly tigre people . the nation covers approximately six per cent of the population and dominated the armed forces , intelligence services , trade and policy .
the third reason for the unrest is the loss of meles zenawi .
meles , a former rebel leader , was prime minister of ethiopia for 17 years until he died in a secret illness in 2012 .
he was considered as a kind of prodigy , which saw around corners .
analysts say that he was especially qualified to observe early signs of discontent and to use secret messengers of the opponents is harmless .
&quot; the present government is not the likeness of perusvaistoa &quot; , a conflict analyst abdi said .
hailemariam desalegn in ethiopia , the new prime minister , was picked by a relatively unknown to meet meles &apos;n boots .
as opposed to meles , who was from the northern ethiopian tigre , hailemariam is from the south .
analysts say that the tigrejen-controlled security services do not trust him .
many fear that this may lead to increased bloodshed .
the last time was in such turmoil in ethiopia in 2005 , when thousands of people demonstrated in the elections , which according to analysts , the government seemed to like the first hutiloi and then robbed them .
in the ensuing power attack many of the protesters were killed , although less than in the last few months , and that the period of anxiety went over relatively quickly .
development experts have praised the leaders of ethiopia , näkemyksellisestä infrastruktuurisuunnittelusta , such as a new mission from the train , and the considerable advancements in the battle of köyhyydenvastaisessa .
but clearly this is not stopped within the country , the ethiopian government &apos;s contempt .
and now it starts to get dangerous , an ethnic format .
last month , the city of gondarissa was attacked by the protesters from the cross tigrejen-owned businesses , and tigre-the fight against hatred becomes more and more common in social media .
analysts say that the demonstrations will put united states and other länsiliittolaiset some awkward position .
the american government has used as a base for model airplane flights to neighbouring ethiopia into somalia , although it some time ago , said sulkeneensa this .
although the western countries clearly want to support democracy , they do not want the collapse of the already unstable ally .
&quot; this , &quot; abdi said , &quot; it is a real balancing act . &quot;
donald trump to explain to obama-set up-isisin-argument &quot; sarkasmiksi &quot;
donald j . trump tried to quell the controversy on friday by claiming to be sweeping the last campaign that he was not serious about , when he persisted , many times this week , that president obama and hillary clinton were &quot; the founders &quot; of the terrorist group , the islamic state .
the statement raised new questions about the republican presidential candidate &apos;s ability to communicate clearly amerikkalaisyleisölle .
it also gave her its advocates , who have strained to defend him during a turbulent period , in a difficult position , with their need to explain remarks that he does not necessarily mean .
on wednesday evening , after a campaign meeting , the hint of thursday &apos;s interviews with the same enthusiasm , trump still claimed that he persisted that he indeed had this to say , that the president and clinton was created by isisin .
early friday morning , twitter-publication of the trump , however , said that he was just being sarcastic .
the release was an about-face from the previous day , when trump said in various interviews that she had been really serious accusation .
when the konservatiiviradiojuontaja hugh hewitt tried to help by reminding him that giving you a point about trumpia obama wants to destroy isisin , the republican presidential candidate by this point of ignoring ears .
the most recent review of the storm will be in a situation in which trump has tried again to focus his campaign on the economy falling in the middle of the results of the survey .
trump and clinton fought for speaking about the economy this week , in michigan .
on friday , trump tried to once again return to the topic .
and , once again , twitter , he warned that clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes , and that he was giving a speech in tylsistyttävänä .
trump has in the past used sarcasm .
late in july , after he faced widespread criticism for apparently suggesting that the russians should hack clinton &apos;s emails , he later explained to the comment by saying , &quot; of course , i &apos;m being sarcastic &quot; .
the approach allows it , that trump may visit the political speech on the borders and then come back again .
&quot; i think that it is a template , where he tests the specific messages that are important to his fans . he believes , how they work and then &apos; clarify &apos; one way or the other , depending on the reaction , &quot; said ruth sherman , a communications expert who has followed both the candidates &apos; use of language .
but i also believe that he is a knowing of its opinions , and know that they are sufficiently vague so that they can be filtered through a variety of lenses .
instead , that would be great for the public , calling for a vote , in the last few days have been more sapekkaampi trump is , when his popularity has continued to slide .
new , on friday published in the nbc / wall street journal / marist poll survey showed that trump lags far behind president clinton in north carolina , virginia , and colorado , and that the race is tight in florida .
although trump , as a rule , will endeavour to avoid any apology statement to the provocative things , he often blames the abuse arises from the arvostelijoitaan words or sense of humour misunderstood .
his face still closer examination of the presidential campaign for the past few months , trump &apos;s jokes are forced with his faithful allies in an uncomfortable position where they have to publicly support him , no matter how provocative in his comments are .
new york &apos;s former mayor rudolph w . giuliani , who is one of the most important supporters of trump &apos;s , saw a lot of effort in defending the candidate , in an interview with cnn on thursday .
&quot; i believe he is real , political comments , &quot; giuliani said , when he was asked about the veracity of the accounts submitted in connection with my father &apos;s argument that as obama and clinton set up an islamic state .
it is true in the sense that it was more or less unknown , before obama isis small organization , which he called reinstated as an amateur , totally wrong , and that &apos;s why it happened , as he pulled the troops out of iraq .
most of the mainstream republicans are trying to argue that the obama government , which clinton worked as foreign minister , let isisin get worse , because it is not managed effectively to deal with the situation in the middle east .
before the pennsylvania friday &apos;s meetings with trump went on to attack towards the news media on twitter , who in his every word and are biased against him .
he mocked the &quot; poor , pathetic &quot; television experts , who are trying to get him a clear , saying &quot; they do not fail ! &quot;
some democrats scoffed at trump &apos;s excuse for the new evidence to the fact that he is unfit to be president .

a square meal : depression a crippling food
in march , 1933 , soon after becoming president , franklin delano roosevelt sat down to eat lunch in the post room .
treat suuna president roosevelt had to sophisticated dishes , fifth avenue , such as the hanhenmaksapasteijasta , and the maryland terrapin soup .
on the day of her diet was more modest : stuffed eggs in tomato sauce , mashed potatoes , and a dessert of plum pudding .
&quot; it was a culinary solidarity for people who are suffering from , &quot; jane ziegelman said .
her husband , andrew coe , added : &quot; it was also a message to americans about how you should eat . &quot;
brooklyn heightsissä couple is living food historians .
coen &apos;s latest book , chop suey , told the chinese food in america , and ziegelman said the life of the lower east side blocks in its food through 97 orchard .
their latest collaboration , a square meal , that harper will publish on tuesday , is the history of american food during the great depression of the 1930s .
click some sort of its own culinary solidarity they meet the vendor &apos;s dinner eisenberg &apos;s sandwich shop , teeny-tiny , hienostelemattomassa packed the bar in the flatiron district and which has been in operation since the 1929 stock market crash .
ziegelman , 54 , ordered the cream cheese-bread , oliivivoi and coe , 57 , took a dose of kalkkunalla , perunasoseella and vegetables .
when a reporter ordered the meatloaf , the couple saw fit to discuss depression eating .
&quot; the murekkeet were very popular , &quot; ziegelman said .
it was peanut butter , liver , bean loaf .
they were made in the manufacturing of the substance and for some cheap ingredients , which extended to the actual manufacturing of the substance .
imagine a syöväsi so much for peanuts , that they were for dinner .
coe sneered .
&quot; it is certainly felt in the stomach lyijynraskaalta , &quot; he said .
in the years before the recession hit , through the americans &apos; tables , in particular in rural areas , it was like eating-as-much-as-all-buffet .
women &apos;s groups were making food for the male farm workers , and fresh pie to serve breakfast , lunch and dinner .
the americans sent food to the starving europeans during the first world war . a square meal-book kronikoi the ways in which the nation survived that it suddenly was the abundance of the land .
&quot; at that time , food became a central subject of the americans , oppressive , &quot; coe said , explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it .
equally distressing was the new , low-cost diet : the mystery of the dishes , such as murekkeista and boxes , main dishes , and came to the box was &quot; a great way to use leftovers of food , &quot; said ziegelman , because chefs were able to hide the less attractive ingredients with a creamy sauce to layer under it .
the fresh fruit was replaced by a less expensive kuivatuilla with fruit .
the meat , which had for years been at the heart of the amerikkalaisaterioiden , became a luxury product dispensed sparingly .
special aggregates and nutrient content of calories tested more important than taste or even common sense in the kitchen .
in doing research for the record that contains the recipes for ziegelman produced the era of course , with fried onions were filled with peanut butter .
&quot; it &apos;s been popular for dinner on the table , &quot; coe said .
ziegelman stated : &quot; it was unreal . &quot;
peanut butter does not in any way to fit into the paistettuihin sipuleihin .
this was characterised by many household resepteille .
home economists , such as louise stanley , director of the federal government in the years 1923-1943 , the household was guided by the country &apos;s eating habits more than ever before or after .
publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines they encouraged women to start on the &quot; budjetoijiksi &quot; and to meet the challenge to convert soseutetun möykyt maistuviksi such as spaghetti and carrots .
a square meal is a feast of historic taste of the fire .
particularly tasty are the reports of the government &apos;s reaction to hunger as to president herbert hoover let me eat cake attitude .
at the same time , when he publicly praised her childhood in simple , iowalaista food , he refined and refreshments , such as a millionaire , that he had become .
&quot; he was going to continental food , such as fish with cucumber sauce , &quot; coe said .
he ate almost kullatussa in the dining room wearing a tuxedo .
he was the great outdoors .
president roosevelt could have made the same mistake , unless his wife , eleanor , had encouraged him to set an example on your own on your stomach .
as the book explains , when mrs. roosevelt hired housekeepers , who had no interest in taste , from the white house came to the place , which &quot; did not offer only ankeimpiin , but also surkeimmin of washington food . &quot;
many of the lamanaikaisista dining habits was rejected as soon as the country got back on its feet .
inheritance is a continuing our focus on kaloreihin and nutrition , ziegelman said , and the way how science applies to cooking .
the couple said that when he wrote the book , they gained a better understanding of the ziegelmanin mother &apos;s dining habits , for example , about how he was unable to throw food away .
&quot; she really was afraid of wasting food , &quot; coe said .
ziegelman , recalled : &quot; he even sickened people . &quot;
it came wind hat incident .
after the plates were empty , eisenbergissä , he and coe pulled out the dessert , which they had prepared at home : plum dessert , which president roosevelt ate for lunch .
&quot; it &apos;s called plum foam , &quot; ziegelman said , adding that a common trick was to give the name of the vaatimattomille resepteille the exterior .
ex-food was not whipped , only plums , a bit of flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .

scot callum skinner crashed on to the finish line of the british napatessa cycling gold
scotland &apos;s callum skinner kiisi honor men &apos;s rio joukkuesprintissä cycling in the stadium last night , when the british team at the 2012 london trio defended his title for the year .
the 23-year-old from glasgow was the anchor role , where his scottish colleagues sir chris roy distinguished himself as a youth , legend was proud when this kiisi finish napaten victory over the favourite new zealand team .
britain took a shock victory four years ago , at the same time , as part of their gold for the fifth of the six olympic hoy won .
and they repeated the trick coming off the modestly kuudensiksi march-run in the world cup in london , although hoy has since decided to race in his career .
beijing and london olympic games between the problem was the replacement of the erikoislähettäjä jamie staff .
this was achieved just in time , when hindes appeared .
hoy &apos;s compresion ending also created a vacuum , which kian emadi and matt crampton were trying to fill .
skinner was a man , which in relation to the skotissa potential of the british coaches insisted that now is understood .
hindes , kenny-who won the championship four years ago , with hoy &apos;s compresion and skinner made the olympic record in the time trials , but new zealand took the leadership in the first round .
and the british trio won the duel of gold .
hindes was your round after narrowly behind , but kenny shoved the team &apos;s leadership , and skinner had to stick to it .
the strategy change was a big part of the transformation , and it belonged to the hindesin driving a bigger gear , so that he would slow down and allow the kennyn and , in particular , skinner &apos;s hold on the pace .
hoy was followed by the role of the bbc as an expert , and drew the attention of the skinner , kennyn and hindesin their when he took the podium .
the 23-year-old i am told by mr skinner said : &quot; the comparison is flattering . &quot;
i &apos;m just here to do my best and hankkiakseni fame .
we made the final with an olympic record and we beat the world champions .
it was absolutely incredible .
there may be better ways to win .
after winning the london 2012 kennyn and hoy &apos;s compresion alongside hindes admitted that it was intentionally crashed on the track after a bad start .
he later pulled the comments back , and not the uk &apos;s competitors have complained .
this time , in the case of force majeure , the victory was not a similar problem .
hindes said : &quot; it felt like when it would have been in london , when the pedestal was so much british tickets . &quot;
as a team we found a connection in the last three months of the year .
we have lost so many world championships , so the olympic games winning again is simply stunning .
one of the gold medal of the event , one of the people , who won seven of the species , as well as a total of ten cycling in beijing that in london .
if this is the last of five months of development , we expect a successful five-day cycling stadium .
on the basis of the kennyn by the condition , it is not at all impossible to imagine him playing three olympic gold medal won by hoy &apos;s compresion urotekoa , one at the olympics .
it would mean that the kennyn-which is exactly 12 years younger than hoy , who is also born with 23 . march ( during that time , apparently as a sacred day for british sport , which is also a steve redgraven , mo farah and roger bannisterin birthday ) -the total amount of the increase to six gold medals and one silver .
it would be the same as the hoylla .
kenny competes in the next sprint , which starts today and will last for three days .
holidaymakers driving from bolton , the 28-year-old said : &quot; i enjoy now , just this one .
the team competition is always the best .
it will be overcome with your friends .
to be honest , to win alone , lonely . &quot;
hindes said : &quot; if he wins the other two gold medals , he should be given a knighthood . &quot;
this was a day for the only medal of the competition , but the kingdom received more good news .
sir bradley wiggins , ed clancy , steven burke and owain doull had the fastest time in time to double , 4 km team pursuit qualifying .
their time was 3 : 51 : 943 .
london 2012 gold won a world record is 3 : 51 : 659 .
in the first round and the final ( 22.42 ) will be held today , the second day of the competition , in which case wiggins is certainly the centre of attention .
he had a dispute with the judges yesterday before the time trials , when officers called him the length of the measurement .
the equivalent women &apos;s competition continues and ends tomorrow , laura trott , joanna rowsell shand , elinor barker and milngavien katie archibald progressed to the world in record time , the clock stops at the time of 4 : 13 : 260 .
the british team has learned to trust that its an awesome track cycling team to take over the central part of the olympic games , and to achieve the full set of medals .
after beijing and london really exceptional and perfect management , expectations have downplayed before the rio games .
in the background there has been drama , the technical director of the notable successes of which have not been , shane sutton , the difference in april because of accusations of sexism and temptation , as well as suurhenkilöiden , such as hoy &apos;s compresion and victoria pendleton civil service reform , the racing career .
based on the first night races in the cycling stadium , however , it seems that the reputation of the british the now legendary rise to the pinnacle of a perfect moment to once again be the case .
the portland smelter because of an agreement to cut the future questionable
portland victoria aluminum smelter , as well as hundreds of workers &apos; jobs , the future is uncertain , when the factory electricity company recorded net sales of electric company revealed that one of the factory owners are coming to the distribution agreement , so it is expected of all distribution contracts .
the action follows a decision by the victorian government earlier this year that the plant in operation for keeping the required payments will not be extended .
a 20-year period provided for in the t runs out in november .
up to 2,000 jobs could be at risk of alcoa &apos;s portland plant .
up to 2,000 jobs could be at risk , either directly or indirectly , with the closure of the factory .
in addition to the snowball effect can be possible , since the smelter uses about 10 % of victoria &apos;s total electricity production .
in 2014 , the alcoa closed the point henry smelter , which led to the closure of the plant in the last year , anglesean .
alcoa &apos;s portland smelter will lose money and is under threat of closure .
the measure follows now for a number of years of speculation about the future of the plant , which began as a result of the strong australian dollar and the price of production in recent times due to the factory .
agl , which distributes electricity to the general alumiinisulatolle latrobe valley , loy yang an the power of children , said that it expects the closing of the owner of the three the rest of the contract .
most of the factory owned by alcoa and aluminan syndrome , and the chinese citic , as well as the japanese marubeni corp. own smaller shares .
&quot; the continuation of the activities of the portland plant , agl expects the smelter physical electricity demand will continue , &quot; it said .
agl : n according to the agreements , are the so-called &quot; protection contracts &quot; , which was supposed to come into force in november 2016 .
agreements have a 12-month notice period , so they run out in 2017 .
&quot; that is why agl expects the contracts to produce results for the fiscal year 2017 , &quot; the power company said .
the result of the effects of all possible agl : lle from the financial year 2018 forward limit at the moment , the wholesale electricity prices in the futures market , with strong views .
agl said it has already &quot; in anticipation of the end of the &quot; reduced the value of the contracts on its books for $ 187 million .
alcoa said that the decision to terminate the contracts does not affect alcoa &apos;s ... ability to keep the supply of electricity to melt or to safeguard the smelter &quot; .
the us company said it signed a 20-year contract with loy yang in 2010 , and the entry into force of the agreement was to come in november of this year , but it has not yet explained why it withdrew from the treaty .
analysts have been on the alert , as well as in victoria , the portland smelter that also the possible closure of the newcastle , located near the tomagon factory , because of the economic situation in the sector is poor .
in the past week on the agl : n the executive director stephen mikkelsen told analysts that the portland spends about 600 megawatts of electricity and tomago about 900 megawatts .
&quot; if the two plants will be removed from the market , this is a significant reduction in the demand for &#91; electricity &#93; markets .

kendall , is not just a kardashianien reality tv star , is on the cover of vogue &apos;s september
kendall jenner , 20 , a model and mother-manager kris kardashian jenner clan-the fourth daughter , the number on the cover of the september vogue the united states desired .
kendall , who is estee lauderin brändilähettiläs and been a model in milan , paris and new york fashion week , announced the news on thursday , instagram account .
&quot; to see this room , which is filled with loved ones , made me cry , &quot; kendall wrote .
the cover of the publication was followed by the eccentric ( or perhaps just kardashianien in the style appropriate ? ) , scripted reality-video , where the whole of the kardashian-jenner clan ( not including problem cases and with rob and caitlyn , all of your favorite entertainment uncle , keeping up producer ryan seacrest ) forgot about her sister &apos;s cover , but that ended in the classical turning point : they suunnittelivatkin a surprise party .
it has almost every children &apos;s television series &quot; birthday section &quot; clichéd plot pattern ( seacrest recites the words &quot; you are not suppose to have thought , that we will forget you &quot; aamupiirretyn pupujussin the credibility ) , but kris had to get other tyttönsä somehow take advantage of this .
this is because we have certainly moved on to a new kardashianien era in the september vogue on .
kendall &apos;s older sister kim might recognize in the action first ( he shared it with her husband , kanye west in april 2014 ) , but the magazine in the september number is absolutely in a class of its own .
the september vogue number is the size of the year &apos;s most selling edition .
its thickness is more like a coffee table book than a fashion magazine , and the number will attract a huge number of advertisers ( fashionista went down , that last year &apos;s 832-page opuksesta 615 was advertising content ) .
the unveiling of the cover star is expected to so vehemently , that in the last two years , the pictures in the newspaper were leaked before the official release .
previous women on the cover have been , among other things , naomi campbell , linda evangelista and kate moss .
in the last few years there have indeed been on the cover of the more &quot; celebrities who act as models for the &quot; as of &quot; templates that are celebrities &quot; .
oscar-winner and dior &apos;s ambassador , jennifer lawrence was on the cover of in 2013 , the year of lady gaga &apos;s pride of place .
but if that happened , jenner , which the magazine describes his generation &quot; success model &quot; , to hit the first , he is a pretty good company .
these celebrities are not famous people &apos;s relatives , or realitytähtiä , or in today &apos;s young people , who know how to make a good snapchat-the video ( though jenner has all of this ) .
they are reasonably talented women who become successful in the entertainment industry .
last year &apos;s cover model beyoncella has been lemonaden with the release of one of the strongest in the years of his career .
all , of course , are not pleased with the successes of the jenner .
her reality tv-old jenner status in the fashion world will always be uncomfortable .
in june , the original victoria &apos;s secret model stephanie seymour has reviewed the jenneriä and colleague gigi hadidia , calling them &quot; the ämmiksi of the moment &quot; .
this feeling once again rose to the surface with the cover of vogue-jenner .
but discontent rotation is quite improper .
kendall jenner is the number on the cover of the september vogue .
in the purest sense of the word , she is a supermodel .
he is a model for marc jacobs .
he will sell you the estee lauderin makeup moisturizer .
he and all of his sister are selling you the pictures of themselves , pay for their own wall at home .
he sells pictures of cindy crawford &apos;s daughter , that he took the love magazine .
and in his spare time , possibly just to see her sister kourtneyta and the children , he is a reality tv star .

the community already limits venytetyt legal services are gearing up for more cuts .
in june of next year the number of these legal centres is to lose 30 % of federal funding .
the queensland community legal centres director james farrell said that the most recent national association of community legal centres-calculation according to the report , thousands of people turned away at the already out of each year .
farrell said that if the federal government &apos;s decision is not reversed , the situation is only going to get worse .
&quot; the queensland community legal centres are chronically under-funded , which means that each year , thousands of people turned out for the essential services , &quot; he said .
people who leave violent relationships , which is uncontrollable and responsible creditor , separated families , unfairly separated employees-all of these people have legal problems , and this report shows that they do not get the help they need .
the federal government cut funding by 30 % in june 2017 , which means that thousands of residents of the vulnerable queensland is forced to navigate the complex legal problems without help .
we call on the minister of justice , as well as the queensland senator george brandisiin , that they immediately withdraw these funding cuts , so that people can get the help they need help with legal problems .
last year , the provincial government implemented its promise to raise the level of legal aid funding for the national average .

the spirit of the olympic games , the british will have to channel and to expand heathrow
heathrow will bring recovery and the blossoming of the size of the stomach , not only in local communities and across london .
for myself , this was heathrow great charm , just as it was also in the london 2012 olympic games charm , when we saw a huge amount of effort to ensure that all of our people and our region would benefit from the world cup .
the olympic games were given the enormous benefits of stratfordille and east endille .
and we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses to heathrow .
only the local communities will be created 10 000 40 000 new jobs in the new training places and , as well as removing unemployment around the airport .
as well as before the london 2012 games , some will come from ajattelemana , and a challenge to the expansion of heathrow is too large .
i was told that the kingdom will never be ready for the world cup , and that would put us to shame in front of the world .
the skeptics were wrong in 2012 , and they are going to be in the wrong to heathrow .
there are always there , but heathrow is responsible for each question , which it is presented .
like the olympic games , including the heathrow is infrastruktuuriprojekti for many , not just a select few .
the extension is the ability to create up to 180 000 new jobs and 211 billion the pound sterling economic growth , as well as leave a legacy , as well as the recruitment and skills around the airport and around the uk .
we have a flat-screen tv , awesome team , which has taken 11 billion £ infrastruktuurisijoitusohjelman on time and on budget while still remaining : t5 : stä , who has been voted the world &apos;s best airport terminaaliksi , five days in a row , two of the busiest in the world , which was built in the t2 from a runway .
now , the team is ready to take the third runway , which supports 16 bn pounds private money .
the london olympic games in 2012 , were a great success , and i am convinced that the heathrow extension is it .
it is time for us to channel the spirit of the olympic games and to expand heathrow , to ensure the future of the trade , and to create a legacy of skills and employment , from which britain can be proud of .

on tuesday , facebook said that it change the ads around the web page code , so that it would be more difficult to detect , and ads inhibitors which parts of the page are advertisements .
but now , adblock says that it is bypassed with the new code .
in the blog post adblockin representative ben williams wrote that &quot; this kind of return the battle to open-source the ads block between the community and its kiertäjien has been running ever since , when the ad blocking was invented &quot; , and that it is possible that facebook comes up with its own solution soon .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has taken part in the fight , there is a strong indication of how great the sorrow of the ad estäjistä has become an industry .
worldwide , about 200 million use to serve ads on inhibitors , describes last year &apos;s pagefairin and adobe &apos;s study . this is nearly four times more than that which was used by these programs in 2013 .
1.03 million active daily users use facebook on mobile devices , and 84 % of the mobiilimainostus are now facebook &apos;s advertising revenue .
the company , however , is the computer used for the pages of ads for mobile ads , the inhibitors of the enzyme inhibitors do not work on the social network facebook &apos;s mobile applications , or instagramille , a representative said .
computer ads bring more and enough income , so that this kind of action considered worthy of investment in facebook .
also on tuesday , facebook said that it would up-date &quot; ad fancy &quot; -tool with a view to giving people more power in terms of how ads are targeted to them .
on thursday , facebook claimed that adblockin new filters were worrying , because they would prevent a portion of the site other than the ad content .
&quot; this is not a good experience for people , and we have plans to address the problem , &quot; facebook said in an e-mail statement .
ad blockers are boring tools , which is why we have instead focused on building tools such as ad preferencesin management people .
the woman was left in a car with the engine on the road apparently committed suicide due to the
the victim was lying on the freeway in the middle of the night .
police looking for witnesses after a woman was left on the freeway for several of the vehicle under the early hours on thursday in the case , which was apparently a suicide .
the incident occurred in the canton of vaud , near the a1 road morges &apos;ta just after midnight on thursday .
the woman made a &quot; desperate act &quot; and settled down in the dark to lie down on the road , where he was hit by a number of means of transport , the vaud police said in a statement .
the victim , who clearly was trying to kill himself , was a 49-year-old swiss woman , which was hit by several vehicles , including a truck-car .
he died on the scene .
a number of drivers to the entry has already been tried , but all have yet to be identified , told the police that will appeal to them and to all the todistaneita who witnessed the incident , to come forward .
the criminal investigation has been opened , what is a &quot; logical &quot; step in this kind of situation , lawyer gilles hofstetter told le tribune de genevelle .
&quot; it remains to be seen , however , whether one of the drivers in the indictment of any individual through forensic evidence .
whether it was possible to avoid a collision ?
it will be referred to the public prosecutor , &quot; hofstetter said .
in the last five years , two similar cases suggest that drivers are not considered to be responsible for .
in both cases-both of which was the person who walked in the dark on the freeway , it was estimated that motorists will not be able to expect a pedestrian on a highway in the middle of the night , the journal said .
last year the police regarding the death caused by the negligence of fault on the part of pardoned her after hitting and after killing the man , who was lying on a road near the paynernea ! one night in august 2014 .
the 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had gone out on the road , the court was told .
the court ruled that a police officer who was responding to an emergency call , drove a reasoned manner , and that the man &apos;s presence on the road was a &quot; quite exceptional and unpredictable situation , &quot; the judge said .
all , that is about thursday &apos;s incident near morges &apos;ta , should call the police number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 .
nasa &apos;s climate model : venus was once habitable
nasa &apos;s new climate model estimates , venus was probably once habitable .
scientists at nasa &apos;s goddard institute for space studies developed a model to explore the planet venus-research centre , and a thing of the past by using the tools and algorithms , which are similar to ilmastotutkijoiden with that are used by the .
the model was designed to find out whether it would be venuksella , with vedettömine and carbon dioxide themal baths can be found täyttämine could sometimes be maankaltaiset air kehineen .
scientists have previously suggested that venus &apos; slow speed to explain its thick atmosphere .
but most simulation refers to the fact that the venuksella could have been thin , the terrestrial atmosphere , and it would still have been able to rotate slowly .
the formation of the surface of venus is also considered an early model .
the planet was likely to land in the drier regions , but there was once enough water and the geographical variation in the life of a militaristic and waxy covering protecting the water fast ! .
the early advantage of the atmosphere of venus was also 30 percent less intense sun .
&quot; the slow rotation of the model in the simulation of venus gissin unveiled its day-side to the sun for almost two months at a time , &quot; gissin researcher anthony del genio explained in a news release .
this heats up the surface and produce rain , which creates a thick cloud layer that acts like as protecting the surface of the warmth of the sun .
the end result of global average temperatures are , in fact , a few degrees cooler than the current ones .
the model was produced by the planet venus in the developing stages of the story , which is similar to what in the past had access astrobiologists were assumed .
although venus probably had sometimes reside , it was exposed to the light of liialle heat and ultraviolet for many billions of years .
the oceans evaporated , and the water vapour of the fire by ultraviolet light .
when the hydrogen escaped , there remained only the thick carbon dioxide atmosphere tappavine greenhouse gas ilmiöineen-venus , that nowadays we are familiar with .
the researchers divided the results of the new climate model of venus , geophysical research letters .
patrick roy gives up the avalanche coach willing to
patrick roy quit his job with the colorado avalanche on thursday , coach and hockey affairs deputy director-general of the measures , saying the reason for the lack of impact on the opportunities for the team &apos;s decision-making process .
colorado &apos;s joe sakic , executive vice president / executive director , confirmed the information and said that the team will begin searching for a new coach immediately .
&quot; for the last three years i have done my duty to the colorado avalanche ice hockey affairs as senior vice president and head coach looking forward to , with passion and determination , &quot; the 50-year-old roy said in a statement .
i &apos;ve been thinking about over the summer , a long , hard look at how i could improve this team in order to give it the necessary depth and take it to a higher level .
in order for this to be achieved , in the view of the coach and hockey affairs deputy director-general must be fully in line with that of the organization .
he must also have the opportunity to influence decisions that affect the team &apos;s performance .
these conditions do not currently exist .
sakic , who was recruited by roy &apos;s 23. may 2013 , thanked royta for his contribution to the team .
&quot; patrick told me today of its decision , &quot; sakic said .
we appreciate all that he has done for the benefit of the organization , and we wish him good luck in the future .
roy was named the league &apos;s best coach to jack adams award during its 2013-14 the first prize for the avalanche .
he led the team to the victory in the central division , 112 , and but the the minnesota brought down the colorado in the first round of the playoffs , and the team have in the past two years .
the avalanche games period 2015-16 ended in defeat and victory , 39 39 4 equality in the game , and the team lost by five points to wildille , thus losing the western conference wild-card playoff spot .
hall of fame selected goalie roy won four stanley cups with the montreal canadiens , as well as the avalanche-two .
north sea oil workers continue their negotiations and postpone strike
due to north sea oil workers työtaisteluita salary is deferred , when all parties will sit down for a new round , the lead negotiators said .
strikes in the oil field services company wood group royal dutch shell have been held occasionally led the north sea rigs .
&quot; wood group and unite and rmt unions can confirm that we have agreed to resume the process , which is aimed at the solution of the current conflict , &quot; the joint statement read .
we consider the following a few weeks during a series of meetings throughout the day from early next week , so that we can take a fresh approach to the problems .
the recent industrial action of trade unions according to their actions , which they say is the first for more than 25 years , was a protest against the wage cuts of up to 30 % of the potential , .
this year , the wood group cut premiums by about 9 % of the contractors in the north sea a negative due to the pressure of the market .
the company &apos;s premium reduction will follow a reduction of 10 % of the countries of the contractors for the year 2014 .
the company said that more cuts would give the company the necessary space for the market to overcome the slowdown .
shell , in turn , has reduced the pay of thousands of people laid off and announced plans to leave the oil and gas operations in the country for up to 10 , when the company lighten its operations as a result of the merger of the british energy company bg group left .
energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , and this situation is aggravated by the british decision to go to the economic kesäkuullinen of the european union .
a scottish member of parliament dave anderson met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the largest in the north sea , and this has jeopardized a generation .
he said that the north sea is essential for the economy of the region .
&quot; we need an economy that works for many people , and not just a select few , so the north sea than in the whole country , &quot; he said in a statement .
the north sea is expected in 2016 for less than 1.4 billion-dollar investments in new projects , while the average of the last five years has been about $ 7 billion .
kepler will measure stellar rotation speed of the pleiadian star among the
most the kepler space telescope mission has helped astronomers of her period to collect the most complete list of the pleiadian star in a series of stellar rotation speeds for your .
the new data will help astronomers of her period to understand why the star of a series of stars that revolve at varying speeds , as well as how the cycle times associated with planet formation .
&quot; we hope that by comparing the results with other star , we learn now more star mass , its age , and even the relationship between the history of the solar system , &quot; caltech infrared processing and analysis beyond pasadena , the center &apos;s researcher luisa rebull said in a press release
the pleiadian star cluster is 445 light years from earth .
many of the stars are born with a set of about 125 million years ago and are just now reaching adulthood .
they revolve around the now top level .
huippupyörimisnopeudellaan these are the stars of adult learning , plunging into large amounts of stellar wind .
when these winds pass through the stellar magnetic fields , they are holding back the stars .
when the speed of rotation of the star , it begins to slow down .
kepler will measure each star speed by following the appearance of the commas , such as recognisable star to the sun .
most of the stars in the speed of rotation of the list suggests that the massiivisemmat of the stars rotating more slowly than less massive stars .
rebull compare the stars , bigger tanssijoihin are doing pirouettes at a lower rate than the smaller ones .
&quot; that time &quot; at the ballet &quot; , we see that the slow pyörijät tend to be more solid , while the fastest in the pyörijät are usually very light of the stars , &quot; rebull said .
as the pleiadian star cluster is so close , it is an ideal laboratory for the assessment of the properties of the cosmic stars , rotational speeds .
&quot; the pleiadian star offers a set of theoretical models of stellar rotation anchor , covering both directions , younger and older , &quot; rebull said .
we still have a lot to learn about how , when and why the stars are slowing down the rotation speed , and , as it were , put &apos; dance shoes &apos; manor houses .
rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of the pleiadian rotational speeds in three article , which will be published shortly in the astronomical journal .
