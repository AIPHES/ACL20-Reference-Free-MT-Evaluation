russia also turkey : outside consortium ?
gesture , each close to crisis .
russia and turkey &apos;s leaders they meet tuesday shake second and declare eight months take words also economic sanctions fight officially all over .
but vladimir putin greet to turkish colleague peter &apos;s palace in golden hall , i let clear impression to conceive , that in ankara is liked this reconciliation more .
yea , in opportunity shake .
but putin &apos;s smile say contrived , nor he just neither exude heat , even own low-key standards with .
recep tayyip erdogan that with only speak away &quot; from dear friend &quot; from putin - five repeats some &apos;s report with .
i snap in bills .
he also swear , that relations russia with they sear non only crisis forego to level , instead even poor .
next day newspapers here they exposit erdoganin conduct , than nothing evil do not ages happen neither .
from own mind he &apos;s enthusiasm reflect opposite .
but from putin emit coolness show , that russia &apos;s leader do not forgotten nothing .
self in matter crisis &apos;s reason did first matter , who he mentioned in opening speech turn : when turkey shot downwards russian taistelulentokone syyria &apos;s border .
moscow &apos;s reaction then did furious .
putin attacked accuse ankara that , that the stab moscow selkään .
insult did even evil , when the came from supposed friend .
real confidence modernisation comes do difficult , maybe impossible .
russian great public opinion do also changed november to scent .
months i lead state manage media lead eye-popping , thorough attack ankara i respond .
suddenly affect that , that turkish did syypää to all .
serious did high mandarins charges that , that erdoganin own family do benefited illegal oil from trade isisin govern from &lt; pl &gt; syria &apos;s regions .
he do banned this painokkaasti .
but pietarinen official message did , that do time to move on .
final final this meeting happen alone that , that putin let call apology &apos;s president erdoganilta .
russia achieve somesuch award .
strict cease-fire agreement &apos;s benefits do clear .
firstly also erdogan need all possible friends so to scent , when they nigh supersede vallasta past moon in abortive coup .
steady terroristihyökkäys in turkka do also palpably rattle tail .
addition do existing economic motive .
russia &apos;s financial punishment do did heavy , notably ban to tilauslento , who usually bearing multiple million russian tourists turkey &apos;s coast annually .
number do set nigh 90 points .
behalf russia local matkanjärjestäjä also tilauslento companies do certainly relieved , when flights from end they continue .
they they hope late season dash to mediterranean .
also already in this in week state &apos;s tv set do predicted cheap fruits also vegetables so to scent , when agricultural product &apos;s import from turkka again is allowed .
&quot; you turistaa there , tomatoes back here &quot; , like vedemosti-newspaper &apos;s report format .
mutta in visit did also political lisäarvo to moscow .
in ankara do to angry western country that , what is lengthen weak answer assay to coup .
when that is increased long taken resentment snail &apos;s momentum roll eu-jäsenneuvotteluista , open enters putin , each do yeasty to utilise coolness and to rag turkey &apos;s ties to western country .
russia &apos;s leader sure let irtopiste from ankara , to who he call revolution company to scent support appointed authorities .
toki this indeed do conclusion to moscow , in who do own syvään entrenched fear power from switch .
ergo this meeting showy seaside in palace enable russia also with turkka present &quot; outside consortium &quot; , like some analyst describe situation to me : two countries , who they experience western country strand them and treat them wrong , linking force .
in this two do though great dissensions no matter from public reconciliation .
key problem do syria , in who moscow do recently reconciled self peacemaker &apos;s role , but in who russia also turkey they support opposite stave .
you can do telling , that nigh three hours working talks to scent , presidents they tell to press , that heh did not even wield matter .
turkey &apos;s president avoided purposely respond to question join they &apos;s dissension , when again putin elect heddle &apos;s emphasizing .
do not clear understanding that , from what heh they feel to look from coupling bases syria &apos;s relation .
months open hostility to scent , and when is taken to attention possibility to full disaster nato limb with turkka shoot downwards russian taistelulentokone , do certainly better , that two leaders do again even in speech lag .

lonely , middle-aged men they love vinyls .
beforehands you dart to meet comment section in cross insults , who &apos;s author do pen name eikaikkiyksinäisetkeski-ikäisetmiehet , tells , that this argument bases to real informations .
yougov along far spoken discs new coming does not stem that , that yet multiple in this in millenary born they dynamize physical objects from novelty , instead keski age kaiho .
apparently this , who do lähiaika bought vinyylilevy , do likely 45-54 -year-old .
self in matter kaikista unlikely discs they buy 18-24 to -year-old age group hearing .
question do not neither only enthusiasts &apos;s collecting , instead that includes feeling marked : old vinyls buyers slightly todennäköisemmin they shall feeling in ( 56 % &lt; sent &gt; &lt; sg &gt; &lt; nom &gt; vs 53 % &lt; sent &gt; &lt; sg &gt; &lt; nom &gt; ) also enjoying from agromania ( 69 % &lt; sent &gt; &lt; sg &gt; &lt; nom &gt; vs 66 % &lt; sent &gt; &lt; sg &gt; &lt; nom &gt; ) .
but must yougov &apos;s results places ?
if this blog is television &apos;s news report , camera follows me , when i walk midst windy street in soho , supra austere gray suit . i sign vivace beforehands i stop , i formulate cup &apos;s hand and i say something authoritative , like : &quot; is examined indeed matter precise &quot; .
is examined indeed matter precise .
to same time , when soho &apos;s charm also filth slowly is removed - hotels , chain restaurants and -trades and office utensil movements they meet now buildings , in who prior did independent movements - handful posh specialise levykauppa do yet in scent .
next section for apparently i ask camera to stop filming &apos;s moment , when i stand very around different men in something from this from trades try to assess by observing they &apos;s age also feeling temperament .
glasgowlainen stuart , 55 , jota to bee sister from ray ( scaler : two nascent woman , three middle-aged man ) reckless recordsiin ( scaler : eight middle-aged man , one i marry , likely twenty ) , celebrates to afternoon in london meeting &apos;s flow , and travels trades consume few &apos;s hour .
i ask , do he collector .
&quot; kai what do &quot; , he says .
in me do some 3000 or 4000 discs .
this discs , who they show in picture reach ( he send sample &apos;s e-mail , do not follow tail to huts ) , they conceal he &apos;s bedsitter walls .
reason so huge disc also loner number to procurance do partly consequence him wearable from being incomes : now he feels to buy discs , to who in him non did reserves with silla , when this originally publish , and he feels to buy new this , who he sell do nascent also penniless .
&quot; great part buy from &lt; sg &gt; materiaalistaa do late 60 figures also early 70 figures , discs , who publish , when did 11 or 12 , discs , who &apos;s procurance did sure enough slightly too nascent &quot; , he says .
he do same mind that , that discs &apos;s buyers do todennäköisemmin introverted , who they enjoy from own bee , and increases : &quot; do not burn not you drink much .
this do i &apos;s vice &quot; .
25 -year-old wez , each works sister in ray , also believes , that many him face customers they agree yougov &apos;s profile .
he do though told new wave humans , to who media &apos;s enthusiasm do affected . humans , who do heard , that discs do come again to fashion also to who do come need to buy old discs old .
käymä talks according to humans do shake off eroon from collection usually year 1998 or 1999 .
customers , who they sell vinyl buy cd-levy , they sell now cd buy disc old &quot; , he says .
this can to explain certain aged vinyl awakened number reproduction .
but entäpä discs alleged feeling essence ?
phonican in like trade takes few &apos;s second to realise , that levykauppa they offer comforting community to like-minded types .
wezin with any old customers do hurt particularly near from payment system .
any vinyl fans they feel to häkeltyä from digital world and to elect swear familiar disc decks &apos;s fixity ; to objects , who they raise teen age onnenpäivä &apos;s memories .
&quot; i reckon , that sometimes that you can do question gap &apos;s inflation or from somesuch solace , what &apos;s objects ownership creates &quot; , wez says .
self also collector i grant , that this do truth , and i believe so being truth to many to humans .
the do easy step to meet drift .

no one does not look this - ehkäpä that , that this do only decorations , and any do so high , that this concern do impossible .
in question do purely &quot; art vinyls &quot; .
but when is taken to attention , that this &apos;s objects let small also attention feels to mean addition money to industry and to send few customers soho &apos;s whirlpool to apply increases , in this do not much neither complaint .
does not come surprise , that the väestönosa , in who do other todennäköisemmin more while also money , do also the , each uses most to luxury objects , like to vinyls .

not a bit paint two games sounds from indelible achievement , but 27 -year-old bam say , unless not do sure , did he earlier made same .
&quot; in me do not to glimmer behind &quot; , he say .
&quot; not from right do such human , each must enters from paints &quot; .
but this he knows : american do 4-0 situations in olympialaiset tourney and heh sharing group first place britain with , each did yet unbeaten defeated on thursday japan 2-0 .

both teams do to resolved neljännesvälierä , and this game solves , who locates first and who second them six teams in group .
first located avoids strong dutch , second group leader , slightly longer quarter finals begin .
how whatever saturday &apos;s game closes , american do raised stir in surprising success here , four years so to scent , when heh they stay london &apos;s olympian terminally 12 teams .
bam did on that in team .
he grew pennsylvania &apos;s bread in bell and cull field hockey bat hands first repeats 3 -year-old ( he old kaksoissisar they play ilk drexelissä ) in connection with to national team 16 -year-old , when from him come its all &apos;s times nascent player .
he did not aboard year 2008 olympian , since does not reach along final player to list .
year 2012 nothing does not go to him and he &apos;s team to comrades .
next year english craig parnham appointed coach , also matters began to change .
&quot; culture &apos;s change , i breathe change , physical change &quot; , bam say .

trampoline &apos;s peace olympialaiset frenzy midst
where whatever do neither , which whatever time do neither , olympian do in visit .
rio de janeiro &apos;s events they seem steady also inevitable , furious competition also struggle &apos;s message .
hard like self olympiasoihtu is flaming baton , who is conveyed from archer to bather also from gymnast triathlonistille .
do impossible to put atop television , to read sanomat leaf tai to listen vierustoveri &apos;s talk teashop &apos;s queue air , that hears simone bilesista , katie ledeckysta or michael phelpsin and chad le clos &quot; s from intermediate road rage .
and ago do logan dooley .
dooley , olympian &apos;s tyro also coming lady killer alongside dimple , can in fact do ~ a from this all tell from &lt; pl &gt; from names , who is presented best katselu to time and who supporting sponsor agreements and good mind tv set adverts - if he do bather , gymnast or even fencer .
but california lake forestista cosy being dooley , 28 , competes from olympiakulta in trampoline .
olympia flame does not illume all ilk as much .
farther from centre , partly in shadow , do this ilk , who all not generally adopt : ilmapistooliammunta , archery , shuttle , taekwondo .
in mei do always breaststroke , long the lives .
but if i let to make moderate number special from favourite , i like to tack attention &apos;s trampoline to low-key charm .
albeit trampoline do do olympialaji from year 2000 , when the make first appearance sydney &apos;s games , so presence do between worn 16 years during attentions so a bit , that many , who i interview , do not realise at all so being olympialaiset ilk .
this can do regional ignorance .
albeit u.s. do sent athletes to compete in ilk , the do not never superior on that medal , nor so athlete proceed to final until beforehands year 2012 .
chinese also russian sharing usually men , chinese also canadian women medals .
this year china &apos;s dong dong and canada rosie mclennan they defend london &apos;s gold medal .
to trampoline joins though certain underdog allure , pound off that , that barbaric i replace the to sound appropriate better to clown school like to olympian .
in this me must to recognise , that do not expert , do only unairworthy fan .
in ilk do possibilities to huvittavuus , like is told toon interminable bounce from shimmy , but that do also gymnastics also uimahyppy &apos;s gracility , together ilk , who on that in principle they combine .
word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes spanish &apos;s word el trampolín , each means springboard .
championship &apos;s aspirant they skip in gigantic trampoline even nigh 30 afoot to height , and them comes to engage twirl liikesarja ( translations , layout also volts ) also from end to land to feet .
official olympian programme with them is assessed implementation , difficulty and &quot; lentoaika &quot; according to .
in rio competes 32 athletes 17 countries , 16 men also 16 women .
general olympian direction do directly on .
medal pray &lt; pos &gt; must to go gold-plate look long , rapid , up also over - sometimes to paint until , sometimes to and fro around field .
they do not hunt only wire or start wall , instead also , televise in coverage , second gibelike narrow : world or olympiaennätys .
this resolute pursuance do noble , estimable also even fanatic - and the feels to let even seer &apos;s tears .
but the do also reason that , why games &apos;s call also feels do slightly draining .
trampoline offers rest period from this .
trampoline &apos;s direction do up .
objective do not to move on .
competitor rises to new rise affect atonic like astronaut , goes up , now downwards , now effortlessly again up .
hereof non obviously lack competition nor difficulty , but programme during do not rabid dash to to stop , non leaps to distance , or i lead also gravity dreamlike , melting interruption .
the do so around zen mode , like what in olympian can to reach .
women &apos;s karsintakilpailu also now final is worked on friday iltapäivällä sending begin o &apos;clock 13 ( et ) , men &apos;s games they come on saturday also o &apos;clock 13 .
nbc to send finals part afternoon &apos;s software initially clock 14 both day .
olympia daze midst this they offer silent , attractive moment , each likely does not tell in general chaos .
and if awareness is achieved or by offering man athletes gaze and objectify ( like united states &apos;s man gymnasts something time ago they propose the wall street journal with ) , dooley or expects sigh new fan to municipality .
&quot; generation shows mind &quot; in ethiopia , each do usa long-term ally
violent demonstrations in ethiopia
political change in ethiopia exigent demonstrators do faced government violent opposition .
witnesses they say , that ten demonstrators do shot dead police with pass in strife .
do ethiopia breaking ?
last decade during the do do ~ a afrika from stable states , west firm ally , who &apos;s economy grows swiftly .
past months during government anti demonstrations do though rattle to bed spread yet to multiple regions .
alone past in week tuhansittain humans dart to streets call thorough political change .
human right groups along government &apos;s answer did relentless .
witnesses they said , that police they shot and they killed kymmenittäin arm demonstrators .
spread , in demonstrations recorded tapes , who is believed being past year &apos;s end or this &apos;s year format , showing , how security authorities they strike in sticks nascent humans in same , when this force to stand in hands wall against .
united nations end human right authority calls now läpikotainen research .
&quot; this &apos;s country koossa holding did always difficult , also in follow-up the comes do even difficult &quot; , say rashid abdi , each do afrika &apos;s horn projektipäällikkö international crisis group -in tutkimusryhmä .
ethiopia do nigeria &apos;s scent afrika secondly väkirikas country , also western country they assess so stability .
america military also intelligence agency they make close cooperation etiopialainen as well in fight region &apos;s terrorist threats con particularly in somalia , also with pains nothing afrika &apos;s country lets so far western country &apos;s aid .
ethiopia &apos;s economy do grown in impressive momentum .
so infrastructure do improved äärimmäisen far , also capital in addis abeba do even new commuters train .
city &apos;s streets do typically silent , safe also clean .
without no ethiopia do nevertheless do democracy &apos;s model picture . human right organisations do away spoken government &apos;s oppression , country &apos;s opposition do do limited , also dissident do silenced effectively .
monet do cast out from country , jailed , killed or driven far to desert .
but this can do changing .
&quot; if you suppress humans , nor in them do other options than to show mind , i see comes to käymä &quot; , seyoum tes mold , university teacher keski from ethiopia , say .
totally youth shows mind .
one generations shows mind .

kepler measure asters &apos;s revolutions per minute plejadien in tähtijoukko
last kepler-avaruusteleskoopin task do helped astronomers to collect complete listing plejadien tähtijoukko &apos;s asters from revolutions per minute .
new informations they help astronomers to understand , why tähtijoukko &apos;s asters they spin in checkered speeds , and how kiertoaika they join to planet &apos;s muodostus .
&quot; we hope , that by comparing results to other tähtijoukko , we learn now more aster &apos;s mass , so age also even so solar system &apos;s history from intermediate relation &quot; , caltechin infrared &apos;s processing also analysointi &apos;s pasadena centre &apos;s researcher luisa rebull say in press publication
plejadien tähtijoukko lies 445 light year päässä from country .
many number &apos;s asters do born some 125 million years ago , and do just now achieving adulthood .
this they spin now in top-level .
super in revolutions per minute this they grow up asters eject great numbers aster wind .
when this winds they walk asters &apos;s magnetic fields through , this they set back asters .
when aster expire , so revolutions per minute begin to slow up .
kepler measures each &apos;s aster revolutions per minute by following identifiable aster commas &apos;s apparition , like sunspots .
last asters revolutions per minute &apos;s list refers that , that massive asters they spin slow like less massive asters .
rebull comparably asters to dancers , from who big they make pirouette slow like small .
&quot; plejadien &quot; in ballet &quot; we see , that slow pyörijät do usually massive , when again rapid pyörijät do usually very light asters &quot; , rebull say .
since plejadien tähtijoukko do so near , the do ideal cosmic laboratory asters &apos;s characteristics to evaluation in revolutions per minute .
&quot; plejadien tähtijoukko offers anchor &apos;s asters rotation to theoretical models , who they involve both directions , nascent also old &quot; , rebull say .
in mei do yet far larn that , how , when also why asters they slow revolutions per minute also niin sanotusti hanging &apos; dance shoes &apos; to nail .
rebull and he &apos;s colleague they describe last analyysiaan plejadien from revolutions per minute three articles , who is published soon astronomical journal -in publication .
