junior doctors strike : requirements of the new industrial action
doctors in training representatives have asked the unions to accept new labor disputes them in their dispute regarding a new agreement .
the british medical association-medical association &apos;s ( bma ) junior doctors committee ( jdc ) ask the entire council to support the new industrial action at the beginning of september .
jdc said that the ministers have failed to seize the concerns regarding the agreement .
junior doctors and medical students voted in july to reject the contract , which was agreed with the bma .
58 % of the vote of the members rejected it .
on thursday evening via twitter , published a letter to members of jdc &apos;s president ellen mccourt said that the government had remained ” stubbornly silent ” issues , which according to him led to the rejection of the agreement .
he said : ” in light of the jdc &apos;s board of directors has voted to reject entirely the proposed new contract and requires its formal re-negotiations of all of your concerns . ”
in response to the government &apos;s silence jdc &apos;s board of directors has today submitted a formal request to the bma &apos;s special council meeting , so early in september began to gradually advance the mission and expanding the industrial program below to obtain the authorization .
controversy has followed , that the junior doctors are involved in this year , the six strike , including the first complete work stoppage on the nhs-the health care system in history .
the bma &apos;s junior doctors director , doctor johann malawi , resigned after the vote was abandoned , the contract negotiations , the bma &apos;s recommended conditions .
he told bma members meetings prior to the 54 000 doctors in training and student vote , that the agreement was good and it should be accepted .
after the vote , health minister jeremy hunt said that the agreement will be assigned to the english doctors .
russia and turkey : external consortium ?
the gesture , which ended with the crisis .
the russian and turkish leaders met on tuesday to shake hands to each other and to declare eight months of words and economic sanctions battle officially closed .
but vladimir putin was greeted in turkish to his colleague in the st . petersburg palace of the gilded hall , i got a clear impression that ankara is to this reconciliation more .
yes , the occasion to shake hands .
but putin &apos;s smile seemed forced , and he hardly exudes the warmth , even in its own muted standards .
recep tayyip erdogan , by contrast , kept talking about ” our dear friends ” the putin - five times according to one report .
i &apos;ve lost count .
he also vowed that relations with russia would return not only pre-crisis level , but even better .
the next day the newspapers here described erdogan was acting , like nothing bad had ever happened .
in my opinion , his zeal reflected the opposite .
but putin radiant coolness showed that the russian leader has not forgotten anything .
in fact , the crisis of reason was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech : when turkey shot down a russian fighter plane from the syrian border .
moscow &apos;s reaction at the time was furious .
putin attacked the reason for the harsh fact that it stab moscow in the back .
the insult was even worse , when it came to presumed friends .
real confidence rebuilding will be difficult , maybe impossible .
russian public opinion has also changed since november .
for months , the state-controlled media led to mind-boggling , in-depth attack on ankara .
suddenly it seemed that the turks were to blame for everything .
more serious were the senior officials &apos; accusations that erdogan &apos;s own family has benefited from the illicit oil trade isis control the syrian territories .
he has denied this emphatically .
but in st . petersburg , the official message was that it is time to move forward .
after all , this meeting is happening only because putin got the required apology to president erdogan .
russia achieved some sort of victory .
the harsh armistice agreement , the benefits are clear .
firstly , erdogan needs all the friends it after , when he was almost ousted from power in last month &apos;s failed coup .
the continuing terrorist attacks in turkey are also clearly shaken him .
in addition , there is a financial motive .
the russian economic sanctions have been heavy , especially the ban on charter flights , which usually carry several million russian tourists to the turkish coast each year .
the number has decreased by almost 90 % .
for russia , the local tour operators and charter flight companies will definitely be relieved when the flight will eventually continue .
they are hoping for a late season rush to the mediterranean sea .
and already this week the state tv is predicted to cheaper fruit and vegetables after that , when imports of agricultural products from turkey once again allowed .
” the tourists there , the tomatoes back here , ” as the vedemosti newspaper report design .
but the visit also had political value for moscow .
ankara is angry at the west for what is considered to be weak in response to yritettyyn coup .
when it is added to the long endured resentment at a snail &apos;s pace the progress of eu membership negotiations , along comes putin , who is eager to take advantage of coolness and to erode turkey &apos;s ties with the west .
the russian leader certainly got points in ankara , where he called the revolution of the company after the support order to the designated authority .
of course , this is an axiom of moscow , which has its own deep-rooted fears for the transfer of power .
so this meeting with the royal seaside palace made it possible for russia and turkey presented by the ” external consortium ” , as one analyst described the situation to me : two countries , who experience the west abandoned them and treated them wrong , in their .
these two are , however , large differences despite the public reconciliation .
the key issue is syria , where moscow has recently reconciled themselves with the peacemaker role , but in which russia and turkey support opposing sides .
can be a lot of talk that the nearly three-hour preliminary discussions , the presidents told the press that they had not even discussed the matter .
turkish president avoided consciously to answer the question related to their erimielisyyksiinsä , while putin chose as their highlights .
there is no clear understanding about where they can find common ground with syria .
after months of open hostility , and when taken into account the possibility of a full disaster nato-member turkey to shoot down russian combat aircraft , it is certainly better that the two leaders are again even on speaking terms .
royal bank of scotland goes missing , the scottish external customers
the bank &apos;s ceo , according to the rbs brand will be reduced to a back office role .
royal bank of scotland goes missing , the scottish external customers .
ross mcewan told the bbc scotland that the rbs brand joined the bank &apos;s international ambitions .
after the bank almost collapsed eight years ago , and it must be saved , it has given up these goals .
bank strategists have used this time for ’ rbs ’ on-brand to help protect other consumer finance brands .
it support millions of international sports sponsorship used pounds , six nations rugby , wimbledon champion andy murray .
but now it is considered correct to give people more of the brands come to the fore .
royal bank of scotland has enabled scottish with customers , but it is not started again from the beginning .
in england and wales , all the rbs-a reference to the head office and stock exchange listings , except for changing the natwestin .
ulster bank brand is already in use in ireland and northern ireland customers .
there are other , smaller private banking brands that get more visibility : coutts , adam &amp; co . , drummond as well as holt &apos;s military bank .
mcewan by the interviewed customers and staff round of the inverness-shire .
he told bbc scotland : ” rbs-the brand becomes the investor in our brand and our employees to the employer , because now we are becoming much more brand of the bank . ”
when the bank itself to become a global brand , rbs became a global brand .
to say , therefore , that we no longer have global goals , we have local goals .
each of these brands means something very different in their communities , and our staff working with clients with these brand below .
rbs has already said that it will not resume the six nations sponsorship , and it has brought a different brand of profile sports sponsorship .
” now is the time to move on to brand the bank in the direction , because , in essence , ( we are asked ) it is about how we can focus on doing this customers a better bank ” , the ceo said .
three years ago i was very cynical , if we had said that we are going to be a great bank for customers and to offer these brands .
but it work with what we have done , focused on customer needs , not our own , i believe that you can see a lot of changes .
we can bring those brands back , so i think that the time is right .

russia &apos;s putin to dismiss the chief of staff sergei ivanov
russian president vladimir putin has unexpectedly fired chief of staff sergei ivanov .
ivanov has been part of putin &apos;s trusted inner circle for many years .
63-year-old has now been appointed to the environmental and transport affairs special representative .
the kremlin statement said that putin is ” ordered ivanov to move away from the russian presidential administration , the director &apos;s tasks ” , but this was not given a reason .
ivanov &apos;s deputy director since 2012 , anton persecution , has been named as his successor .
persecution , 44 , is a former diplomat .
he was born in the estonian capital tallinn in 2012 , graduated from the prestigious moscow state institute of international relations institute ( mgimo ) and the tokyo embassy .
later he led the presidential protocol and government staff , said the kremlin website ( russian ) .
when he was appointed , he said to putin : ” thanks for the vote of confidence . ”
i think the administration &apos;s main task is to support you in your activities as head of state , what will be the law of the sketching as well as help implementation management .
putin told a russian tv station on friday that ivanov was asked to leave his position and recommended that the persecution would be appointed in his place .
are you a smile you convincing ?
this is a business that has baffled moscow .
sergei ivanov has long been one of vladimir putin &apos;s closest allies and , like putin , served in the soviet security service kgb .
as chief of staff he was one of the country &apos;s most influential men .
state television showing a meeting with president putin , both men claimed that the chief of staff withdrew to the side at his own request .
but despite hymyilystä for the cameras , only a few people here are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so is this just some kind of power struggle traces the swell ?
no one yet knows .
but the official claim that the man that i once was advertised as a potential presidential candidate , wants to suddenly lead to a russian environmental policy , is taken against the really sceptical .
the kremlin website quoted in his comments to putin , ivanov said ” it is true that early in 2012 , i ask you in conversation to give four years responsibility for this very complex , i wish we could even say tedious , task .
well , now i &apos;ve been chief of staff for four years and eight months . ”
ivanov approved the mission in december 2011 .
he previously served as deputy prime minister and defense minister .
he is a member of the russian security council and former member of the state security service , the kgb , like putin .
in the late 1990s , when putin was director of the state security service fsb , which replaced the kgb , ivanov was appointed as his deputy director .
when putin rose to power , he cited ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most .
once it was thought that ivanov could become the russian president putin for the second season after , for putin third term would be unconstitutional .
this task , however , went to another of putin &apos;s close ally , dmitry medvedev .
putin became prime minister before his return to run for president just three and a half years later .

this was done by pulling the north pathway viaduct 700 millimeters in the south direction .
this was a huge and at the same time a very demanding measure .
huge , because the viaduct is 222 meters long , weighs about 6000 tons and it had to pull about a 3 % slope angle .

pokémon go is the respect of health and happy hunting
it &apos;s fascinating to see how the world is changing .
over the past decade , many have to worry about it , that teenagers and children no longer went out to play , but that they prefer to spend their free time in the screens looking at .
pokémon go get people to get up off the couch and participate in some activities .
screen time was limited originally to a tv , then video games and now recently , smartphones .
it is so amazing to see that technology and open-air activity are not mutually exclusive .
i refer , of course , this fad called the pokémon go . the application , which is based on the character , which was originally developed in the 1990s for video games ( the later ones born in the cartoon series , playing cards and other downstream products ) .
like many pop-culture phenomenon , its popularity was to some extent diluted before this new game released in the united states , australia and new zealand early in july .
after the game &apos;s release in other countries will be postponed , because the huge popularity of overloaded servers .
just a day in the pokémon golla was users more than tinderillä and almost as much as twitter .
how does it work ?
in a nutshell , explained players use älypuhelimiaan while looking pokémon , which are tracked by gps , and that after the discovery of can be ” photographed ” ( phone screenshot ) , or ” catch ” .
the generation that played the game at a younger age , have joined the craze and jumped up from the couch to join the search .
in the united states the game has led to a significant increase in ” average person &apos;s ” daily step in .
apple watch app cardiogram , which follows the 35 000 users , recently told the washington post that in two days the game is released in 30 minutes a day of moving , the number of people jumped 45 % to 53 % of the cardiogram to follow where clients .
the company does not know who play pokémon gota , it sees only the training level information .
many public health campaigns , prompting the ” find 30 ” , ” get off the couch ” and ” be active every day ” have not yielded any result for the reason that the majority of public health warnings is boring and they care about the people who look miserable .
the importance of physical activity cannot be underestimated .
regularly mobile have a lower risk of developing cancer or depression .
activity helps control weight , high blood pressure and diabetes . its advantages are too many to list here .
pokémon gon beauty of it is that it gets people to go out and do something , which they enjoy .
this will be covered by health three pillars : exercise , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even get hunting for new friends .
as a rule , disapprove of the joy of players looking for this things to complain about .
yes , someone can walk into a door .
then what ?
there &apos;s been a breakthrough .
although previously had a fitbit-like apps that can monitor the activity , they did not give a reason for movement in the same way as this game .
the novelty wears off and the use of subsides in due course .
pokémon &apos;s success therefore becomes , however , other games that combine applications and virtual reality in the real world of activity , helping many forests indicated that the dinosaurs people to be more active , in better shape and healthier .

simone biles grabbed the gold medal in women &apos;s gymnastics in many of the match
forget the pressure .
forget julkisuuskohu .
simone biles is immune to it all .
energetic jumps .
the smooth boom .
incredible main floor .
brilliant everywhere .
and now , finally , the olympic champion .
19-year-old american gymnast reached many matches in the championship on thursday , leaving himself and the rest of the world to bridge the gap between out of the olympic spotlight .
he total their points , 62.198 , were clearly better , than the silver medalist and the ” final five ” -teammate aly raisman and russian bronze medalist aliya mustafina .
american simone biles balance beam women &apos;s artistic gymnastics of the many match individuals in the finals of the 2016 summer olympics in brazil &apos;s rio de janeiro on thursday .
biles became the fourth american woman , which is sequentially won many matches in the championship , and overall , the fifth american champion . at the same time he strengthened his reputation generation , and perhaps of all time , best .
he burst into tears when her final score was announced , and his long journey towards this moment ended .
this achievement brought her to the same category of the other generation &apos;s best athletes , like michael phelps , who have brought their species to a new level :
biles has dominated their sport for the last three years , winning 15 world championship medals , including 10 gold , the programme , whose ambition and precision of the mix has been so stupendous that the 1984 olympic champion mary lou retton called him the ” best by to voimistelijaksi ” .
the last experience was waiting in brazil , the competition , which was not so much the biles and other competitors , but his and excessive expectations burden .

american simone biles , left , and aly raisman hug after winning gold and silver medals ( in that order ) women &apos;s gymnastics of the many match individuals in the finals of the 2016 summer olympics in brazil &apos;s rio de janeiro on thursday , aug .
biles reached the first medal on tuesday , when he served as the climax to the retired national team coordinator , martha karolyi , the output of the party .
although biles claimed that he has never thought about the future while passing through the long way to the top , it is not entirely truthful .
part of his floor exercise programme , which included his trademark somersault bypass - is adapted to the latin american music , which is perfect for the street is the rio olympic arena .
this is not a coincidence .
this girl , with her grandparents adopted taaperona , and by the coach , aimee boorman &apos;s mother found , when she was on a study trip to the gym , where boorman coached , has become a power factor .
he hasn &apos;t lost many games in the summer of 2013 , and this winning streak is likely to continue as long as biles wants .
while mustafina had a small lead after two laps , it was only an illusion .
balance the boom and the main floor , where biles is the reigning world champion , were waiting .
she rose to the tip of the boom with points 15.433 and exceeded them by getting 15.933 the main floor .
raisman hugged him good-naturedly , while they waited for a final score - a mere formality - and the tears rose bilesiin glitter in red , white and blue limited eyes , when you dream , where he once wrote in the scrapbook , came true .
raisman &apos;s performance was some sort of rematch of four years ago , when he was shared third place , but lost in the bronze-mustafina for the re-run .
this time the 22-year-old team leader , which the americans call ” grandma ” , was clearly in the lead .
she sent air kisses to the audience parterre performance after the emotion of the return , which was of questionable .
what bilesiin will , this 19-year-old widespread tweeting earlier this week gets a whole new meaning :

mikrokefaliaa sick 6-year-old mother : ” the situation easier ”
edmund picciuto , like most of the other six years old , i love to sing , toys and , of course , his mother .
but , unlike the majority of the peers , edmund is a little stubborn . this is the result of a genetic disorder , which his mother , elizabeth picciuto , did not know she was pregnant .

i can &apos;t do this .
i didn &apos;t sign up for this .

it is too early to say how it will affect zika-infected life .
picciuto remember the uncertain future caused by the emotional load .
i was just asking , what &apos;s going to happen .
what &apos;s going to happen ?
and he actually still do not know .
in fact , i have asked the prognosis at the time , because i don &apos;t expect that anybody would be able to kind to me really to give .
but picciutolla is hope for the rich advice for mothers whose babies have zika due to a birth defect .
the situation becomes easier .
can you believe that the situation becomes easier .
you love your child , and your child will love you .

why do we need simone , gabby and laurie
thus , the invitation to this year &apos;s women &apos;s olympic gymnastics teams , more than one reason .
firstly , i &apos;ve been in every summer olympics since 1984 , and the u.s. have never been this dominant .
and secondly : this team is involved in the three gymnasts , simone biles , gabby douglas and lauren ” laurie ” hernandez , who are inspired by the many colored girls .
this team &apos;s composition , which the jew aly raisman and catholic madison koci to complement , gets all proud .
this team looks like , finally , to america .
it has also established dark-skinned and latin american women &apos;s involvement in species at the top .
over the past four years , the most successful woman gymnast has been african-american .
last year simone and gabby were first and second .
this is awesome .
last olympics gabby douglas surprised the olympic winners , and america cheered .
now the world has been witness to triple world champion simone bilesiin , douglas and laurie hernandez amazing performance , which they presented unexpected , but masterful gymnastics programs .
thursday , simone became the fourth american woman , which is sequentially won the individual gold in the women many match .
and teammate aly raisman got the silver .
we see species peak , but the situation doesn &apos;t look like this gym in different parts of the country .
simone , gabby and laurie walk all the same path , as aly and madison on reaching the olympic team .
they are the ” final five ” ( the last five ) , because in the next olympics gymnastics team will be only four gymnasts , and this is marta karolyi &apos;s last year as coach .
however , the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport , and gymnasts are training as a rule , in private gymnastics clubs , run by parents , who pay for coaching , facilities , travel , uniforms , competition fees , hotel charges ( coaches and their gymnastics friends and families ) and the list goes on .
a large part of these gymnastic clubs are located in wealthy suburban neighborhoods in areas that can support species .
these clubs gymnasts get all the coach , and this is the most expensive and long-term commitment to the gymnasts &apos; families .
aimee boorman , simone bilesiin coach , as well as maggie haney , laurie hernandez , the coach , are both trained in sports than ever since they started gymnastics .
we will bring more affordable and available to a gymnastics coaching communities in which they live simone , gabby and laurie excited by numerous young girls .
based on the gymnastics foundation of my 20 years ago .

in september we are expanding to detroit ( my hometown ) to provide a high level of gymnastics for the young , who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this important olympic sport .
gymnasts develop body strength , flexibility and coordination , as well as hard work , discipline and determination .
this combination provides lifelong benefits for good health as well as education and työmenestys .
this team inspired to get thousands of young girls to start gymnastics , and it &apos;s awesome .
sports participation is so important , especially for girls .
we live in an exciting time .
thank you simone , aly , laurie , gabby , and madison the fact that you are showing a serious ” girl power ” by winning the olympic team gold , and that you motivate so many , from different backgrounds , the young girls started on the road toward a healthy , strong and successful young women .

the first intern , you will be transferred to the new agreement , which includes changes in nocturnal and weekend work practices to improve the care of the tricky hours .
dr. ellen mccourt , the bma &apos;s junior doctors committee chairman , said last night in the statement : ” junior doctors are still serious concerns related to the proposed agreement , especially the fact that it accelerates the existing labour crisis , and that it does not treat all doctors equally . ”
when the time before the first group of doctors will be transferred to the new agreement is left for only eight weeks , progress must happen and time is running out .
bma : n attempts to resolve the dispute through negotiations have faced government reluctance to participate and at times in deep silence .
thus , despite jeremy hunt &apos;s pledge last month that his door is always open .
” jeremy hunt must act now to remove the sanctions and take into account junior doctors concerns .
if he does not do so , doctors in training are ready to continue the industrial action .
the last strike at the end of april meant nearly 13 000 routine surgery and 100 000 reception time of adjournment , when the nurses and consult with physicians were recruited to work the picket line of doctors deputy .

daniel mortimer , nhs employers -the employer organisation , the ceo appealed to the trainee doctors , so they don &apos;t go on strike .

thousands of heart attack patients have the benefit of about two pounds in a day to pay the medicine , after authorities recommended that it is given to people longer .
blood clotting drug , ticagrelor , drop a renewable risk of seizures in people with heart disease .
the drug is administered for 12 months after a heart attack to a stroke or another stroke risk drops .
nhs : n supervisor nice has advised that it should give people a period of four years , in order to still decrease heart and blood vessel problems the risk .
but now nhs : n supervisor nice has advised that it should give people a period of four years , in order to still decrease heart and blood vessel problems the risk .
about 140 000 people get every year of a heart attack in england , and a quarter of these get a second attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stroke due to the artery wall from the accumulated fatty material that form restrictions .
if the stenosis is torn , it can cause blood clots that block blood flow to the heart causing a heart attack .
if the clot becomes loose , it can pass through the blood and cut off blood supply to the brain , causing a stroke .
persons who have already received one scene , there is an increased risk of getting another .
ticagrelor , which produced a british company astrazeneca , and which is sold under the trade name brilique , to lower this risk by making clotting less likely .
published today , nice &apos;s guidance is in the draft , it is recommended that people be given 90 mg ticagreloria 12 months , followed by 60 mg of aspirin with taken twice a day for the next two years .
professor carole ueki , nice &apos;s health technology evaluation centre director , said : ” despite the effective progression of preventive care availability , up to a quarter of heart attack in people receiving receive later another heart attack or stroke , the consequences of which are often disastrous . ”
relapse fear can have a considerable negative impact on a person &apos;s quality of life .
the evidence shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is an effective count to the later heart attack and stroke risk people who have already had a heart attack .
recommend we develop a preliminary ticagreloria we are pleased to be able to increase the available treatment options for a number of thousands of them potentially useful to people .
because ticagrelorin data on efficacy and safety - in particular , what will be the risk of bleeding over a three-year period are limited , the guidance in the draft is not recommended for treatment longer than this period of time .

wright became a well-known bowel sustainability of the tester on his travels around the world and eating weird and wonderful things .
this public railway station to the railing of the toilet-seat flush button reaching task , indeed , to test his immune system .
in the movie he said : ” since i was a kid i &apos;ve been pretty carefree about my health , and i have put in my mouth all kinds of things with dirt , worms , and kuraisesta the water from . ”
he really established his reputation during the movie .
the only thing , which he refused , was filthy russian public toilet .
his näytteessään was fotometrissä more than 4,000 units to read .
in comparison , only washed his hands of the reader should be less than 60 .
but in one russian public toilet he wouldn &apos;t lick it , though , when fotometrin results showed more than 4,000 units , and only washed his hands of the result is less than 60 .
wright has produced the traveler &apos;s film , the internal strength of the track , together with the finnish dairy , valio . in the film , showing the number of bacteria in various places , such as in the bathroom .
in the film , he said : ” this is almost the worst thing i &apos;ve smelled in the toilet . ”

i am glad that we got some of those dirty nuolaisuista saved . ”

vinyl destination : who actually purchase the discs ?
a lonely , middle-aged men love vinyl .
before rushing to fill the comments section of ärtyneillä insults , which as a writer is the name of the mark noall lonely middle-aged men , note that this argument based on real data .
yougov &apos;s much talked about album of the new no is due to the fact that more and more in this millennium born in the inspire of physical objects is a novelty , but the average age of kaihosta .
apparently those who have lately purchased a vinyl record , are more likely to be 45-54 years of age .
in fact , all of the less likely the discs bought the 18-24-year-olds age group .
the issue is also not just a hobby of collection , but it includes a feeling of importance : parents of vinyl buyers are a little more likely to keep feelings inside ( 56 % vs 53 % ) and enjoy being alone ( 69 % vs 66 % ) .
but whether yougov &apos;s results accurate ?
if this blog were a television news report , the camera would follow me when i walk in the middle of a busy street in soho , wearing a modest gray suit . sign at lively before i &apos;d stop , forming a cup in my hands and i would say something authoritative , such as : ” let &apos;s examine the matter more closely . ”
let &apos;s examine the issue in more detail .
at the same time , when soho &apos;s charm and dirt is slowly removed - hotels , chain restaurants and shop and office supply store are now in the buildings , which previously were independent movements - a handful of stunning specialized record shops still left .
the next section for probably asking the camera to stop filming for a moment , while standing very close to a variety of men some of these stores trying to assess by observation of their age and feeling temperamenttiaan .
glasgow stuart , of 55 , followed by the sister ray ( the counter : two young women , three middle-aged men ) reckless records ( counter : eight middle-aged men , one woman , probably early twenties ) , spend the afternoon in london for the meeting , and around the shops to pass a few hours .
i ask if she &apos;s a collector .
” i suppose i am , ” he said .
i have about 3000 or 4000 sheet .
these plates , which are visible in the photo above ( he sent a sample by e-mail , i didn &apos;t follow her home ) , covered his living room walls .
the reason for this huge plate and a single amount for the acquisition is partly the result of his disposable income : now she can buy the discs , which he could not afford when they were originally released , and he can re-buy them , which he sold when he was young and penniless .
” a large part of i bought the material from the late &apos; 60s and early &apos; 70s , the discs that were released , when i was 11 or 12 , the plates , the acquisition of which was probably a little too young , ” he said .
he agrees that the plate of buyers are more likely to be introverts , who enjoy their own company , and adds : ” i don &apos;t smoke and i don &apos;t drink much .
this is my guilty pleasure . ”
25-year-old wez , who works for the sisters in ray , also believes that many of his encounters customers fit yougov &apos;s profile .
however , he has noticed a new wave of people , which the media enthusiasm is affected . people who have heard that the boards have come back into fashion and which has become the need to buy the old albums back .
my conversations on the basis of people have gotten rid of their collections , usually in 1998 or 1999 .
customers who sold their vinyylinsä to buy cds , sell now cd to buy the album back , ” he said .
this may explain to a certain age vinyl heränneiden amount of reproduction .
but what about the record of the alleged feeling of importance ?
phonic to such trade takes a few seconds to realize that record stores offer a comforting community for like-minded types .
wezi says some older clients have been injured , particularly in the middle of a payment system .
some vinyl fans can be knocked off your feet the digital world and selected confidence of familiar album cover persistence ; objects , which evoke the teenage happy days memories .
” i think that sometimes there may be a case of opening fulfillment or some kind of comfort , which the object of ownership , ” wez said .
myself a collector , i admit that this is true , and i believe it to be true for many people .
it is an easy way to fill the thoughts .
” we &apos;re like their social worker , their ! ” another employee said suddenly and the disc stack .
april icm conducted a public opinion poll revealed that almost 50 % of the people who had bought vinyl in the last month , had not yet listened to it .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player , which they never use , while 7 % of the vinyl buying on is not a record player .
this is where the news reports are likely to show serious worried navigating through the bossa nova collection of a stack .
this revival of ” the prize ” -perspective is something , which also sounds of the universe ( counter : three middle-aged men ) working jonny , 42 , has been noticed .
” someone came a little while ago in and said : ’ i don &apos;t have a record player , but i want to buy a radiohead album , so we can put it on the shelf , ’ ” he said .
this is not a high percentage , but it definitely happened .
more product , less music .
we have people who say : ” i don &apos;t have a record player . ”
not so older , but younger people , late teens , who are just excited about things .
fopp , which today is almost a whole floor reserved for vinyl , is when i arrived a much more diverse audience .
seven year old couples , tourists taking photos , a teenage girl and a middle-aged woman .
although the atmosphere is less casual than the previously mentioned establishments - the speakers resounding the wild beast &apos;s latest synth - and sex-fueled pop , and improvisational jazz - it &apos;s great to see a variety of clients .
none of them seem particularly lonely , but the gnawing psychological trauma is difficult to prove by standing next to someone for 30 seconds .
elanora , 27 , has been walking around in fopp for a few minutes looking at the sale of the various discs .
she is doing window shopping , not spending a lot of money .
he told me , you don &apos;t make much money , so the disk collection is not really an option .
” it is expensive .
it is easy to listen to music either on my computer or something else through , but the vinyl beauty is ... ” he sighs lovingly .
” i don &apos;t know how to explain - it &apos;s really unique . ”
the last stop in my place to say vexed new vinyl lovers generation : urban outfitters .
at the same time , when you try , it seems that the study of denim shorts , the observation of teenage girls &apos; groups , which accumulate for a while polaroid cameras around , before father and daughter reflect on crosleyn turntable to buy .
on the left is a staircase , which wall is adele , jeff buckley , amy winehouse and fleetwood mac album covered : a mix of contemporary music and classics , which any average collection of essential disks .
no one look at them - perhaps because they are just decorations , and some are so high that they touched would be impossible .
this is purely ” art vinyl ” .
but when you take into account that these objects receive little attention can mean more money for the industry and send a few customers in the soho depths of the get more , this is not much to complain about .
not come as a surprise , that it population , which is more likely more time and money , it is also , which uses the most luxury objects , such as vinyl .
but although these findings suggest that yougov &apos;s results are accurate , at least in the soho record store , they do not rule out that female collectors and vinyl lovers in large quantities , which exists in the real world , record stores and online forums .
these people most likely work hard in school or in the office .
they don &apos;t really spend a thursday morning i sit there by around berwick street &apos;s record store , browse the discs and avoiding the creepy 30-year-old television host , looking for this peek at the unsuspecting middle-aged men over the shoulders .

where is everybody ?
rio athletics stadium ring exceedingly hollow
where is everyone ?
at least not the rio olympic stadium athletics track .
rio was started friday , the struggling athletics medals , but the world &apos;s top individuals were allowed to showcase their skills confusing to an empty audience .
rio is organized by told me on friday that only 58 % of the first day of aamukisa of tickets and 65 percent in the race for the tickets has been sold .
the second was four years ago in london , where the stadium flexing cheered until people .
the finale of the tickets are riossakin already sold out .
the rio olympic games katsojakato has attracted attention even before athletics .
for example , rugby , paddling and riding in the stands has been reflected in the thousands of empty seats .
when brazil &apos;s medal hopes talita antunes and larissa franca played beach volleyball at the legendary copacabana , was in the stands only 70 % full .
brazilian duo after the dutch played against russia , and 12 000 people in the stands were filled with only about 30 % .
bad yardage to explain at least the fact that financial difficulties in a struggling brazil is far from the european and asian races of tourists , and many of the olympic sports are strange to football get used fashioned brazilians .
though even the brazilian football team &apos;s first match couldn &apos;t pull the foot ball stadium full .
the organizers of the spokesman mario andrada told reporters the weekend , the ticket was sold at the time of 82 % , which is clearly a smaller number than four years ago .
&quot; there are still 1.1 million end of sale &quot; , andrada said to reuters .
london olympic games 8.5 million ticket was sold 8.2 million , although the box publishing for almost half of the more than rio .
in rio ticket prices are ranged from about nine million in the opening ceremony of the more than one thousand euros .
more than half of the ticket paid less than 16 euros .
london olympics volunteers and army personnel were allowed to sit on an empty place , but in rio this is still not allowed because the organizers need the money and are trying to get the tickets sold until the last moment .
rio organizers have however given 240 000 tickets to school children in the country for less known species , such as golf and rugby .
the rio stadium was enough in the morning empty seats .
even beach volleyball copacabana in the sand is not interested in the audience .
jukka keskisalo competed in london 2012 .
the crowd in the gallery was enough .

bike thieves are tormented by the great cities of the evil of turku - see home on your situation
bicycle thieves tormented by finland &apos;s largest cities the worst of turku .
there has this year stolen number of inhabitants in proportion to more bikes than the nine other largest cities .
helsingin sanomat , explained the police reported bike thefts on the basis of any degree in the ten largest cities is in this year january-august , stolen bicycles and their parts thousand per capita .
turku in addition to the tip of the rose helsinki , oulu and lahti .
they happened the police according to the information of four to five bike thefts per thousand inhabitants .
instead , espoo and kouvola police was informed only about two bike thefts per thousand inhabitants .
after all , it &apos;s a big difference .
&quot; others in the cities the number of inhabitants in proportion to double the number of thefts compared to the other &quot; , characterizes the police the government police inspector tom sleigh .
turku police wonder why the city has a comparison of the top spot .
it is extremely difficult to say , why turku is stolen more bikes than the rest .
i don &apos;t have an answer for that .
&quot; the theft frequency can affect it , how much of the city in moving the wheels and how much on the wheel at all &quot; , says sergeant teemu Äikäs .
police government tommi reen considered quite expected , turku , helsinki and oulu will rise in comparison to the tip .
bicycle theft the number went largely according to what you are studying and cycling in the city .
turku is close to downtown , short distances and a lot of bike on offer to the thieves .
&quot; for example , espoo has , in turn , different kind of city , where the city centers are far apart and the bike is not necessarily the primary movement tool &quot; , reen said .
in finland the police is in january-august become a little less bike theft than last year the corresponding period .
the great joy is not a still subject .
last year , the downward trend in spite of the police becomes a little bit more than 20 000 bike thefts every year .
that means 50-60 bike every day and only in helsinki for about 4 000 bikes a year .
&quot; those are big number , &quot; sleigh said .
in reality , the thieves are taking more of a wheel , because only a part of the victims report the theft to the police .
reen urged the people to make police report bike theft , even though fewer than one in ten police reported the incident to find out .
a typical cleared bike theft is the kind where the police get the information of the theft immediately , and the thief caught red-handed .
&quot; cases also other investigations in connection with , for example , when a drug deal in the apartment to find the stolen bike , &quot; reen says .
helsinki bike thieves get caught on a weekly basis in the act or the police investigation in the context , says a senior officer timo alder hill .
according to him , the bike is stolen , for example , shopping centres , bike rack , courtyard , storage and bike in the basement , i.e. practically everywhere where they are normally stored .
individual bike models most stolen in previous years , a huffy .
u-locks give the bike better protection than many other types of locks .
some thieves will take the wheel for example , the short-term for their own use , but a large part of the stolen bikes end up for sale for example , the internet .
they remain in the domestic market .
&quot; at least the police has not been informed that the stolen bike would go very little abroad , &quot; reen said .
stolen bike buyers are police , according to the ordinary finns .
part of the buy a probably stolen bike unknowingly .
part of it may be the fact doubts .
used bike buyer should be careful , because he may be guilty of concealment or misconduct .
&quot; alarm bells should be ringing , if in good condition the bike is sold out below cost &quot; , reen said .
specialist library clerk severi deer bear colorful o its always working for cliff-the library of helsinki .
the bike he &apos;s had five pieces , but none have stolen , moose told me . &quot; there &apos;s never been exported , has so far been a good monk . &quot;
&quot; perhaps this is not so much unattractive to thieves , this is not necessarily the hipster value of a &quot; , a helsinki stag to consider .
helsinki located in the kiosk in urgent shopped siiri valve locked my bicycle to a small u-lock .
now the bike sat a little kiosk against the wall , but usually the valve will lock the bike to something immovable , like a bike rack .
&quot; will think about things a lot , because this bike is the most expensive thing i owned &quot; , helsinki student said on the white bike , whose frame alone costs around five hundred euros .
&quot; the whole time i heard from a friend that the bike is stolen . &quot;
&quot; mostly bad bike , the kind of rattletrap-a huffy &quot; .
valveelta itself was stolen from the bike house the company &apos;s courtyard a year ago .
bike though had been left unlocked , so the valve can expect it to usurp .
under the 15-year-olds responsible for the crimes committed ?

other consequences may be , for example , the family a written letter explaining what &apos;s done and what &apos;s been learned .
youth action director tommi time of tell , that the model is not strict .
we have other mediation models , which are used in parallel .
&quot; in all controlled youth activities more responsible in the direction of so that everything is not going to be ruined the first error &quot; , the time of tell .
the peer jury crew is taken from the model in the united states , where it is widely used .
the idea is that young is not the first crime after being subjected to the adult the front of the panel but reflect on what happened about the same age .
the model has been tried on once .
try to follow the service design office palm service design for all and sundry lovio told me that this was assault , which was carried out successfully .
especially under the 15 years of the first crime may not have before been addressed .
&quot; it &apos;s been the message that to continue in your chosen path &quot; , lovio said .

such are the rio ratings : games are not sticking finns front of the tv sets , but mobile app interest
usually sports games appear on television viewers statistics in the sharp mountain peaks .
the rio olympic games have so far not been able to reach huge audiences .
at the time of the race you are sticking the tile edge at best 12 % of the population : the tuesday-night swimming followed yle &apos;s olympic channel tv2 at the same time 615 000 spectators .
for comparison : a month ago , european championships in athletics were tv2 &apos;s desk at a time almost 800 000 spectators , and the football championship fair and square the second million .
olympic sport of the most is so far interested in the sunday-night cycling and the fifth race of the afternoon opened the artistic gymnastics , both of which target the olympic channel at a time nearly half a million viewers .
yle sports chief panu pokkinen is satisfied with the ratings , and recalls that viewers divide into the rio olympics for the first time on several different instruments .
television in addition to finnish the next olympics in rio arena .
we are pleased to see how much of tv-watching in general selects the olympics .
television have viewers divided between tv2 and yle fem channel .
the rio olympics are the first sports championships , for which yle has dedicated an entire channel .
when the broadcast comes 24 hours a day , and viewers is the entire time from 20 000 to 500 000 , so it is a good base .
viewership are lower than in the 2012 london championships or the 2008 beijing games , but the difference is partly explained by the difference in time - a large part of the rio race broadcasts will come to finland in the night-time .
another reason for the weak interest - if you now someone weak keep - it is certainly a traditional finnish reason : if finland would have taken the start of the race someone to a surprise medal , the interest would bounce upwards with it .
in addition , universal sports is just beginning , as well as other finnish interest types : sailing and horse riding .
the beginning of viewership have been pokkinen , close to the expected .
when the athletics start , the ratings will explode .
yle launched its race for yle rio 2016 -a mobile app that rose to the race of the first days of the apple app store in finland ladatuinta for free application .
by monday , the app had been downloaded 150 000 times .
i guess that now goes for 200 000 downloads of around .
&quot; network ratings we get later &quot; . , pokkinen tell
rio arena has not worked for all users properly .
pokkinen said that the feedback has become and the faults can be repaired .
rio arena use has been associated with delay and other minor technical problems in the early stages .
applications have been received the updated version , which should fix the errors .
the rio olympics views on yle &apos;s channels and arena wider than any other sporting event ever .
yle fem channel can follow some of the species , and radio in yle speech to convey to the races on a daily basis .
the olympic games are not only perhaps the most laborious yle for ever , also the last , which can only follow yle &apos;s channels .
beginning in 2018 , olympic sports shows as well as the finnish broadcasting company yle and commercial channels .

music event alongside can be trendy young adults from the community .
the event is not , however , consciously profiled itself particularly fashionable .
we want to stand out above all the content .
still , also the fashion phenomena of the fit flow &apos;s value world : curiosity and the desire to interact with the environment , says cliff .
this year , one of the main stage artists is a punk legend , the 69-year-old iggy pop .

rock , iggy book , because now is probably the last time this see you at the gig in finland .
we &apos;re interested in all history and the future .

cruise ship bartender in 1995 , the tango king of finland &apos;s best selling been a solo artist , as well as dance on stage and festival of the star reach the beachhead keep going further and he is currently wildly in buoyancy .
mari koppinen written by your favorite singer &apos;s life book jari sillanpää - bare was published today , thursday .

1995 in the spring of jukka kuoppamäki was composed by beachhead to the man at the request of the tango song , by kassu halonen agreed on a slightly different format .
fairy tale castle-the song became one of the finnish music history &apos;s most popular song .
in the book that track record does not , however , gone quite according to plan : the sills sing it on tape a terrible hangover and only a couple of hours of sleep a night .
we had been the evening of the party .
i was so hungover !
sills recalls in the book .
intensive would hit up the track of the recording did not immediately guess that it is sung with a hangover .
even though i wasn &apos;t physically at my best , the secondary was still good .
i learned that the entire period does not have to require himself the perfect and top .
another man of some of the most popular songs associated with the incident , which in the book takes place almost twenty years later .
in 2013 , the beachhead resigned from the then partner of his and the case ended up in the end also you deserve a gold -song texts , which was published in the uk in 2014 .
in the book that sarah törmäseltä the ordered words of the song weren &apos;t as beachhead would have wanted .
beachhead had thought she was doing the disc , which tells the true story of his own life , but the difference of the song , the words weren &apos;t true , but it was written in 7 days-the journal news basis .
the journal news in jari &apos;s and my ex-beloved a difference the reason i was given was jari &apos;s excessive partying and alcohol use , but the jar said it was bullshit and not true .
jari calling according to the book outraged the record company and refused to sing songs , but eventually ended up , however , to sing it and so far so good .
in june , the british surprised himself by voting for his kingdom out of the eu .
in the end , 52 % of voters in favour of difference and 48 % had remained in the union , although the vote of the week polls to usher in were reversed print .
british economists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in the eu , stay in the position .
none of the prestigious research institute or university is not flagged by the difference in favour , although a few individual scientists dare to disagree with the profession into the mainstream .
western policy , the basic mantra , the usa former president bill clinton &apos;s recent election campaign theme , the phrase &quot; it &apos;s the economy , stupid &quot; flying dustbin british brexit vote .
economists were shocked when their voice could not be heard .
they were shocked , when the economy does not have to be a policy priority .
economic kiharakin from
the centre for macroeconomics said in its latest monthly survey in the profession from the answers to brexit-a disaster .
the typical answer is that economists listen , because this time the voters make a decision on other than economic grounds .
one of the economists explanation of the economic status of the loss is that people don &apos;t understand the economy .
many still have the illusion that the number of jobs is independent of a , almost a standard .
if an immigrant gets a job , it &apos;s a right british out .
many also have the perception that the currency value would be a good thing , because it contributes to the export industry .
the economist on the mind of voters do not believe the economic arguments , because the economist consensus does not become sufficiently raised .
they niggle , especially the bbc &apos;s neutrality , which gave as much space to only a few percent of the economists on the representative eu-the difference between a profitable economic scientists than the overwhelming majority .
eu-hostile press is not interested in tell me what you think of ifs , ifm , boe , cepr and lse and other economic power in the combination of letters in the difference the consequences are .
those distant combination of letters you were talking about the faceless have economic growth , trade relations , state debt and currency .
and if the economist of messages as well as listen to the most that was understood , so they do not care , because economists represent the kind of elite , with whom the voters not in his own mind have common interests .
economists such as metropolitan academic would be yes remained in the eu , but in small towns and rural areas the message didn &apos;t work .
migration is the economy
brexit vote by far won the argument on immigration .
an immigrant takes your job , immigrant congestion in the hospital glass , the immigrant taking advantage of you .
these arguments will do the trick .
every cafe is foreign workers .
how many more jobs the british would be if they would go away ?
each health center in the waiting room sees the immigrants .
how much easier to the british , did not see a doctor , if they hadn &apos;t ?
each school has immigrants children .
how much more easily the right of the british kids would get beat up in school , if you get rid of them ?
in every municipality inhabited by foreigners .
how much more space the natives would , if they could go away ?
i think these are economic issues .
they relate to jobs , housing and public services .
economists do not , however , managed to answer them and if you were successful , their response did not receive the visibility .
economists failed to explain that the immigrants thanks to the british have more jobs , fewer health center queues , and more money for education and social security .
immigrants - and especially eu-migrants - are britain &apos;s public finances , the net pay and their consumption generates jobs .
aberdeen real estate fund prepared brexit in cash
one of the fund were aberdeen asset management , whose investments in real estate equivalent to the finnish pertti vanhanen .
according to him , in aberdeen , was prepared in time brexit was produced by a - and b-plans .
plan b , i.e. the eu-the difference between a profitable camp victory began to be prepared in more detail a few weeks before the vote , in case that the result would leave .
the concern was that investors would start to pull their funds out of the market .
real estate funds do not normally have substantial liquid assets , but now they could be necessary .
we left to raise cash .
when brexit happened 23. day , we had 25 % of the fund &apos;s investments in cash or liquid assets , vanhanen said aberdeen &apos;s only open daily quoted portfolio real estate fund , which the news relates .
vanhanen , the normal level should be 15-20 % .
the value of the fund at that time was 3.5 billion pounds .
total company funds worth about 20 billion pounds .
it was a high of number nine in the open real estate funds , vanhanen said of all the british real estate funds open real estate funds .
he estimated that the lowest cash quantity of these funds missed the top ten percent or even less .
real estate fund so you &apos;re prepared for the brexit was very different strategies .
funds to close the trade
when the eu-the difference between a profitable camp victory , europe went nuts .
the real estate market the vote followed nearly two weeks , however , were quite calm , vanhanen told reporters .
then two things happened that changed the situation .
the first was bank of england governor mark carney &apos;s speech , in which he estimated that the brexit could be commercial property work which is a big risk .
in addition , real estate funds , the first , standard life , froze trading .
these , together with the ryöpäyttivät the situation and raise the issue of the financial times and the bbc pääotsikoihin .
the situation was compared in 2007 and 2008 , vanhanen said .
this made investors nervous .
institutional investors remained more calm , but private investors are getting nervous .
the snow ball starts to roll , and fund after another was forced to close its doors .
the aberdeen situation was a good the collected cash , but that too was ultimately forced to freeze trading six days .
vanhanen says that they do not actually closed the trade , but changed their pricing down .
in practice , investors were given according to him , time to consider , is it worth the money right now to pull out of the panic .
aberdeen &apos;s message was that if you don &apos;t have to take your money out , it &apos;s not worth it , because it would cause losses .
it calms the situation , and most of the withdrawal notification .
after been quite steady , and now the market has been in a couple of weeks of very calm , vanhanen told reporters .
he pointed out that , for example , the aberdeen continental europe fund does not have any similar turmoil .
queries , however , a lot of .
unreasonably the attention of real estate funds
vanhanen believes that the real estate fund of the trade of the road closures were disproportionately much attention .
open funds , which closures regarding , dominated by around four per cent of the british real estate .
aberdeen &apos;s barrier lasted six days , and the company sold out in less than ten property of 80 in london , located on the property .
some other funds are still closed .
aviva investors warned investors this week that it may have to fund their catch up in 2017 to the side .
currently there is uncertainty , and economic growth forecasts have set been down , but the situation does not look like aberdeen in terms of &quot; more and more outrageous &quot; .
the biggest issues concern now the british economy &apos;s future development .
despite this uncertainty , the situation has brought for a part of the real estate investors up to new opportunities , vanhanen points out .
sterling and dollar exchange rate is at its lowest level in 30 years , in addition to which the market is 15 % discount sale brexit vote in the preceding period .
the dollar buyer can now buy the same property up to 30 % cheaper .
willing buyers is much , vanhanen said .
brexit other minuses in the london real estate market
at two in the morning the situation did not seem to still very much .
but at four o &apos;clock , when the british real estate fund aberdeen asset management responsible for real estate investments pertti vanhanen woke up again to watch the brexit referendum results , the situation was different .
power words that get .
i realized that this will now go to plan b : no side , vanhanen said in the second home in helsinki .
he headed immediately to work .
the city of london was already fully alive in the morning .
at the office normally silent as provided for by the tv screen through the news , and the usual noisy crowd went quiet fully listen to , when prime minister david cameron stepped in this morning in front of the camera to tell the difference .
when the market opened , the screens were flashing pure red .
it was the kind of morning that would not have ever believed in his life , vanhanen said .
not because of any of that despite the turmoil in aberdeen , one of the uk &apos;s largest property funds , finishing brexit vote the day after , i.e. in midsummer , the two real estate trade .
the atmosphere was confusing .
the company , however , was prepared for the alternative , very , and therefore , the situation was kind of calm , vanhanen told reporters .
brexit-the voting started correction
the vote followed a storm .
the pound tumbled , britain &apos;s leaders went to the exchange .
the market began to anticipate the drastic decline of the british and especially the london property market .
london office spaces anticipated up to 20 % of minuses in the coming years .
soon , the british real estate funds began to freeze trading one after another .
aberdeen did so for six days .
now the storm has subsided , but the air is winning still uncertainty .
not that it looks the last summer vacation day of this week in helsinki , spent the hours on the face .
in his opinion , is still far too early to say much about what brexit from the company .
so much is still open : how divorce happens and how scotland will respond to the situation around , for example .
the london real estate market development has already obtained the first information .
real estate services company cbre &apos;s data on price developments cover about a third of the market .
according to them , all london real estate prices fell 3.3 per cent from june to july .
the city of london office buildings minus the accumulated 6.1 % , vanhanen lists .
the figures are not so terrible , but they are monthly changes .
the monthly index was launched in 1987 , and only five months had worse figures , vanhanen said .
all just as large drops hit the crisis years of 2007 and 2008 .
it is interesting , therefore , that the brexit to compared quite quickly lehman &apos;s downfall and the us real estate market to the global economic crisis .
vanhanen &apos;s view , the analogy is not quite apt , because now it is the uk &apos;s homespun crisis .
the atmosphere is another .
the property market is not now see that time , like panic selling , but the willingness to sell in order to improve liquidity , vanhanen said .
funding to find normally .
correction could have been in front in any case
in fact , the price of the repair business is not for him a miracle - such a thing could be in front without brexitiäkin .
aberdeen estimates that london and other of the world &apos;s top urban real estate prices have for years been too high .
we have said for two years that the city and especially the offices are overpriced , vanhanen said .
the drop , therefore , starts really high .
london prices have gained upwards of four reasons , vanhanen list .
the british economy has grown strongly , the population of london as well .
another big trend is that real estate is the last of the ownership class , which globalisation , vanhanen said .
the middle east and asia has become the market of new operators , and a growing number of institutions and private investors seek real estate investment targets abroad .
london is famous city as a easy target .
in addition to the price of fed low interest rates , which is why , for example , the pension companies have had to seek income in new locations .
on top of this loan has been readily available , although financial leverage is used by vanhanen , is now clearly less than in the 2008 pre-crisis boom period .
distributed please , spread please
in london prices-leveled last summer , vanhanen told reporters .
aberdeen started to lighten their holdings in london , and was , indeed , last year a net seller .
expected was some kind of turning point , and now it came .
what this forward ?
it depends on how the uk economy develops , vanhanen said .
much he does not dare to be the judge , but said that any increase in the spikes is hardly the permit .
the atmosphere suggests that there is a declining or flat rate .
vanhanen has seen a number of movements up and down , as he has been in real estate since 1988 .
and still , he is optimistic , that believes that pit get out of work .
if you are prepared for the risks well , is in a better position .
he believes in global diversification .
if you have invested in one market , it is too much a victim of it .
if it is fragmented , risk is also distributed , vanhanen said .

earlier the same day to play the semifinals of the tough 7-5 victory over south africa might bother them in the finals .
but despite this , the fidi would be in this condition won even if 15 people on god &apos;s team .
great britain could maybe - but probably not - take comfort in the fact that at least one britillä is tomorrow a gold medal around his neck : fidin head coach ben ryan , england &apos;s former boss wimbledon .
britain &apos;s journey has been quite .
eight years ago they ryan &apos;s coaching by lost every game of the adelaide tournament .

great britain made a break had tons of changes that clog the fidin the dam ... a whole four minutes , which in the first half in comparison with the time was well until josue tuisova scored fidin to influence the input after the game .
dan norton grabbed the great britain goal in making the touchdown in the left corner and narrowing down the situation numbers 36-7 , but the game had long been lost in the south sea islanders , whose supporters sang , waved flags and danced in the stands .
it was difficult not to admire without fidin joyous approach .
mata viliam last minute times when it was the icing on fidin cake , not the icing didn &apos;t need to .
whistle was fidiläiset hugged and britain fell to the grass , completely beaten .
earlier the same day in fidi was beaten japan in the semi-final 20-5 , and great britain beat south africa in a tight in the semi-final , where both scored one goal britain &apos;s goal-kick settled the game .
kyle brown took south africa into the lead in the first half , but dan norton crossed the finish area to a stunning foot work and scored the goal post less than in the second half .

the coach &apos;s fight against cancer inspired helen glover and heather stan ning rowing you can toon
these games is not going to be feeling a lot of hysteria-inducing gold , and it really means something .
from the first stroke to the last , 220 hard kiskaisua towards the history books , helen glover and heather stannington find the golden moments of their estacio da lagoa have a deeper meaning .
even if they are rowing together , the boat had three votes . coach robin williams , the echo was present all the time , when the duo sped to a second consecutive olympic gold medal in their women &apos;s pair competition - the first woman in british sport in the history books , able to reach such achievement .
their control was perfect , and this was their 39. appearance in the undefeated , which is a record .
this , what we see , two great athletes gliding on the surface of the swan sulokkuudella , not completely a picture of the winning character .
each rowing gold in the background is a group of helpful pair of hands , which will contribute gradually to those things that matter . and not one pair of hands was less essential than the coach , which is 30 months ago , a cancer diagnosis after getting to know , would he to this day .
as he said , the situation was a close call .
i had bladder cancer , which is one cut available things , and they performed the surgery .
if they don &apos;t cut , it will spread everywhere .
the situation could have been pretty bad .
it will change a little bit your way of thinking .
williams got the diagnosis in december 2013 .
the trio was lucky in that his treatment was able to start at the beginning of 2014 through to the outside , when they caused the least possible disturbance - if that term can ever use in such situations .
i need to get paid , so i need to heal quickly .
it encouraged me .
i was in the hospital and i walked around the department - 20 , 30 , 50 feet at a time , when they said that a few steps would be enough .
so it begins .
rowing itself is a journey , but it makes it a little bigger .
immediately after the victory on the first couple of thoughts were williams , who had been nervous in the morning , and he had spoken a little more than usual trying to deal with their own nerves stu .
stannington , the afghan commander , an experienced captain in the royal artillery regiment , said : ” i &apos;ve been emotional wreck this week , which can perhaps be a little overreaction , but this means so much to me . ”
it just underlines how important this is to me , how hard me and helen , and robin also , we have worked with .
worn for three years helen and robin have been great .
without robin we would be nothing , so for him to hear thank you very much , he is the world &apos;s best coach .
i couldn &apos;t imagine a better training partner or a better coach .
helen glover and heather stannington are not lost to the competition in five years .
the couple set up a rough rhythm , which their competitors do not reach .
yet in the last 500 metres , while new zealand and denmark teams began to approach , stanningilla and gloverilla was too much energy in stock .
we were very caught up in the moment .
helen shouted ” stay in the process , stay in the process ” .
it is really important to keep it under control .
we had a good start , and we &apos;re not at the same time tried to do anything special .
we searched tonight fireworks , we strive only for good rowing and to win a race , and so we did .
a couple wait a year , before you decide on their future .
glover will participate in next month &apos;s wedding , when she marries tv adventurer steve backshall .
right now he just wants to enjoy the moment .
” i didn &apos;t want to say that this would be the last competition my .
that would put too much pressure .
after london took about six months to realize that i was the olympic champion .
it was all so new and i was so stressed out .
here it takes about four minutes .
this feels so much better , ” he said .

the tidal wave of the past - the people &apos;s news
the sea &apos;s churning fatally , but the actual tsunami strikes in the middle of the madrid street scene - a reckoning with the past can begin .
in summary pedro almodóvarin the novelty of the story &apos;s core .
almodovar &apos;s previous directing work travel lovers ( 2013 ) had a little fun and brisk-hand satirical comedy , it pre-the skin i live in ( 2011 ) spanish virtuoso career peaks .
level dinner with julie ( 2016 ) is ranked somewhere in those two works .
it is agreed the woman serene love , relationship and family drama that focuses on mother and daughter relationship .
the story is simple and seen very much as a long flashback .
life seems to be a model at the middle-aged title character ( emma suarez ) , but then it all threatens to fall apart .
random encounters in the aftermath of the new man-friend ( dario grandinetti ) is allowed to be stumped whenever the movie towards the end .
flashbacks and a long letter in the form of julie times life stages adult growth and successful daughter .
he started to the time before the daughter &apos;s birth , the moment when the met this coming father &apos;s ( daniel grao ) .
at the same time another female lead to rising julietaa as a young teacher the adrain to ugarte , the tv familiar series of suture between the time ( 2013-2014 ) .
manage to bone me julie aging is treated in a manner which can keep the kökkönä , but in fact i would say that kind of funny and words in accordance with a single sweeping .
almodóvar film to often so characteristic of räiskyvyyttä always humor right down to manage to bone me julie is a fair distance .
it is strong acting , low-key , some good music and quite a melancholy film , in which a is ingredients elegiaan .
instead , the spanish pilot &apos;s typical visual color saturation is still there and thus , that it starts to inject a little quiet for anything more , clean as a matter of form than as a drama of power as a means .
movie persons afflicted by diseases , deaths or otherwise , just a sudden loss , but the surface remains as fair .
this is especially true of the costumes : the name of the person in case you live in change the scene to another , and the same applies to the theatrical earrings .
almodóvar is these matters closely , but the main thing i.e. your current scene setup is not this much better .
mechanical when repeated impression is external and a bit uninspired .
almodóvar has made a script of the nobel prize for literature in 2013 , the award-winning canadian alice munro three a short story based on it .
short stories have been published in the book runaway : stories .
almodóvar has invested in dialog , the result is a somewhat uniform thickness in the written literature of the remake of the road .
the ingredients would have been emotionally incomparably jykevämpään more drama , some big things - especially the nagging guilt movie themes handles .
directing and screenplay : pedro almodóvar .
based on alice munro &apos;s three short stories .
starring : emma suarez , adriana ugarte , rossy de palma , daniel grao , dario grandinetti .
the movie premiere is 12.8 .

now it is not endured , but more than half of the party voters had enough of the government policy already during the first year .
the first character is also the party &apos;s parliamentary group käymistilasta have come to the surface .
the new cuts should not be-rhetoric first obfuscate the fact that the next year they made them drastically and secondly , trying to soften the true finns pending attack .
suurleikkaukset in 2018 ?

the municipality elections after a government has two options .

it means more on the new even harsher cuts in the year 2017 budget barn .

unemployment is at decade increased by 35 % and prolonged an average of 34 to 54 weeks .
unemployment now costs three billion euros per year more than in 2008 .
hetemäki presented curve of government debt , which exceeded the 60 % threshold in 2014 , will rise in the next decade in the mid-70 % .
what is responsible ?
in the spring of 2015 left alliance presented by the debt recovery was rejected because it was considered irresponsible .
the first year of unemployment , the maintenance will cost about six billion euros , which will cover virtually all new debt by taking .
this is the center , the coalition party and the true finns idea of what is responsible .
survey : the committee is to leave a lot of tasks
three out of four considers that children in day care , youth work and sports organisation of the municipality &apos;s responsibility , it turns out two - municipal development research .
a clear majority of the people from the scroll the responsibility of the individual municipalities including libraries , culture , adult education , construction supervision , high school education , as well as waste management .
provincial responsibility in turn is to be clearly provincial planning , special medical care , vocational training , polytechnics and developmental disabilities institutional care .

snapchatin ” anime ” -effects reviews on asian karikatyyriksi
snapchatin according to the anime , has acted as a source of inspiration for the filter , but some observers say it is racist .
lens tool with the help of their snapchat allows approximately 150 million daily user of reality editing , and identity play in ways that are almost ridiculous .
you can change yourself ananakseksi , a dog or a character that fits a roy liechtenstein painting .
the lenses are simple , the facial features väänteleviä tools , which produce more than 30 million improved selfie of the day .
all illusion-step up quickly to public documents .
snapchatin lenses has previously criticized the charges , that the application to advertise the blackface - i.e. ” black face ” -a mask or favors bleached complexion beauty as an ideal .
so when snapchat ad in this week for some users the lens , which gives them slanted eyes , crooked teeth and chubby cheeks , some critics called it racist karikatyyriksi asian people ” yellow-face ” , i.e. yellowfaceksi .
and they wonder , could these repeated polemiikit be a sign of the company &apos;s biggest problem regarding diversity .
news and outcry spread wide on wednesday , the verge and mother board &apos;s reports , days later , snapchat said to wind that he had feature .
the company offers an explanation : the lens was meant as a tribute to the anime characters , not karikatyyriksi asians .
but the racism experienced observers of the lens was a reminder of the offensive stereotypes in action .
others banned the anime in comparison vehemently .
grace sparapani , a korean-american art student , which tweets photographs circulated widely , said the email that the lens was &quot; the least offensive and uncomfortable ” .
he added that ” it is difficult to argue against the comparison , which are adjacent to each other outrageous asian caricature and filter effects ” .
it shows that the filter is not only yellow , but the yellow face taken to the extreme of degrading a new one .
snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural trip wires .
american culture seems to be caught in the endless struggle with diversity and inclusion , corporations boardroom to hollywood and devices , where all we carry in our hands .
and snapchatin a huge , racially parents diverse young audience can mean that they &apos;re even more likely to expect to understand the attitude .
25-year-old katie zhu said in an interview thursday that when one snapchatin lenses create the user from the infringing image , ” for these guys is much more difficult to be inconspicuous ” .
on thursday , zhu , mediumille working with the product manager and engineer , i decided to remove snapchat account and urge others to do the same .
essay in mediumille and a telephone interview he said he believes that race-related disputes reflect snapchatin hiring practices , diversity , deprivation .
zhu reviews the company mainly white , male-led , and decided to his essay on the hashtag # delete snapchat ( # delete snapchat )
” either they don &apos;t have a person in my diversity of different skin color representation , which is why they are capable of making this kind of decision ” , a chinese-american zhu said , ” or they have a different skin color with the representatives of the work , but they are not in a position where they would feel safe or be able to talk directly . ”
other observers share his opinion , the complaint , which snapchat has left largely unanswered .
the company does not make public figures on staff diversity , pointing out its status as a private company .
thursday , snapchat refused to discuss staff racial backgrounds , but a representative , according to the company hired some time ago a recruiter to focus on aliedustettuihin population and to push forward the internal integration efforts .
for their part , zhu said that to keep snapchat accounts will be closed , adding : ” do you think so , that they in fact need more people like us users to be able to say that this is not ok . ”
the congressional panel , according to military officials distorted the isis intelligence
on thursday a report published in the congressional panel said the authority of the united states armed forces in the war zone to the headquarters of the editing of intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the iraq and syria war isis against , than what the facts on the ground justified .
the house of representatives armed forces committee of the republican president , the intelligence committee and defense appropriations subcommittee of the task force established by the interim report found ” widespread dissatisfaction ” headquarters intelligence analysts among them , who said that supervisors tampered with their assessments of american efforts to defeat isis .
the headquarters , known as centcom , is one the armed forces of the war zone headquarters florida in tampa , which oversees u.s. military operations in the middle east and central asia .
” high-value more centcom &apos;s leaders approved by the intelligence outputs typically gave us counter-terrorism efforts to a more positive image than what the place on the facts justified . they were systematically more positive than the intelligence community other factors produce analyses ” , reports the press release said .
” centcom &apos;s events are unacceptable - our fighters in the war suffer , when bad analyses presented to high-ranking decision-makers ” , representative ken calvert , a california republican , said .
centcom &apos;s leadership failures reaching right to the organization to the top .
ten page report describes in detail the constant problems of the headquarters of the descriptions and analysis in the u.s. efforts to train iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015 .
although it does not give a clear evidence that the obama administration &apos;s highest-ranking administrative authorities had ordered a report on the tampering , it describes the analysts feel , like centcom &apos;s leaders would put them under pressure to describe the islamic state , isis , the threat posed by a more positive light .
” in 2015 , the entire first half-time , many headquarters press releases , statements and certificates in congress were considerably more positive than the events themselves ” , the report said .
centcom &apos;s authority , for example , the statement publicly that a major offensive on mosul to retake the can be started even as early as april or may 2015 .
mosul , iraq &apos;s second largest city , is still in isis &apos;s possession .
” after months of investigation after this is very clear , ” representative mike pompeo , a kansas republican , said in the statement .
mid-2014 to mid-2015 of united states armed forces in the war zone , the headquarters of the high value of the intelligence leaders were manipulated by the headquarters of the intelligence outputs mitigate the isis threat in iraq .
the republicans created the task force after hearing that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence information about islamic state was manipulated .
thursday as a published report to follow the more extensive results of the investigation in progress .
the defense department inspector general has begun an additional , ongoing investigation of centcom &apos;s intelligence .
the house of representatives intelligence committee democrat members announced thursday its findings that were consistent with some of the republican working group &apos;s final conclusions .
” between 2014 and 2015 centcom created isis and iraqi security forces intelligence ratings too isolated process , ” representative adam b. schiff , the committee &apos;s leading democrat , said in the statement .
schiff suggests that this process ” , a prolonged reconnaissance of the outputs to publish a ” reduced mood , according to analysts among and not ” give enough space to the divergent perspectives ” .
schiff and the democrats said that they did not find evidence that the white house was trying to put pressure on centcom &apos;s analysts to reconcile its conclusion on the ” pre-set or political narrative ” .
the daily beast reported tuesday , the congressional investigation of the preliminary results .
last august , the new york times reported that the pentagon &apos;s inspector general has launched an investigation into the centcom analyst of complaints after .
commander patrick evans , the pentagon representative , said in the statement that the ministry of defence does not comment on congressional report so long as the inspector general &apos;s investigation is ongoing .
but , he said , that ” the experts are in between disagree , complex information interpretation , and the intelligence community and the defense department keep a healthy dialogue on these essential national security topics welcome ” .
research has other repercussions , than just what comes to the question of whether the us-led bombing operations in iraq and syria successful ( such as the growing number of defence authorities are now claiming ) .
last year , accusations are questioning how much president obama can rely on headquarters to provide honest assessments of iraq , afghanistan , libya and other crisis areas , war action .
the islamic state &apos;s intelligence review reflects more than a decade ago , controversy , when centcom intelligence analyst , gregory hooker , wrote in a research article , which said that despite several analysts &apos; objections , president george w. bush &apos;s administration supported a small army in iraq and spent very little time wondering what the consequences of the 2003 invasion would be .
hooker had a key role also in the revolt from the islamic state of intelligence data .
according to the authorities , last year , hooker &apos;s group concluded that , despite to the contrary of public opinion , air strikes , islamic state controlled refineries were not significantly weakened the terrorist group in the economy , because it had built a makeshift refineries to sell oil on the black market .
the times reported in september that this discovery does not , however , been told the headquarters of the outside .
centcom &apos;s then-commander , general lloyd j. austin iii : tta , was criticised last year after many legislators keep his testimonies to the senate ylipositiivisen assessment of the war .
general austin retired in april , and his headquarters became general joseph l. votelta .
the united states won for the fourth time in a row the women &apos;s field hockey engineering a showdown with britain
the day after was done with three goals in the team &apos;s victory in the japanese 6-1 , katie bam did on thursday , the u.s. women &apos;s field hockey team the first two goals of the american victory in the indian 3-0 .
five goals in two games sounds forget matt &apos;s own achievement , but the 27-year-old bam said , i wasn &apos;t sure whether he had previously done the same .
” i have no idea , &quot; he said .
” i &apos;m actually not the kind of person who keeps track of his goals from . ”
but this she knows : the americans are 4-0 in the olympic tournament and they split the group in first place with britain , which was still unbeaten after winning on thursday the japanese 2-0 .
britain and the united states will face saturday in the first round in the last game .
both teams have survived to the quarter finals , and this game will determine who ranks first and who second in their six team group .
first place wins to avoid the strongest of the dutch , another group leader , a slightly longer quarter-finals .
matter how saturday &apos;s game ends , the americans have raised a stir with surprising success here , four years after they missed the london olympics final 12 team .
bam was on that team .
he grew up in pennsylvania blue bell and pick up a field hockey stick in his hands for the first time 3-year-old ( he &apos;s older twin sister were playing a species of drexel in ) related to national team at age 16 , when he became its all-time youngest player .
he was not included in the 2008 olympics , because didn &apos;t get the final player list .
in 2012 , nothing was going for him and his teammates .
the following year , englishman craig parnham was appointed as coach , and things began to change .
” culture change , mental change , physical change , ” bam said .
we don &apos;t in london had a similar pace of work as we have now .
we have done a u-turn .
thursday night , bam started the first-half scoring rystylyönnillä close to the goal .
india had come into the game in the air any win in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly hard and kept the situation 1-0-in the third installment of until the end , when bam took control of the situation .
he carried the ball to long field on the left wing , then circled around the middle and wrenched the ball into the goal taking the americans to a 2-0 lead .
melissa gonzalez added the final goal midway through the fourth period .
this zero game was the tournament &apos;s first u.s. goalkeeper jackie briggs , who had allowed one goal in each of the first three wins .
he is in good tune .
so is bam .
” we are now in a good situation , ” parnham said , but its goodness depends on saturday &apos;s game outcome .
trampoline of peace the olympics frenzy in the middle of the
wherever you are , whatever time it is , the olympics are running .
rio de janeiro events seem continual and inevitable , fierce competition and the efforts of the message .
and like the olympic torch would be a flaming baton , which is passed to the bowman swimmer and voimistelij under triathlonistille .
it is impossible to put on the television , read the newspaper or listen to the next conversation café &apos;s in the queue without that to hear simone biles , katie ledecky or michael phelps and chad le clos ’ between the european hostilities .
and then there are logan dooley .
dooley , olympic first timer , and a heartbreaker smile bumps , could very well be one of those all familiar names , which will be presented in prime time and which carry the sponsor agreement as well as the feel-good tv ads - if he was a swimmer , gymnast or even a swordsman .
but california lake forest from the dooley , 28 , competes for olympic gold on the trampoline .
the olympic flame is lit all the species as much .
the farther from the center , in partial shade , are those species , which all are generally accepted : air pistol shooting , archery , badminton , taekwondo .
we always have the breaststroke , long it long live .
but if i may make a moderate number of special favorite of mine , i would like to draw attention to the trampoline hillittyyn charm .
although the trampoline has been an olympic sport since 2000 , when it made its first appearance in the sydney olympics , its presence is between over the past 16 years the attention of so little , that many of the people i interviewed , didn &apos;t realize at all it was the olympics of the species .
this may be a regional ignorance .
although the united states has sent athletes to compete in the sport , it has never won that medal , and the athlete advanced to the finals before the year 2012 .
the chinese and the russians usually share the men , the chinese and the canadian women &apos;s medals .
this year , china &apos;s dong dong and canada &apos;s rosie mclennan defenders of london gold medals .
the trampoline was , however , associated with a certain underdog charm , partly because of the uncivilized ear it sounds better suited to clown school than the olympic games .
here i must confess that i &apos;m not an expert , i &apos;m just a flightless fan .
the species is a potential funny new , as we can see a cartoon film of the end of non-pomppujen vibe , but it also has the gymnastics and the diving grace , the two species , which it basically combines the .
the word ” trampoline ” comes from the spanish word el trampolín , which means springboard .
championship goal of the rookies are jumping in a giant trampoline up to nearly 30 feet in height , and they will perform a spinning series of movements ( translation , layouts and somersaults ) and finally landed on his feet .
official olympic program , according to their evaluation of execution , difficulty , and ” flight time ” basis .
the rio will compete with 32 athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women .
general olympic direction is straight forward .
a medal i hope the need to go for the gold while looking for further , faster , up and over - sometimes paint , sometimes back and forth around the field .
they don &apos;t hunt just the finish line or the start of a wall , but also , in a televised news coverage , repeat to make a mockery of the cross : the world or olympic record .
this resolute pursuit is noble , admirable , and even fanatical - and it can get up to the viewer to tears .
but it is also the reason why the race of looking at it can be a little exhausting .
a trampoline offers a moment of rest in this .
the trampoline is up .
the goal is not to move forward .
competition on the rise new rise affecting weightless like an astronaut , going up , then down , then effortlessly again up .
this does not , of course , lack of competition and difficulty , but during the program is not a fierce rush towards the end , not jumps into the distance , only time and gravity of dreamy , melting the interruption .
it is as close to a zen space , than what the olympics can be achieved .
women &apos;s qualifier competition and then the finals will be conducted friday afternoon broadcast begins at 13 ( et ) , men &apos;s race to come on saturday also at 13 .
nbc broadcast the finals as part of the afternoon its repertoire from the clock 14 both days .
olympic fever in the middle of the they offer a quiet , pleasant moment , which probably was not noticed in the general chaos .
and if awareness is achieved only by providing a male athletes stare at and as a material for recycling ( such as the us male gymnastics some time ago suggested by the wall street journal ) , dooley just waiting for the sighed , satisfying new fans .
” generations of protest ” in ethiopia , which is the u.s. long-term allies
violent protests in ethiopia
political change in ethiopia demanded the protesters have faced government violent resistance .
eyewitnesses say that dozens of protesters have been shot dead with the police happened in the clashes .
is ethiopia in the fracture ?
during the last decade it has been one of africa &apos;s most stable states , the west &apos;s strong allies , whose economy is growing rapidly .
in recent months the government opposed the protests have , however , shaken the country levitessään more regions .
last week alone , thousands of people rushed to the streets to demand fundamental political change .
human rights groups , according to the government &apos;s response was relentless .
witnesses said that police shot and killed dozens of unarmed protesters .
spread , demonstrations , recorded videos , which is believed to be the last year in the end or the beginning of this year , show how the safety authority are hitting the sticks of the young people at the same time , when these were forced to stand with their hands against the wall .
the united nations pääihmisoikeusviranomainen now requires a thorough research .
” this country together was always difficult , and in the future it will be even more difficult , ” said rashid abdi , who is the horn of africa project manager for the international crisis group research group .
ethiopia is nigeria after africa &apos;s second most populous country , and the west will appreciate its stability .
america &apos;s military and intelligence services cooperate closely with ethiopia with the fighting in the area of terrorist threats against particular in somalia , and there is hardly any african country receives so much western help .
the ethiopian economy has grown at an impressive pace .
its infrastructure has improved extremely much , and the capital addis ababa there is even a new commuter train .
the city streets are typically quiet , safe and clean .
although not ethiopia have , however , been a model of democracy pictures . human rights organisations have constantly been talking about government oppression , the country &apos;s opposition has been limited , and dissent is silenced effectively .
many have been expelled from the country , imprisoned , killed or driven far away from the desert .
but this may be changing .
” if you repress the people , and they have no other option than to protest , this was going to happen ” , seyoum mulat teshome , a university teacher in central ethiopia , said .
the whole youth protest .
one generation to protest .
the complaints are many and cover everything from land use to the ruling coalition &apos;s power in a chokehold .
in recent years much criticism of the election after the ruling party and its allies got the last of the opposition of the place , and now it holds all the seats in the parliament .
at the same time tensions on the eritrean border are increasing . this tense and disputed border along the fight requires hundreds of lives in june .
analysts fear that separatist groups such as the oromo liberation front or the ogaden national liberation front , which in recent years more or less defeated , can try to use the turmoil to arm ourselves again .
numerous factors explain why the year beneath the surface of bumping after the bitter feelings are now about to explode .
the first affected by the seemingly harmless : smartphones .
only in the last few years , large number of ethiopians have been able to communicate through social media , when the cheapest smartphones have become commonplace and the internet service improved .
even if the government would shut access to facebook and twitter , as it often does , especially during demonstrations , many people can still message location hide the network proxy through the .
many young ethiopians said that in this way they gathered in the demonstrations .
secondly , ethiopia &apos;s two largest ethnic groups , oromot and amharat , get along much better with each other .
oromot and amharat are not natural allies .
for a very long time amharat , who came to ethiopia in the predominantly christian highlands , success in politics and in business , using the advantage of the oromo , many of whom are muslims and who live in the lowlands .
but this too is changing .
” we &apos;re on our way towards the organisation under one umbrella ” , oromojohtaja mulatu gemechu said .
the biggest demonstrations have been in the amharic and oromoalueilla .
many amharat and oromot think that ethiopia is dominated by shabbily tigre-people belong to . people covers about six percent of the population and dominates the armed forces , intelligence services , trade and policy .
the third cause of unrest is meles zenawi loss .
meles , a former rebel leader , was the prime minister of ethiopia for 17 years until , when he died the secret of the disease in 2012 .
he was regarded as a tactical genius , a man who can see around corners .
analysts say that he was particularly qualified to observe the early discontent of characters and the use of secret envoys opponents in the harmless making .
” regime zero is not like basic instinct , ” conflict analyst abdi said .
the new ethiopian prime minister , hailemariam desalegn , was picked as a relatively unknown to fulfill meles ’ n boots .
unlike meles , who was a native of northern ethiopia , the tigre-area , hailemariam is from the south .
analysts say that the tigre of control by the security services don &apos;t trust him .
many fear that this may lead to increased bloodshed .
the last time ethiopia had such turmoil in power since 2005 , when thousands were protesting the elections , which according to analysts was affected by it , that the government &apos;s first botched and after robbing them .
in the ensuing crackdown , many protesters died , although less than in recent months , and that unease of the period went by relatively quickly .
development experts have praised the ethiopian leaders with vision for infrastructure design , such as new commuter trains , and the significant advances in poverty in the reverse in the battle .
but clearly , this has not stopped the country &apos;s internal ethiopian government contempt potentiation .
and now it starts to get dangerous , ethnic the shape .
last month , protesters amharic-city gondarissa attacked tigre owned companies attacked , and tigre anti-hate is becoming more common on social media .
analysts say that the protests have put the united states and other western allies of bungling the drive .
the american government has used ethiopia as a base for drone flights to neighbouring somalia , although it some time ago said that he shut this base .
although the western countries clearly want to support democracy , they also do not want to already unstable region allies plummet .
” this , ” abdi said , ” it is a real balancing act . ”
donald trump explains obama-based on-isis-claims ” sarcasm ”
donald j. trump tried to suppress the latest campaign to take over the dispute on friday by claiming that he wasn &apos;t serious when he this week numerous times insisted that president obama and hillary clinton were the islamic state terrorist group ” based ” .
the statement sparked new questions about the republican presidential candidate &apos;s ability to communicate clearly with the american public .
it also set his guard , who have fought has been to defend her stormy period , in the difficult position where they have to explain the remarks , which he does not necessarily mean .
on wednesday evening a campaign meeting to make the allusion of after trump said the same thing increasingly in thursday &apos;s interviews , in which he insisted that his intention really was to say that the president and clinton created isis .
early friday morning the twitter-published in trump , however , said that he was just being sarcastic .
the release was a reversal from the previous day , when trump said in several interviews he was really serious accusation .
when conservative radio host hugh hewitt trying to help trump flare point about reminding him that obama wants to destroy isis , the republican presidential candidate taken this fell on deaf ears .
the last review of the storm comes a situation where trump has sought to re-focus its campaign on the economy of falling opinion poll results in the middle .
trump and clinton fighting speaking about the economy this week in michigan .
on friday , trump tried once again return to the topic .
escape again to twitter , he warned that clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes , and that he liked the speech boring before .
trump has a history of using the sarcasm defense .
late in july , after she faced widespread criticism for apparently suggesting that the russians should be hacked clinton e-mails , he later explained the comments by saying ” of course i &apos;m being sarcastic ” .
the approach makes it possible that trump can take a political speech on the borders and then return back when required .
” i think that it is a model , which he tested on certain messages that are important to his fans . he looked at how they work and then ’ clarify ’ in one direction or another depending on the reaction , ” said ruth sherman , a communications expert who has been following both candidates &apos; use of language .
but i also think that he is a clever opinions with respect and to know that they are vague enough so that they can be filtered a number of different lenses through .
instead , that would alleviate says the high turnout of the audience for trump in recent days has been former sapekkaampi , when his popularity has continued to decline .
new , friday released nbc / wall street journal / marist poll survey showed that trump lags clinton behind considerably in north carolina , virginia and colorado , and that the race is tight in florida .
although trump as a rule , seeks to avoid sorry to say any provocative things , he often blames arvostelijoitaan words wrong comprehension or sense of humor being misunderstood .
his face still closer examination of the presidential campaign over the past few months , trump &apos;s a joke , you have forced his loyal allies in the uncomfortable position where they have to publicly support him regardless of how provocative his comments are .
new york &apos;s former mayor rudolph w. giuliani , which is one of trump &apos;s most prominent supporters , saw a lot of effort defending the candidate from the cnn in an interview thursday .
” i believe that in his words is real , political comments ” , giuliani said , when asked about the veracity related to trump &apos;s claim that as obama and clinton are based on the islamic state .
it is true in the sense that before obama isis was almost unknown , small organization , which he called an amateur , completely wrong , and that &apos;s why this happened , because he pulled the troops out of iraq .
most mainstream republicans try to claim that the obama administration , where clinton worked for the foreign minister , allowed isis to get worse , because it was unable to effectively handle the situation in the middle east .
before pennsylvania friday meetings trump continued twitter attack toward the news media , who will grind his every word and are biased against him .
he mocked ” poor , pathetic ” television experts , who are trying to get him out , saying ” they will not succeed ! ”
some democrats mocked trump excuses new evidence that he is unfit to be president .

a square meal : depression , crippling food
in march 1933 , soon to be president when franklin delano roosevelt sat down to eat lunch in the oval office .
herkkusuuna president roosevelt had sophisticated fifth avenue of food , such as goose liver pate , and the maryland terrapin soup .
that day , his diet was more modest : stuffed eggs in tomato sauce , mashed potatoes and for dessert , plum pudding .
” it was a culinary act of solidarity with people who suffer ” , jane ziegelman said .
her spouse , andrew coe , added : ” it was also a message to americans about how we should eat . ”
brooklyn heights resident couples is the food historians .
coen &apos;s last book , chop suey , told the chinese food in america , and ziegelman tells the story of life on the lower east side apartment house of food season book 97 orchard .
their latest collaboration , a square meal , which harper will publish on tuesday , is a history of the american food of the 1930s during the great depression .
by showing some of their own culinary solidarity , they meet a vendor for dinner eisenberg &apos;s sandwich shop , a tiny , unsophisticated in the lunch bar in the flatiron building in the area , which has been in operation since 1929 the stock market crash since .
ziegelman , 54 , ordered a cream cheese-olive sandwiches , and coe , 57 , took a dose of turkey , a side of mashed potatoes and vegetables .
when a reporter ordered the meatloaf , the couple see fit to discuss depression eating .
” murekkeet were very popular ” , ziegelman said .
was peanut loaf , liver loaf , papumureketta .
they were made to prepare the substance and to some cheap ingredients , which extended the actual manufacturer of the substance .
imagine eating so many peanuts , that they would become dinner .
coe grimaced .
” it is certainly felt in the stomach leaden from , ” he said .
in the years before the depression the americans on the table , especially in rural areas , was like a eat-as-much-as-you-can-pick-up table .
women &apos;s groups are making food for male farm workers , and fresh pie was served at breakfast , lunch and dinner .
the americans sent food to the starving europeans during the first world war . a square meal -the book chronicles the ways in which the nation cope with the fact that it suddenly was no longer the land of plenty .
” at that time , food became the central , oppressive subject to the americans ” , coe said , explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it .
equally oppressive was the new , low-cost diet : a mystery dish , such as murekkeista and boxes , main dishes , and the box was ” a great way to use leftovers ” , mentioned ziegelman , as the chefs were able to hide less attractive ingredients in the creamy sauce under a layer of .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit .
the meat , which was one year old american meals at the center , be sparingly dosed in a luxury product .
special composed for the experiment was the number of calories and the nutrient content was more important than taste or even common sense in the kitchen .
in doing research are also recipes included in the book for the ziegelman manufacturing era dish , with fried onions filled with peanut butter .
” it was not a popular extra at the dinner table , ” coe said .
ziegelman stated : ” it was unreal . ”
peanut butter does not in any way fit into the fried onions .
this was characteristic for many household recipes .
home economic experts , such as louise stanley , federal home financial agency director in the years 1923-1943 , directed the country &apos;s eating habits more than ever before or after .
published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encourage women to start ” budjetoijien ” and to meet the challenge of converting soseutetun spaghetti and carrots-like blobs like the taste as doses .
a square meal is the historical tidbit of the feast .
especially tasty are the reports the government &apos;s reaction to the hungry citizens , including president herbert hoover let me eat cake attitude .
at the same time , when he publicly praised his childhood in simple , iowa types of common food , he dined as a sophisticated millionaire who she had become .
” he liked continental food , such as fish , cucumber sauce , ” coe said .
he ate almost gold-plated in the dining room wearing a tuxedo .
he was the greatest outdoors of all .
president roosevelt could have made the same mistake , unless his wife , eleanor , had encouraged him not to as an example in your own stomach .
as in the book , when mrs . roosevelt hired the housekeeper , who had no interest in taste , from the white house to become a place that ” not only offered to washington ankeimpia , but also suck more prepared food . ”
many of the early dining was rejected as soon as a country get back on its feet .
inheritance is a constant focus of calories and nutrition , ziegelman said , and the way how science applies to cooking .
the couple said that while writing the book , they reached a better understanding of the ziegelmanin mother &apos;s eating habits , for example , about how he couldn &apos;t throw food away .
” he really was afraid of food waste ” , coe said .
ziegelman recalled : ” he even got sick of people . ”
event eclair incident .
after the plates were empty eisenberg in , he and coe pulled out the dessert that they had prepared at home : a plum dessert , which president roosevelt ate for lunch .
” it &apos;s called plum froth ” , ziegelman said , adding that the most common trick was to give requires with a recipe for a showy name .
dessert no whipped cream , just prunes , a little flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
all sank his spoon reluctantly sticky , brown liisteriin .
surprisingly , it wasn &apos;t bad .
coe santsasi time and another .
sounds like a positive budjetoija he told his wife : ” a little chopped walnuts could help ” .

scot callum skinner plunged to the finish of the british caught in the cycling of gold
scotland &apos;s callum skinner sped to glory in the men &apos;s team sprint in rio , biking in the stadium last night , when the british team of the trio to defend his title in london in 2012 .
glasgow from the 23-year-old was an anchor role , with his scottish colleagues in the sir chris roy to excel , the legend was a young man proud , as it sped to the finish to grab the win , the favorites , the new zealand team .
britain took a shock victory four years ago , at the same time when hoy won the fifth of the six olympic gold .
and they repeated the trick sijoituttua modestly sixth march for track world cup in london , although hoy has since decided racing career .
beijing and london between the races , the problem was a special posted by jamie staff replacement .
this was achieved just in time , when hindes appeared .
hoyn end also created a vacuum , which kian emadi and matt crampton are trying to fill .
skinner was a man , with the british coaches got caught in front of the scot in the potential , which now is understood .
hindes , kenny - who win hoyn with the championship four years ago - and skinner are doing olympic record time-in time , but new zealand took the lead in the first round .
and the british trio won the duel of gold .
hindes was your round after narrowly behind , but kenny pushed the team &apos;s lead , and skinner were clinging to it .
the strategy change was a big part of the deformation , and it includes hindes was driving a bigger gear , so he would slow down and allow kenny and especially skinner to hold on to the pace .
hoy followed the status of the bbc as an expert , and drew the attention of skinner , kenny and hindes &apos;s attention to them when he took the podium .
23-year-old from glasgow skinner said : ” the comparison is flattering . ”
i &apos;m just here to do my best and get my fame .
we made the finals of the olympic record and win the world champion .
it was absolutely incredible .
there may be better ways to win .
after winning the london 2012 kenny and hoyn alongside hindes admitted that it was intentionally crashed on the track of a bad start .
he later pulled the comments back , and the british racing partner you have been complaining .
this time superior won &apos;t have similar problems .
hindes said : ” it seems when it would have been in london , when the pedestal was so much of great britain tickets . ”
as a team we can find a joint in the last three months .
we have lost so many world championships , so the olympic games , winning once again is simply stunning .
one event , one gold medal to the people who won seven in total , ten of the cycling species as well as in beijing and london .
if this reflects the final five months of development , we expect successful five days of cycling in the stadium .
kenny &apos;s shown a proper basis is not at all impossible to imagine him playing hoyn trials , three olympic gold win at the olympics .
it would mean that kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than hoy , who is also the born 23. march ( that , apparently , the holy day of british sport , which is also steve redgrave , mo farah and roger bannister &apos;s birthday ) - medal total rose to six gold and one silver .
it would be the same as the hoyl .
kenny competes in next sprint , which starts today and lasts for three days .
bolton native , the 28-year-old said : ” i enjoy now just this one .
the team competition is always the best .
to win it together with your friends .
alone winning is , frankly , lonely . ”
hindes said : ” if he wins another two gold medals , we should give him a knighthood . ”
this was the day &apos;s only medal race , but the british got more good news .
sir bradley wiggins , ed clancy , steven burke and owain doull were the time-a time faster than four-person , four-kilometre team pursuit .
their time was 3 : 51 : 943 .
london 2012 gold-winning world record of 3 : 51 : 659 .
the first round and the finals ( 22.42 ) held today , the second race , when wiggins is certainly the center of attention .
he had a dispute with the judges last night before the time trials , when the clerk called him to the length measurement .
in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which continues and ends tomorrow , laura trott , joanna rowsell shand , elinor barker and milngavie &apos;s katie archibald are advancing the world record time for the clock to stop the time 4 : 13 : 260 .
the british team has learned to trust that its an awesome cycling team to take over the olympic games in the middle part and achieve a whole bunch of medals .
having presented in beijing and in london a truly exceptional and the perfect management of expectations is the understatement before the rio olympics .
the background has been in drama with minor have not been technical director , shane sutton , the difference in april , sexism - and the temptation charges , as well as suurhenkilö awards , such as the hoyn and victoria pendleton , racing to the end .
based on the first night of competition for cycling in the stadium , however , it seems that britain &apos;s now legendary reputation rose to the pinnacle of a perfect moment would have to once again place .
the portland smelter in the future to question the electricity contract because of the reduction in
portland victoria &apos;s aluminum smelter , as well as the hundreds of workers &apos; jobs , the future is uncertain , when the factory electricity distribution dominant electricity company revealed that one of the factory owners is decided by the distribution agreement , so it is expected of all distribution agreements surgery .
the measures follow the victorian government earlier this year , a decision taken by the plant operation in keeping the required support is not extended .
20 year specified period , the subsidy will end in november .
up to 2000 jobs could be in danger , alcoa &apos;s portland factory .
up to 2000 jobs could be in danger , directly or indirectly , of the factory closure .
in addition , a snowball effect may be possible , as the smelter uses about 10 % of victoria &apos;s total electricity production .
2014 alcoa to close point henry smelter , which led to last year &apos;s angle sean power plant closure .
alcoa &apos;s portland smelter lose money and is sulkemisuhan below .
the measures follow now already several years that speculation in the factory of the future , which began as a result of the strong australian dollar and has recently been due to the factory production price .
agl , which distributes electricity to a large aluminum smelter latrobe valley is located in loy yang an power child said that it also expects the other three to the owner to decide on his contract .
most of the factory owned by alcoa and alumina group , and the chinese citic and the japanese marubeni corp owning smaller shares .
” agl expects the portland plant &apos;s continued operation , which means that the smelter physical electricity demand will continue , ” it said .
fd : according to the agreements are the so-called ” hedging agreements ” , which was supposed to come into force in november 2016 .
agreements have a 12-month notice period , so they run out of the actual year 2017 .
” for that reason , agl expects the contracts to produce results account year 2017 ” , the electricity company said .
all possible results effects of agl for the fiscal year 2018 forward limit currently wholesale electricity prices in the futures market with strong prospects .
agl said that it is already the ” end of anticipation ” reduced value of the contracts to the accounting of its 187 million dollars .

the us company said that it signed 20-year agreement to loy yang in 2010 , and that the agreement should enter into force in november this year , but it has not yet explained why withdraw from the contract .
analysts have been alert to as well as in victoria at portland smelter , also that newcastle is close to tomagon plant possible closure because the economic situation is poor .
earlier this week agl &apos;s operations manager stephen mikkelsen said analysts , that portland uses each year about 600 mega watts of electricity and tomagon about 900 megawatts .
” if both plants exit the market , this is a significant reduction in the &#91; electricity &#93; market demand .
us producer of electricity , this would not be a good thing , ” he said .
kendall , not a mere kardashianien reality tv star , is the september vogue cover
kendall jenner , 20 , model and mother-manager kris kardashian-jenner clan , the fourth daughter , is the us vogue to the september issue cover .
kendall , who is estee lauder &apos;s brand ambassador and was a model in milan , paris and new york fashion week , announced the news thursday on instagram account .
” this deck watching a room full of people i love , made me cry , ” kendall wrote .
the cover announced to follow an eccentric ( or maybe just kardashianien style appropriate ? ) , scripted reality video , in which the entire kardashian-jenner clan ( excluding the problem cases , rob and caitlyn , and involving all of your favorite entertainment uncle , keeping up producer ryan seacrest ) to forget about the sister deck , but which ended with a classic twist : they told me to see a surprise party .
it is in almost every children &apos;s television series ” the birthday episode ” cliché plot pattern ( seacrest uttered the words ” you didn &apos;t think that we will forget you ” morning cartoons bunny &apos;s credibility ) , but kris got to get another girl to somehow benefit from this publicity .
this is because we have certainly moved to a new kardashianien era in the september issue of vogue the place .
kendall &apos;s big sister kim may get on the cover of vogue first ( he shared it with her husband kanye west in april 2014 ) , but the magazine &apos;s september issue is just a class of its own .
vogue &apos;s september issue is the size of the year &apos;s most-selling edition .
the thickness of more like a coffee table book than a fashion magazine , and number attracts a huge number of advertisers ( fashionista calculated that last year &apos;s 832-page opus on the 615 was the ad content ) .
its cover star revelations is expected to so fiercely , that in the last two years , images from magazines have leaked before the official announcement .
earlier women on the cover have included naomi campbell , linda evangelista and kate moss .
in recent years , the cover has indeed been more ” celebrities , who act as models ” as ” models who are celebrities ” .
oscar-winner and dior ambassador jennifer lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , the year of lady gaga in a place of honor .
but if you happen to be , that jenner , which the magazine describes generation ” model of success ” , would hit the first mentioned category , he is pretty good company .
these celebrities are not famous people , relatives , or reality stars or today &apos;s young people , who can make a good snapchat video ( although jenner is all of this ) .
they are legitimately talented women who are successful in the entertainment industry .
last year &apos;s cover model beyoncé has been lemonaden released a career of the strongest of the year .
not everyone , of course , not pleased with jenner &apos;s success .
his reality tv history jenner &apos;s position in the world of fashion will always be ticklish .
in june , the original victoria &apos;s secret model stephanie seymour reviews jenneriä and this colleague gigi hadidi to calling them &quot; this moment bitches ” .
this feeling rose again to the surface of the jenner vogue cover .
but dissatisfied selling the bike is irrelevant .
kendall jenner is vogue &apos;s september issue cover .
she is a super model of the word in the purest sense .
he is a model for marc jacobs .
he sells you on estee lauder makeup cream .

community legal centers to turn in their annual out of the 160 000 people
more than 160 000 people most vulnerable are being turned each year out of the community legal centres , when the sector is preparing for the financing of additional cuts on already stretched operation .
in queensland three out of five people - mainly the elderly , immigrants , injured workers , victims of violence , those who do not have a chance to fight unfair evictions , and similar against - the turn is already out of their search for free legal advice and representation .
the community was already pushed to its limits stretching used legal services are preparing for further cuts .
next year in june , these legal centres is the amount of lose 30 percent of federal funding .
queensland community legal centres director james farrell said that the latest national association of community legal centres -the calculation according to the report , thousands of people turned already out a year .
farrell said that if the federal government &apos;s decision is not reversed , the situation will only get worse .
” queensland community legal centres are chronically underfunded , which means that every year thousands of people are being turned away from their needs of essential services , ” he said .
people who are leaving violent relationships , which is uncontrollable and rampauttavia debt , separated families , unfairly fired workers - all these people have legal problems , and this report shows that they do not get the help they need .
the federal government cut funding by 30 % in june 2017 , which means that thousands of vulnerable queensland residents are forced to navigate complex legal problems without help .
we appeal to the attorney general and queensland senator george brandisi , that they immediately withdraw these funding cuts , so that people can get the help they need in legal problems .
last year , the state government carried out its promise to raise legal aid funding , the national average level .
now is the time to look at the community legal centre and their customer communities needs , and a piece of szczuka government will invest in this important work .

the british need to channel the olympic spirit and to expand heathrow
heathrow bring to the recovery and prosperity of the entire stomach , not just the local community and across london .
for myself this was heathrow of great charm , as it was also the london 2012 games charm , when we saw a huge amount of effort to ensure that all of our people and our region would benefit from the games .
the olympic games brought about huge benefits to the stratford and east endille .
and we do so again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses in the heathrow vicinity .
only local communities creating 10 000 new training places and 40,000 new jobs , and the elimination of youth unemployment around the airport .
as well as before the london 2012 games , some of the times to come spoke that challenge to heathrow expansion is too large .
i was told that the british would never have finished the race , and that that would put to shame before the world .
the skeptics were wrong in 2012 , and they &apos;re going to be wrong at heathrow .
obstacles are always overcome , but heathrow answer every question which it is presented .
like the olympics , also heathrow is an infrastructure project for many , not the few .
the extension is the possibility to create up to 180 000 new jobs and 211 billion. pounds economic growth , and to leave a skills and employment legacy as well as around the airport and around the uk .
we have heathrow amazing team that has taken 11 billion. pound infrastructure investment programme on time and budget : t5 , who has been voted the world &apos;s best airport terminal your five in a row , the t2 one , which was built for the world &apos;s two busiest runways .
now the team is ready to implement the third runway , supported by 16 billion. pounds of private money .
london olympic games 2012 were a great success for britain , and i am convinced also that the heathrow expansion is it .
it is time for us to channel the olympic spirit and to expand heathrow , to ensure our trade future and to create a skills and employment legacy of which britain can be proud of .
lord paul deighton is the heathrow board chairman and former ministry of finance , the commercial secretary .
adblock plus and facebook cat-and-mouse in ad blocking
for businesses that receive money from online advertising companies bypass ad blocking software are in the ” cat and mouse ” , said one such program manufacturing companies .
on thursday , just two days after facebook announced that it would block ads to prevent the computer used on their website , adblock plus release blog post , which said that users can update the program filters prevent again ads on social network pages .
on tuesday facebook said that its website code to change the ads around , so that ad blockers would be more difficult to detect , which parts of the page are ads .
but now adblock says it has toured the new code .
the blog post adblock representative ben williams wrote that ” this kind of a back and forth battle to open the source code of the ads to prevent the community and its circumvention of intermediaries has been running ever since , when ad blocking was invented ” , and that it is possible that facebook comes up with its own solution soon .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has taken part in the battle , there is a strong indication of how the great grief of ad inhibitors have become the industry .
worldwide , about 200 million use the ad-blocking , multiply last year pagefairin and adobe study . this is almost fourfold the amount spent on these programs in 2013 .
to 1.03 million active daily users use facebook on mobile devices , and mobile advertising now covers 84 % of facebook &apos;s advertising revenue .
however , the company is a computer used for the pages of ad blockers behind , for mobile ad blocking not working facebook mobile applications , social network or instagram which , the representative said .
computer ads that are still enough revenue , so facebook considers this a measure such as the value of the investment in order to .
also tuesday , facebook said it would update the ” ad preferences ” -työkaluaan to give people more control in terms of how ads targeted at them .
on thursday facebook claimed that adblock new filters were a concern because they would prevent also part of the website other than advertising content .
” this is not a good experience for people , and we have plans to address the problem ” , a facebook representative said in an email statement .
ad block are dull tools , which is why we have instead focused on building the ad preferences such as tools , which give management people .
a woman was hit by a car on a swiss highway , apparently a suicide due to
the victim was lying on the freeway in the middle of the night .
police are looking for witnesses after a woman was hit on the freeway often a vehicle under thursday &apos;s early hours of the case , which was apparently suicide .
the incident occurred the a1 road near morges in vaud canton just after midnight on thursday .
the woman made a ” desperate deed ” and settled in the dark to lie down on the road where he was hit several vehicles , vaud police said in the statement .
the victim , who clearly tried to kill himself , was a 49-year-old swiss woman , which hit several vehicles , including a truck .
he died at the scene .
several event-related drivers have already been questioned , but all have yet to be identified , told the police that appealed to them and all the scene witnessed witnesses to make themselves known .
a criminal investigation has been started , what is ” logical ” step in a situation like this , the lawyer gilles hoffstetter told le tribune de genevelle .
” however , it remains to be seen if anyone involved drivers charges .
was it possible to avoid the collision ?
it remains the prosecutor &apos;s settlement ” , hoffstetter said .
the last five years , two similar cases suggest that the drivers will not be held responsible .
in either case - both of which was a person who walked in the dark on the freeway - it was estimated that motorists may not expect pedestrians on the freeway in the middle of the night , the paper said .
last year , police were acquitted regarding neglect due to death by her after hitting and killing a man who was lying a ! -on the road near paynernea one night in august 2014 .
22-year-old victim had been drinking and was passed out on the road , the court was told .
the court found that the police officer who was responding to an emergency call , drove through a reasoned way , and that man &apos;s presence on the road was ” completely exceptional and unpredictable situation , ” the judge said .
all , with information about thursday &apos;s incident near morges ’ ta , will call the police number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 .
nasa &apos;s climate models : venus was once habitable
nasa &apos;s new climate model estimates of venus was likely once habitable .
scientists at the nasa goddard institute for space studies -the research center developed a model to study the venus of the past using the tools and algorithms that are similar in climate research the used with .
the model was designed to find out whether venus hot , anhydrous pintoineen and carbon dioxide täyttämine air kehineen could sometimes be earth-like conditions .
scientists have previously suggested that venus &apos;s slow rotation speed to explain its thick atmosphere .
but the last simulation suggests that venus could have been a thin , earth-like atmosphere , and it would still be able to rotate slowly .
the model also examined the early venus surface formation .
the planet was likely to land in drier regions , but there was once enough water and the geographical variation of life enabling safe and fast water haihtumiselta protection .
early venus had the advantage of a 30 % dimmer sun .
” gissin model in the simulation of venus &apos;s slow rotation to disclose in its day side to the sun for almost two months at a time , ” gissin scientist anthony del genio explained to the news bulletin .
this heats the surface and produces precipitation , which creates a thick cloud layer , which acts as an umbrella for the protection of the surface of a large part of the heat of the sun .
as a result of climate , average temperatures are in fact a few degrees cooler than the current .
model production of venus , the stage of development of the story , which is similar to what the planetary scientists had previously assumed .
although venus most likely was once habitable , it was exposed to excessive heat and ultra-violet light for several billion years .
its oceans evaporated and the water vapour returns to the ultraviolet light .
when the hydrogen escaped , leaving only a thick carbon dioxide-atmospheric kill with the greenhouse gas phenomenon and venus , which we know today .
scientists share the results of the new venus climate model of the geophysical research letters publication .
patrick roy give up the avalanche coaching job of the
patrick roy quit on thursday the colorado avalanche coach and hockey affairs deputy director-general of the action words as the reason for the influence of the absence of the team &apos;s decision-making process .
colorado executive vice president / general manager joe sousa confirmed the information and mentioned that the team will start new coach search immediately .
” in the past three years i have done my duty colorado avalanche hockey affairs as vice president and as head coach of the enthusiasm , passion and determination ” , 50-year-old roy said in the statement .
i &apos;m thinking of summer during the long and hard how i could improve this team to give it the necessary depth and take it to a higher level .
for this to be achieved , the coach and the hockey affairs deputy director general &apos;s view should be fully aligned with the organization &apos;s vision .
he must also have the opportunity to influence decisions that affect the team &apos;s performance .
these conditions are not currently implemented .
sousa , who hired roy &apos;s 23. may 2013 , thank you roy for this contribution to the team .
” patrick told me today of their decision ” , sousa said .
we appreciate everything he has done for the organization , and we wish him good luck in the future .
roy was named the league &apos;s best coach the jack adams award as the first avalanche of the season is 2013-14 .
he led the team to 112 points and the central division of the victory , but minnesota fell to colorado in the playoffs in the first round , and the team have in the last two years to reach the next round .
avalanche games season 2015-16 ended with 39 wins , 39 losses and 4 draw , and the team lost five points wildille losing in the western conference wild card playoff spot .

north sea oil workers continue negotiations and postpone stop
north sea oil workers &apos; industrial action , wages due will be postponed , when all the parties to the dispute sit down to a new round of negotiations for the lead negotiators said .
strikes oil field services company wood group has arranged randomly royal dutch shell , led by north sea rigs .
” wood group as well as unite and the rmt-the union can confirm that we have agreed to start again the process with the aim of the current dispute settlement ” , in connection with the opinion to read .
we consider in the next few weeks during several all-day meetings starting from early next week , so we can take problems fresh viewpoint .
trade unions according to their recent industrial action , which they say will be the first for more than 25 years , was a protest potential , up to 30 % wage cuts .
this year wood group to cut north sea contractor fees of about 9 % in a negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s premium reduction will follow its countries of contractors 10 % reduction from 2014 .
the company said that further cuts would give the company the necessary scope for the market downturn to survive .
shell , in turn , has contracted with thousands of people on the payroll and announced plans to leave the oil and gas activities up to 10 in the country , when companies reduce their activities as a result of its giant merger with the british energy company bg group .
energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , and this economic situation is exacerbated by britain &apos;s summer decision to leave the european union .
a scottish member of parliament dave anderson met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the generation of the largest north sea työriidoista .
he said that the north sea is essential for the region &apos;s economy .
” we need an economy that works for the many , not the few , so the north sea than in the whole country , ” he said in the statement .
the north sea is expected in 2016 less than 1.4 billion dollars in investments in new projects , while the previous five-year average has been about $ 7 billion .
kepler measurements of stellar rotation rate from the pleiades star cluster in
the last of the kepler space telescope mission has helped astronomers to gather a more complete list of the pleiades star cluster star rotational speeds .
the new data will help astronomers understand why the stars number the stars rotating at varying speeds , as well as how cycle time related to planet formation .
” we hope that by comparing our results to other stars in the corps , we have now learned more of the star &apos;s mass , its age and even its solar system , the history of the relationship between ” , caltech &apos;s infrared processing and analysis of the pasadena center researcher luisa rebun on said in a press release
the pleiades star cluster is located in 445 light-years from earth .
many of the mass stars are born with around 125 million years ago , and are just now reaching adulthood .
it &apos;s now rotating at top level .
the peak rotational speed of these grow up to the stars , plunging into large quantities of star tuula .
when these winds pass through the star &apos;s magnetic field through , they slow the stars .
when a star gets older , its speed of rotation starts to slow down .
kepler measures each star rotation speed by following the recognizable star of the spots appeared , such as sun spots .
the last star of the rotational speed of the list suggests that the massive most stars are rotating slower than less massive stars .
rebun on comparing the stars to the dancers , with bigger doing pirouettes slower than smaller ones .
” the pleiades ” at the ballet ” we see that the slow pyörijät are usually massive , while the fastest pyörijät are usually very light of the stars ” , rebun in said .
because the pleiades star cluster is so close , it is an ideal cosmic laboratory for the stars to assess the properties of rotational speeds .
” the pleiades star cluster provides the anchor of the star wheel of the theoretical models , which comprise both directions , younger and older ” , rebun in said .
we still have a lot to learn about how , when and why stars slow down the rotation speed and , so to speak , hung their ’ dancing shoes ’ on a nail .
rebun , and his colleagues filmed the last analysis , the pleiades rotational speeds of the three in the article , which will be published shortly in the astronomical journal .
