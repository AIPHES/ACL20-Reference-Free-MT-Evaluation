the british medical association junior doctors committee will require all of its members since the beginning of nine months to support more industrial action .
junior doctors committee , said ministers did not address concerns about the contract .
junior doctors and medical students voted to boycott in july with the british medical association to reach a contract deal .
members of the polled , 58 per cent against the contracts traded .
junior doctor committee chair ellen mccourt , posted on twitter late on thursday in a letter to members , the letter says , the question of a boycott has led to a contract , the government was &quot; always remain silent . &quot;
she said : &quot; in light of this , junior doctors committee &apos;s executive committee had voted overall rejection of the proposed new contract and calls on all concerned to formal consultation . &quot;

russia and turkey : &quot; antipathetic union &quot; ?
a gesture to put an end to a crisis .
the russian and turkish leaders meet on tuesday , the two sides announced a formal end to shake hands and up to eight months of rhetoric and economic sanctions .
however , when vladimir putin , in a st. petersburg golden palace to meet in the lobby of the turkish president , i have a strong feeling : this reconciliation is ankara &apos;s most want to see .
yes , indeed , both sides shook hands .
however , even as mr. putin has always reserved standards , mr putin is just shallow smiles , almost did not exude fervor .
according to reports , recep tayyip erdogan is five times referred to a &quot; good friend &quot; putin .
i don &apos;t remember .
at the same time , he promised to relations with russia will return to levels before the crisis , and even reached a higher level .
the next day , when a newspaper wrote that mr erdogan would act like that had ever happened .
but i think his passion hint at some of the stuff .
however , mr putin continued apathetic attitude that suggests he is not forgotten .
in fact , he mentioned in his opening remarks , the first thing this time is the cause of the crisis : syrian border in turkey shot down a russian fighter aircraft .
moscow &apos;s reaction was very intense .
mr. putin , in response to the incident , accusing ankara savaged in the back to moscow .
attacks from so-called friends are much harder to accept .
both sides are very difficult , even impossible , to recreate the real confidence .
since the start of november , the russian public opinion has been reversed .
for months , the media is controlled by the government in ankara has been shocking to attack .
all of a sudden , the turks seem to want responsibility for everything .
of these , the most serious came from senior officials accused of : mr erdogan &apos;s family from the so-called islamic state in syria under the control of the illicit oil trading profit .
he has categorically denied the claim .
however , the news from st. petersburg shows , it is time to move on .
after all this time on the premise that putin met turkish president recep tayyip erdogan has received an apology .
russia could declare victory .
for ankara , the truce for benefit is obvious .
first , put mr erdogan last month after a failed coup nearly ousted , so he will need all the support of friends .
constant terror attacks has clearly caused him considerable fight .
there are also economic motives .
russian sanctions against turkey on a large , particularly the prohibition would transport every year millions of russian tourists to turkey coast charter services .
that number has tumbled nearly 90 per cent .
with the resumption of flights , russian tour operators and charter companies will breathe a sigh of relief .
they will come to an end the mediterranean tourism boom .
even on national television this week predicted that once the turkish agricultural imports , to let go of the fruit and vegetable prices will decline .
one moscow newspaper vedra mosti reported : &quot; tourists go , tomato back . &quot;
for the visit to moscow , it also has an additional political value .
ankara intent to take over the western world &apos;s weak response was anger .
in addition , ankara &apos;s accession to the eu for the slow progress of negotiations and vladimir putin &apos;s hand in frustration over a long period of time , mr putin is keen to use political chill , and to weaken the relationship between turkey and the western world .
as a result of the election authorities to embrace after the failed coup , the russian leader will receive credit for ankara .
note that this has been for regime change in moscow have deep-seated fear is a gift .
so , on this golden seaside palace to meet held by russia and turkey are two western world state in denial and abuse ally , one analyst describes it as &quot; like a fish out of water union . &quot;
however , despite public reconciliation , but there are still significant differences between the two sides .
syria is a key factor . moscow has played the role of peacemaker in syria , while russia and turkey , but support for the opposing factions .
the foreseeable that , after nearly three hours of preliminary talks , the two presidents said at the press conference , has yet to talk about that subject .
turkish president avoided questions about the differences between the parties , and putin is highlighted .
both sides on how to find common ground on syria is not a clear consensus .
members of the north atlantic treaty organization , turkey shot down russian warplanes brought about by the months of open hostilities and raised the possibility of large-scale disasters , the two leaders to resume dialogue again is definitely a good thing .
royal bank of scotland will no longer be outside scotland for customer service
according to royal bank of scotland chief executive revealed that banks would be reduced to a logistics sector .
royal bank of scotland will no longer be for customers outside of scotland service .
ross mcewan told bbc scotland division , royal bank of scotland brand has committed to its global ambitions .
but eight years ago , on the verge of collapse and had to accept help from then on she gave up that kind of pursuit .
during that time , a brand strategist , using &quot; rbs &quot; to protect other consumer financial brand .
group had spent millions of pounds in sponsorship of six nations rugby match and cool , a tennis champion andy murray sponsorship of international sporting events .
but now , the right approach was to make it more of a national brand coming to the forefront .
royal bank of scotland customers will be used for scotland , but won &apos;t be able to respond as they are .
in england and wales , all outside the headquarters and stock exchange will change the reference to the national westminster bank .
ulster bank has been used for brand of the autonomous republic of ireland and northern ireland customers .
there are also some other , more prominent smaller private banks gu zi brands , such as banks , adam &amp; co , drummond and holt &apos;s military bank .
mr mcewen was at inverness county customer and employee visited the tour in an interview .
he told bbc scotland division , said : &quot; the royal bank of scotland brand will eventually become our investors brand , as well as staff employed brand one , because there is a wider sense we have become a large brand bank . &quot;
as the bank itself has become an international brand , rbs has become a global brand .
currently , i &apos;m saying is that we no longer focus on global , we have turned their sights to itself .
each brand to represent their respective industry is different , and our employees through different brand for customer service .
royal bank of scotland has suggested it would not continue to sponsor six national championships ; at the same time , there have been efforts to improve different brands in sports sponsorship image .
the chief executive said : &quot; it is time to become a more brand bank at the time , because in private , we have been exploring how to become a better service to the customer &apos;s bank . &quot;
three years ago if we aspire to be one of the many brands owned by the big banks will be ridiculed .
now we focus on customer needs , and i &apos;m sure you have noticed the change .
i think we can reboot the brand , but it &apos;s a good fit .

russian president vladimir putin lifted his chief of staff sergei ivanov
russian president vladimir putin ( vladimir putin ) unexpectedly lifted the sergei ivanov ( sergei ivanov ) presidential chief of staff position .
over the years , mr. ivanov , mr putin has been at the heart of trust by a group of terrorists .
ivanov , who is 63 years old today , has been appointed as special representative for environment and transport .
according to a statement from the kremlin , mr putin had &quot; declared the ivanov , director of the office of the president of russia , a position , &quot; but did not give a reason .
mr. ivanov in 2012 was appointed deputy anton wa yinuo ( anton vaino ) has been appointed as his successor .
mr. wa yinuo aged 44 , is a former diplomat .
he was born in 1972 in estonian capital tallinn , a graduate of the prestigious moscow state institute of international relations ( mgimo ) , the embassy in tokyo said .
later , he was president of management and government employees , the kremlin &apos;s web site ( using russian ) said .
since his appointment , he told mr. putin , said : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
i think this government &apos;s most important task is to support the head of state in drafting legislation and control commands to implement .
mr. putin told russian television on friday , said mr. ivanov submitted his resignation and recommended mr. wa yinuo to take over as their own .
so smile convincing to you ?
moscow was puzzled by this move .
sergei ivanov , has long been one of putin &apos;s closest aides , with vladimir putin , as well as in the soviet union had worked security ( kgb ) .
as the chief of staff , he was one of the country one of the most influential people .
state television broadcast in a meeting with russian president vladimir putin will be on the surface , two people alleged to be the chief of staff to resign on his own request .
although she was all smiles in front of the camera , but hardly convincing - - particularly in parliament before the election this time .
so , this is a lost cause in the fight for power , aren &apos;t they ?
not yet known .
however , the official story - a presidential candidate once considered a candidate to choose russia suddenly at the helm of environmental policy - attracted many doubts .
the kremlin website quoted mr. ivanov dialogue with mr. putin , he said : &quot; yes , in early 2012 , i worked in a conversation asking you to be this difficult position , and could even be said to be in trouble with the post , four years in office . &quot;
&quot; as a result , i have served as the director general of the office of four years eight months now . &quot;
mr. ivanov , to the post in december 2011 .
previously , he served as deputy prime minister and minister of defence .
he is a member of the russian security council , also told mr putin , and is also a former member of the national security agency .
the late 1990s , when mr. putin as a federal security service ( fsb , formerly the national security agency ) , the secretary for mr. ivanov was appointed his deputy .
after mr. putin came to power , he appointed mr. ivanov is one of the five people he trusted most .
outside once considered mr. ivanov , mr. putin could be in for a second term as president after the end of the third term , which is a violation of the constitution .
but the job ultimately belong to another close putin aide dmitry medvedev ( dmitry medvedev ) .
in three and a half years after the restart , before serving as president , mr. putin , the russian prime minister .

the engineers have already put kvinsferri ( queensferry crossing ) bridge in northbridge in the face and viaducts that connect them together now leads unto bridge to fife .
it is located near the bridge around three a bridgehead &quot; deck fan &quot; closure is nearing completion of the project , which led to the closure of a bridge .
the bridge started in fife 600 metres long , weigh 30,000 tonnes .
it employs 10,000 tonnes of steel , 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 root of cable .
the £ 1,350,000,000 cost of the project is planned to be completed in may 2017 .
economy minister keith brown ( keith brown ) visited the site today , becoming the first boarded one of the bridge .
he said : &quot; this is kvinsferri in bridge construction in the course of a historic moment . &quot;
we have embarked on a project so ambitious in engineering work , the construction of the bridge , which was used for a period of more than 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel .
despite the size and weight of the bridge , but were very huge viaduct and completion of the bridge closure between the delicate operation was required , need to be very precise assembly .
overall , nearly 79 per cent of the total bridge has now been installed , the final paragraph of the bridge deck is pouring concrete in rosyth today , which means that all the deck had been well located as it is ready .
in kvinsferri bridge construction company project director michael martin said : &quot; whatever the bridge project , the first closure of a major milestone . &quot;
on this great project , this time showing the closure of civil engineering at the forefront of technology .
the last part of the way and will be connected to the expanded panel of northbridge fort - the road of the panel , then there needs to be done on land or close to the north side of the remaining gap closure .
to complete the task required the north approach viaduct south of 700 millimetres .
this is a massive job , at the same time , it &apos;s a very sophisticated operation .
said its magnitude was because viaduct 222 metres long and weighs about 6,000 tonnes , need to pull up a roughly 3 per cent gradient .
it is precisely because the team needs to ensure it &apos;s a very small deviations , each side has only a few millimetres .
it is comforting to know that everything went smoothly .

byers free gymnastics of a paragraph - - including her trademark somersaults threaded a piece of that , with a latin music , and the music is with her at the rio olympic stadium only a house across the street to listen to .
it &apos;s no coincidence .

she &apos;s free after blowing a kiss to the crowd of gymnastics , announcing the return of return , but before that , and sometimes it looks like there is some doubt about it .
beiers-cai 19 years old. from earlier in the week , its message on twitter to spread like a virus . it bayerce , his life has been given a new meaning .
&quot; several times in the upper body &quot; at the age of 6 in philadelphia mahaj brown survived the shooting .

the child &apos;s grandparents told cbs philadelphia that kids are being shot mahaj brown .
they said that brown &apos;s groin , leg , arm and stomach and other sites with multiple gunshot wounds in the hospital , but the kids are on their way to a sober .
&quot; he &apos;s been a lot of crime , little body was shot full of holes , &quot; his grandmother delores melendez said the tv station .
i couldn &apos;t believe it .
the boy in hospital in critical condition , had been receiving several surgeries .

on tuesday , and a six year-old children ( girls ) , based in the west oak lane neighborhood playing outside their home when they were shot in the arm by a stray bullet .
she is now recovering , and the police are still hunting the suspects .
why do we need to have simon , gabriel and laurie .
i just say this year &apos;s women &apos;s olympic team , and more than one reason .
first of all , since 1984 , i went to every summer olympics , but the united states has held such dominance .
secondly , a gymnastics team have three elite gymnasts - simon byers ( simone biles ) , gabriel douglas ( gabby douglas ) and laurie hernandez ( lauren laurie hernandez ) , who has been an inspiration to many colored girl .
the composition of this contingent makes everyone feel proud , because it contains a jewish ali riceman ( aly raisman ) and catholic madison keshan ( madison kocian ) .
the team finally looks like the american contingent .
it also cemented black and hispanic women in the sport &apos;s top position .
over the past four years , leading female gymnasts have been african-american .
last year , simon and gabriel breakdown first and second .
that &apos;s amazing .
the previous olympic , gabriel douglas &quot; surprising &quot; to become olympic champion , which was hailed by the united states .
today , the whole world can witness three world champion simon byers , douglas and laurie hernandez a wonderful performance . they get regular gymnastic skills played superbly .
on thursday , simon to help the us team at the women &apos;s individual all-around project for four years .
her teammate ali riceman won a silver medal .
we climbed to the top of the sport , but across america teaching gymnastics class does not .
simon , gabriel and laurie entered the olympic team with ali and madison avenues as well .
they are &quot; the ultimate in five groups of people &quot; ( final five ) , because the next olympic gymnastics team will consist of four members of the gymnasts is marta karoly takai coached last year .
but the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport , gymnast mainly in private gymnastics club for their training , their parents need to pay for training , facilities , travel , clothing , games and hotel costs ( including coaches and gymnasts and their associated costs ) , and the growing list of expenses .
most of the gymnastics club is located in support for the industry &apos;s affluent suburbs .
all the gymnasts have completed training in these clubs , the gymnast households is a long-term high expenses .
byers coach aimee burman ( aimee boorman ) and hernandez &apos;s coach maggie haney , since the two gymnasts who switched to gymnastics , which has been coaching them .
we must be more affordable , more accessible gymnastics training brings countless plagued by simon , gabriel and laurie effect on young girls .
twenty years ago , i have set up their own gymnastics foundation .
in my organization in harlem , where we were more than 15,000 to urban youth ( mostly black and hispanic ) to provide free , cheap gymnastics , and develop a national and world championships .
in september , we will expand to detroit ( my hometown ) , to those who deserve the opportunity to learn from this and will be of great benefit to the olympic movement of young people with high-quality gymnastics .
exercise helps build physical strength , flexibility and coordination , and also help foster a spirit of hard work , self-discipline and commitment .
these can be a person &apos;s health , education and job benefits for lifelong success .
inspired by this army contingent , tens of thousands of young girls will learn gymnastics , it &apos;s really good .
participation in sport is significant , particularly for girls .
this is an exciting time .
thanks to simon , ali , laurie , gabriellegyptian madison won the olympic gold medal in the course of the show a &quot; girl power &quot; , and thanks to their inspired so many young girls from different backgrounds to open a healthy , strong , the path to success .

companies now in order to protect its interests , and increased pollution , to cherish the enthusiasm of a limited number of emissions , reduce the emission of pollutants .
with the economic interests of the drive to reduce the emission of pollutants from government coercion into business conscious market behaviour , so as to achieve a real protection of the environment , nature conservation , protection of public health purposes .
emission also referred to as the &quot; emissions &quot; is the right to emit pollutants emitters , refers to the amount allocated by the government , to have the right to emit pollutants into the environment .
this right is essentially the discharger environmental capacity resources , use and possession of proceeds of the rights .
the next step , the total emissions of pollutants than allowed under the precondition of emissions from sources within the currency exchange between the amount of sewage transfers between the way .
emission trading since 1968 by the united states since the dales , an economist in the 1970s , the united states began applying it to the management of air and water pollution .

china &apos;s mars plan here .
china wants a mars mission to achieve orbit and landing , the form , which has been in a foreign country .
our goal is to launch exploration of mars to step around , landing , visiting , this task has been particularly challenging .
because mars probe to 26 months in order to meet a time window , so experts are working closely to develop projects in 2020 , the window for me to launch its first mars probe .
according to xu dazhe said although the spacecraft has entered into deep space , but completed a mars mission to mars is indispensable , means china is truly entering the era of deep space exploration .
&quot; every two years or three years , just one time , mars , earth &apos;s most recent opportunities , at this point in time to launch mars probe , the rocket is the most provincial energy . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the mars probe &apos;s quality , it would be up to our long march five of rocket launches to complete . &quot;
china wants a mars mission to achieve orbit , landed , visits abroad , a form that is never , ever , to have been abroad for a time around and landing , but landing failed .
mars probe relates to so many of the technical areas , special branch also lies in the fact that while the rover is a space probe , but compared with the general space probes , it also has its own distinctive characteristics .
in other words , the mars rover to identify a driving route , found dangerous obstacles to capacity .
china aerospace science and technology group five , pang zhihao , a researcher at the institute of human beings to mars so fascinating , because mars has important science , technology , and even more significance in relation to the future of humanity .
today mars has become a human research , other than on earth , where the highest levels of the planets , and use of human space exploration of mars probes of almost throughout human history is heading .
as a result , the humans to mars in the hope of one day building residential base , ultimately to mars immigrants , to turn it into people &apos;s second homes .
plenty of evidence also suggests that mars used to be possible with the current planet over billions of years , just like the evolution of the atmosphere , they become thinner , lower temperatures , water depletion might look like .
as a result , or manned mars probe to conduct research into the earth , to prevent human to survive the two made plans for mars .
as of june 2016 , the global times carried out a total of 114 , 43 times for lunar exploration exploration of mars .
however , from the 1990s , has conducted a total of 18 times human exploration of mars and the moon probe carried out only 14 times .
there are currently five mars orbiters and two rovers on mars are in work , but only one moon orbiter and a lander on the moon is at work .
space world powers are prepared to mars exploration program targeting system , suggesting that today &apos;s mars probe is hotter than the moon .
5 november 2013 , india launched its first mars probe &quot; manchester garrian &quot; to become the first asian country to mars exploration success .
&quot; gary &apos;s ann &quot; are used to study martian surface features , minerals , atmosphere and explore mars for methane and signs of life .
the hardest part of this mission is to probe entered the martian atmosphere and parachutes down aerodynamic shape after only get one chance .
according to the china aerospace science and technology corporation five houses in general device chief designer of sun zezhou mars probe , the mars mission is facing a number of technical challenges .
mars &apos; atmospheric pressure on earth &apos;s surface is very low , with only 1 per cent of the atmospheric pressure , which has a very high level of uncertainty .
it &apos;s about change and when factors such as storm characteristics , scientists haven &apos;t yet poorly understood .
in the summer , often forming planet similar to earth of the dust storms , which could lead to a rover received a sharp decline in the sunlight , it is important for the rover is designed to &quot; sleep &quot; mode that lets its waited patiently for the storms of the past .
at the same time , the sun shone on the martian atmosphere as well as reduce the role of energy supply for the mars exploration brings challenges .
this will require a much larger solar covered detectors , and need constant adjustments to the direction of the sun .
the surface of mars , and only 38 % of earth &apos;s gravity , but better than most of the surface of the moon &apos;s gravity , so the probe needs more power .
&quot; this mars mission to the core , the hardest part is to probe entered the martian atmosphere and aerodynamics and parachute to slow down the process , have only one chance to ensure success . &quot;
sun zezhou said , because of the distance between earth and mars , the whole process is not far from the surface real-time control , so they must rely on independent probe is completed .
in the absence of so many propellant to offset such high speeds , so mars , slow down when you want to rely on the role of the martian atmosphere , but if it is difficult to simulate the martian atmosphere .
pang zhihao , overall , mars probe to the moon with the way the way , is similar to &quot; around , left , rangers are back , &quot; and , ultimately , the goal of a manned mission to mars .
because of the distance from earth to mars to the earth than the moon is much farther away , so mars will need to conquer a more complicated set of technical difficulties .

and yet , in the 50m freestyle heats , ning zetao once again to refresh people &apos;s &quot; bottom line &quot; .
it is not the 50 meters freestyle ning zetao , his world championships in kazan and the performance of the best achievements , as well as his decision on the project is not likely to make a breakthrough .
sure enough , hong kong media authority ta kung pao said ning zetao defeat , the biggest reason is simply that he has lost interest in the swim .
many outside factors that may affect his ideas for the future , he has had a significant impact on the entertainment industry are now more likely to be interested .
the kazan world championships , ning zetao , with its high value yang and good grades , and instantly become a network of red .
as a result , &quot; the husband &quot; or &quot; little fresh meat , &quot; &quot; flower boy &quot; also continue to be addressed , such as on his label .
looking for a variety of commercial activities , the better the money started to become a gold , shimmering avenue .
in this case , ning zetao even choose to retire in the entertainment industry , it is not just his freedom , is also a plausible path .
after all , he &apos;s only 23 years of age , a certain amount of learning , it can be in popularity , with its 12 drama .
ning zetao , however , need to look at ourselves and compared these predecessors , aren &apos;t enough qualified ?
the 2000 sydney olympics , it has been 21 years , liu xuan of athletes have come to the end of his career .
liu xuan appearance makes her pretty quickly , be remembered for her next foray into the entertainment industry foundation .
after retiring , liu xuan appeared in many tv series in 2013 , and set up his own studio .
tian participated in the two games were a pair of ten metres a game , and earned two gold , two silver .
but at the 2004 games single ten metres a game after losing to teammate hu jia tian , a dip in form , and was expelled by the diving team .
but he and his daughter attend the &quot; where &apos;s dad &quot; variety show , such as more is to get him to the pockets of the eyeball .
former gymnastics gold generation , li wei and chen yibing are high-profile participated in a variety of arts programs .
it &apos;s worth noting at the time , li wei , china &apos;s leading champion men &apos;s team for the 2008 games is two times more wei , the individual all-around gold medal , known as all-powerful king .
but chen yibing , led by the chinese to get the 2012 olympic team title at the same time , it also became the king &apos;s rings .
at the london olympics but suffered a miscarriage and lost the gold medal later , chen yibing magnanimous gesture also lets him countless li fen .
but the main focus of the current players still out on the field , for a variety show is just a touch - - - - - - - - - - - - - - such as make it go away .
but either retired or active athletes , will be favored in the entertainment industry needs to be done to safeguard presentable results .
after all , athletes to move into a new realm , whether capacity or relationships , is a blank .
even tian , liu xuan entertainment spent so many years of &quot; the old man , &quot; a general audience , the more they thought of their performance at the olympics .
wei , li xiaopeng and newcomer , such as the introduction of the variety show appearances , no exceptions are &quot; olympic champion &quot; .
compared to the previous one , ning zetao a swimming world champion &apos;s reputation is still thin .
what &apos;s more , compared to tian , liu xuan wei , et al . , ning zetao who retired at the age of 23 , in a career setback would retire , the negative impact of the image may be immeasurable .
after all , about athletes , people &apos;s claims are &quot; don &apos;t ask victorious , but please , not afraid of hard , &quot; ning zetao distance it was missed by a lot .
at the very least , ning zetao handsome , can completely rely on face value if it received the support of the cerebral residual powder .
no little skill on appearances , only to succeed in the entertainment industry , it is good to mix this difficulty is not due back to training so hard , was it a state .
life is all a matter of personal choice , but how to choose , ning zetao know it .

&quot; the social network with low costs , transmission speed , many people at the same time sharing features , to meet the needs of contemporary college students . &quot;
expanding relationships more equal dialogue , and to avoid social concerns , we are increasingly a deep love of the main reasons for the online chat .
upon joining the company &apos;s new love online exchanges with colleagues , &quot; because to get into units you don &apos;t really know , through the social networking platform it is similar comments , relations are much closer than before . &quot;
love is also commonly used to make friends online exchanges , &quot; before talking to friends as some sort of misunderstanding , there was a time when no contact , and later , in a large house first dialogue a few words to warm again . &quot;
it engineer wu yan depth is social networking enthusiast , he has spent most of his social life online , network contacts took place in more than a few times in your circle of friends .
wu yan himself admits the network more &quot; like a duck to water . &quot;
&quot; it can be at their own convenience wants time to reply to a friend , because there are a lot of discretion to sentence time , presentation will also be able to more clearly . &quot;
&quot; hidden in the id under the umbrella of the letters to avoid face-to-face interpersonal impact , not only has room for manoeuvre , even gave each other more thought and time and space . &quot;
&quot; people of different identities have the same right to speak and efficiency in real life , the social concerns that in cyberspace seemed to have it removed . &quot;
however wu yan friend peng , but feel that life is a wu yan &quot; pretty boring guy &quot; .
peng and wu yan in a large groups met in person , because both are active speakers , it soon became familiar with each other up .
think wu yan peng told the network two quite different people , words are boring and don &apos;t offer comment , again and again just a few words , &quot; oh , good , is it ? &quot; , to not just be &quot; oh , i want to check online to see if &quot; .

the chinese sports also have such a group of stars coach : they &apos;re athletes , high-flying era for countries to win numerous glory ; the retired after teaching at the school , cultivate a latecomer to win the championship .
as china &apos;s first male gymnastics world champion , juan yubin took up after retirement pointer .
men from the women &apos;s team coach , coach to head coach , juan yubin has built an &quot; olympic gold mission &quot; in the olympic team , but made nine gold , 1 silver and four bronze myth of record .
since then , tian has been constantly advertising campaigns in recent years , especially as a &quot; cowboy &quot; and &quot; lei feng &quot; and other important roles .
many nba players have to prove himself . but some progress is one of decline .
whether it &apos;s because of the age increase or playing time is limited , and each season has a number of players will show a decline .
of course , some &quot; regressive &quot; may simply be data shrink , these players may not have the strength of the decline .
even though wade is still in the league &apos;s best point guard , but he was one of the bull &apos;s performance should not have heat and so good .
he and rajon rondo of the back of their limited range of stars , butler hit three points and only 32.8 per cent , which let them attack next season will be getting pretty crowded .
came to the windy city , and the flash is bound to get the ball more to butler and rajon rondo , and their health is likely to be selected in the regular season play .
okafor is more awkward as 76 people last season , his first choice for the new season and own bidet and simmons had to compete for playing time and ball .
this competition could not come soon , simmons will also need to adapt to the nba game , which also own bidet as soon as possible to fully recover from the injury , but okafor 76 people will be in the position of the longer there is still a problem .
last season , okafor scored from the low of 32 per cent to attack , that a higher proportion than cousins , vučje vicky and brook lopez , and his former union rates also topped 40 .
as simmons has demonstrated a good ball striker , also has the potential to own bidet nba game more suited to the status of the figure , okafor hardly so secure .
over the past two season , thompson has stabilized the use of the top 20 in the league , and this is the best of his career last season two .
but again , the question is , with the arrival of durant and thompson usage will be reduced , which will affect his play .
this influence will not only be a number of shots of the impact of the attack with the ball , tang god sure next season will also be significantly reduced , in some respects it would also reduce opponents to his defense more difficult .
durant &apos;s arrival will make the braves players data shrink , but the decline is probably the most serious of the thompson .
but that doesn &apos;t mean tang god levels decline , it &apos;s more like he made a sacrifice for the team as a whole .
parker has fared better in the last season to be better reflected in the data , not only because of his basketball career , came to the efficiency of the chemistry he and aldridge also allowed the spurs to benefit .
veterans tim duncan , manu ginobili and announced a further war combination of gdp a year , will eventually come to an end , as one of three men , one of the youngest french sports car nor much in the tank of gas .
in the third championship ring after only abdul-jabbar , michael jordan and russell than james to win more of the regular season mvp , and jordan is the only one f.m.v.p. more people than james .
oh , yes , james has just brought in cleveland the past 52 years , the very first professional sports championship trophy .
his career came in the 14th season of james needs to better ensure physical , ready for the playoffs .
therefore , in the regular season , james &apos;s data is likely to fall further , and he &apos;ll get more of the heavy lifting to owen to bear , but he could still easily be three former league player .

he was not under the influence is very important indeed .
we have a very good start , but we &apos;re not looking forward to doing that great things .
we don &apos;t have to think about today &apos;s glory , we just want to make every single sculls and win the game , and we did .
the pair spent a year to determine their own future .
graf will next month with tv adventure member steve barkerschal marriage .

snapchat &apos;s &quot; anime &quot; effect , which was ironic asians
snapchat said the filter is inspired by the anime , but some observers believe it has racial overtones .
snapchat 150,000,000 name daily mirror jay tool allows users to change reality and would like to become ridiculous .
you can put yourself into a pineapple , a dog or a roy lichtensteinic roles .
the lens is curved , blunting the effect of the feature , and every day to produce 3,000 more than one million piece of polished selfie .
any mistake will now be the public attention .
snapchat lens had been subjected to criticism , the application was a play inspired by black or white skin for beauty .
thus , when the application for some users this week provides a can create strabismus , blame the tooth and powder filter effects , some critics have dubbed it the asian &quot; yellow &quot; racial satire .
they even think of these recurring question of whether that means the company &apos;s diversity is a big problem .
in the snapchat said its removal of the feature on wednesday after the verge and motherboard reports have sparked outrage .
the company &apos;s explanation is : the filter to pay tribute to the comic roles , rather than satirical asians .
but for the experienced racism in the observer , which reminded them of the filter with the reality of the harmful stereotypes .
others have strongly objected to the cartoon character .
one of these photographs published on twitter and has been widely shared in a korean american art said in an email that these filters &quot; at least was a source of pain and discomfort . &quot;
she also said : &quot; it &apos;s hard to distinguish between extreme nausea asian satirical image and filter results . &quot;
it &apos;s not just the mirror though ay yellow , but yellow is extremely underrated .
snapchat isn &apos;t the only one to reach the finish line of the culture company .
the company &apos;s board of directors from hollywood and the devices we carry , appears to have been in american culture to promote diversity and inclusion .
a large group of young because snapchat than the older generation is more focused on racial diversity and , therefore , may be very sensitive .
when a snapchat filter produced an insult to the user &apos;s image , the 25-year-old zhu kaidi ( unc ) in thursday &apos;s interview , said : &quot; compared to the previous , such things harder to escape attention . &quot;
on thursday , in the medium as a product manager and engineer zhu had decided to remove her snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same .
in an article for medium has written articles and a telephone interview , she said she believes the controversy over racism in snapchat reflect the lack of racial diversity in the recruitment process .
ms. zhu , criticized the company &apos;s employees , mostly white , male and all the leadership at the end of the article with a label : # deletesnapchat .
as a chinese american , ms chu said : &quot; either they employees in the absence of a variety of races , so we can make that decision , or their staff in a number of coloured , but their job is not to allow them to speak freely . &quot;
other observers have not been shared her snapchat responds to complaints .
the company does not release data on the diversity of employees , and says he is a private company .
on thursday , snapchat declined to discuss their employee &apos;s racial background , but a spokesman said the company recently hired a recruiter within focusing specifically on a relatively low percentage of people inside , as well as promoting inclusive work .
ms chu said she would close her snapchat account : &quot; i want to know whether they need to be more like we did against this behaviour of users . &quot;
congressional panel that military officials have skewed intelligence on isis
a congressional panel on thursday , according to the report , released by the u. s. central command officials changed the intelligence reports , the fight against islamic state in iraq and syria , describing the war situation than they actually are more optimistic .
this interim report from a military commission , by the house of representatives intelligence committee and the house of representatives appropriations committee &apos;s defense subcommittee chairman of the republican party to form a special working group . reports that centcom intelligence analysts there exists &quot; a wide range of grievances , &quot; the analysts said they were at a higher level of tampering with the united states and the islamic state &apos;s assessment of the battle .
located in tampa , florida &apos;s central command ( centcom ) is responsible for the supervision of the united states is in the middle east and central parts of the military headquarters of military operations .
according to a report on news of the report , &quot; the central command senior leaders to review intelligence for the u. s. counter-terrorism operations description than it really is more optimistic , and has been compared to other intelligence agency &apos;s analysis is more optimistic . &quot;
california republican representative said : &quot; the central command &apos;s behaviour is unacceptable . our fighters on one side is war-weary , on the other side were the top policy makers received the wrong analysis . &quot;
the leadership of the central command issues have been extended to the bodies at the highest level .
the report details a 2014-2015 description and analysis of the central command in the united states training the iraqi army has long-standing problems .
although there was no definitive evidence that the obama administration &apos;s top officials ordered changes to those reports , but according to a description of the report , these analysts feel under pressure from central command leader , forcing them to pressure the islamic state ( isis or isil ) threat issued a more optimistic view .
the report said that &quot; in the first half of 2015 , many of the central command &apos;s press release , statements and testimony to congress than it actually was much too optimistic . &quot;
for example , a central command officials say it could open as early as april or may 2015 , a large-scale military operation to retake mosul .
iraq &apos;s second largest city of mosul remains under the control of the islamic state .
kansas republican rep. mike pompo said in a statement . &quot; after months of investigation , the results have been very clear . &quot;
since mid- 2015 to mid- 2014 , the u. s. central command &apos;s most senior intelligence officials to manipulate the headquarters of the intelligence product , concealing the threat of the islamic state of iraq .
republicans had learned from the analyst on intelligence on the islamic state are being manipulated , and set up a special working group .
as the investigation continues , after this thursday &apos;s release of the report found that there will be many more .
the ministry of defence and the attorney general &apos;s office for the central command investigation for a long time .
members of the house intelligence committee democrats announced on thursday the results of its investigation , and the republican party dedicated to some of the conclusions of the working group to be consistent .
the committee democrat xie anda representative said in a statement . during 2014-2015 , the central command for the islamic state and iraqi security forces intelligence assessment has developed a process that is too narrow . &quot;
mr. xie anda said the process &quot; inhibits the release of information , &quot; reducing the analyst &apos;s morale and &quot; unable to accept different points of view . &quot;
but mr. xie anda and democrats have also said they found no evidence to prove that the white house of trying to pressure of centcom analysts , thus , their conclusion is consistent with &quot; the default or political narrative . &quot;
&apos;the beast daily reports to congress on tuesday , the preliminary results of the survey .
eight months of last year , the new york times reports the centcom analysts after receiving complaints from the pentagon after the attorney general &apos;s office began an investigation .
pentagon spokesman lieutenant commander patrick evans said in a statement that the attorney general &apos;s investigation is not completed before the end of this parliament to the ministry of defence does not comment on that report .

jean zigman said : &quot; this is for the food , and are people suffering through thick and thin . &quot;
her husband , andrew ko bu chong said : &quot; it is a sign of the american way of eating . &quot;
the couple , who live in brooklyn heights couple is a food historian .
mr. k &apos;s previous book , the chop suey &apos; is about american chinese food , and ms. zigman in her &apos; 97 orchard book tells the story of food through the slums rented geek &apos;s life story .
together , they write in the new book , a big meal , to be published by harper on tuesday , the book is the great depression , the american food history .
on display in a number of food when they share a common vision in the author &apos;s sandwich shop in encounter with a journalist . this is a simple lunch counters in the flatiron district since 1929 , when economic ben collapse , which has been open until now .
at the age of 54 , ms. zigman ordered a cream cheese sandwiches with chopped olives and the 57-year-old mr. k point turkey , mashed potatoes and a vegetable platter .
reporter ordered a meatloaf , the couple believe that these dishes suitable for discussion during the great depression to the diet .
ms. zigman said : &quot; when the bread is very popular . &quot;
then there are peanuts , soy , liver bread loaf of bread .
they are a kind of raw materials and a range of cheap raw materials to pour over the toppings are made .
imagine your dinner is peanuts .
mr. k pulls a face .
he said : &quot; it &apos;s in your stomach would certainly like to lead it . &quot;
the crash happened a few years ago , americans were buffet fife , especially in the suburbs .
a group of women for male workers farm , cook breakfast , lunch and dinner have test simply out of the pie .
in the first world war , it is the americans will be food for the hungry europeans . &apos; a big meal , has a record of how the country is suddenly no longer be a richer place .
mr. section explains why he and his wife to write this book : &quot; at the time , food has become a americans feel about the main topic of conversation . &quot;
another unpleasant topic is shabby new food : bread and stews such as &quot; food fans &quot; has become the main course , stew is &quot; the best way to cook food , &quot; says ms zigman , this is because the chefs of the cream sauce can be used to cover up bad ingredients .
fresh fruit is cheap dried fruit instead .
over the years has been starring on the dining table in american meat has become a rare luxury .
strange mishmash of calories , compared to only consider taste and even basic cooking knowledge , it is the first consideration is nutrition .
in the book , including a variety of recipes , in the process of ms. zigman made a peanut butter stuffed baked onions .
mr. k said : &quot; at the dinner table is not common . &quot;
ms. zigman said : &quot; this is so weird . &quot;
peanut oil and grilled onions , simply cannot match .
this is a feature of many family meals .
economists affects the families of this country &apos;s eating habits , such as a 1923-1943 economic services for the families of chef louis stanley et al , it is the only one of its kind in history .
they were published in newspapers and magazines and articles , recipes , and encourage women to be &quot; prudent &quot; and creamy tagliatelle with carrots and other bad food into food .
&apos;a big meal is a hearty &quot; historical subtleties . &quot;
particularly interesting is the public hunger for the government &apos;s response to the public , for example , president herbert hoover &quot; someone else , i don &apos;t care about the &quot; attitude .
although he publicly praised the simple childhood iowa farmhouse , but his diet is like general was exquisite .
section , said : &quot; he likes to eat european food , such as fish sauce with huang gua . &quot;
he was wearing an evening gown , in a gilded dining in the restaurant .
he was obviously out of people .
if it wasn &apos;t his wife elinor , encouraged him to set an example on the diet , president roosevelt could make the same mistake .
as the book , as they were recruited by roosevelt , butler for a taste of no interest , so the white house &quot; food is not only washington , d. c. , the hardest thing to eat is to cook the worst food . &quot;
when a us back on track , and many of the depression cooking style is to be abandoned .
ms. zigman says , is that we have to focus on calories and nutrition and the use of science to cooking .
the couple said in writing this book , they learn more about the ms. zigman mother &apos;s eating habits , such as how she didn &apos;t put the food away .
mr. k said : &quot; she was very afraid of food waste . &quot;
ms. zigman recalls : &quot; she actually makes many people sick . &quot;
for example , has had a &quot; cream puff &quot; events together .
after removing the plates , she and mr. k took out their home for a dessert : this is the president roosevelt in lunch to eat fruit pudding .
ms. zigman said : &quot; it &apos;s called cream , fruit , &quot; and added to an ordinary dish into a trendy name is &quot; favourite trick . &quot;
the dessert is not the only fruit , whipped cream and a little flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
people are reluctant to put a spoon into the sticky brown paste .
surprisingly , the dessert tastes good .
mr. k and eat a second spoonful , the three spoonfuls .
he thought it was acceptable for a great dessert , he told his wife : &quot; add some chopped walnuts will taste better . &quot;

in recent years in china capacity utilization rate is higher than the global average and higher than both the us and europe and other countries and regions .
we have to take strong and effective measures to resolve of excess capacity and effectiveness is gradually revealed .

all sectors and regions of the state council to actively implement the deployment to work seriously to yajian , crude steel production capacity this year 45 million tonnes .
from our conditions , and we do not encourage steel exports , on the contrary , has also taken a series of concrete measures to control steel exports .

and we will be in the vicinity of heathrow through the local people and businesses to create opportunities for the benefit of the region .
only with respect to our local communities are concerned , we will create 10,000 new apprenticeship positions , 40,000 new jobs and enable the airport around young people out of unemployment woes .
as the london 2012 olympic games , with some arguing that heathrow expansion project is too big .
i was told that the uk will not be able to prepare for the games , and we would lose face in the world .
for the 2012 olympics sceptic doubt is wrong , and they are also suspected of heathrow projects will be proved wrong .
while there will always be obstacles to overcome , but heathrow is to solve every problem facing .
like the olympics , heathrow is for most people , rather than by a few people to carry out infrastructure projects .
expansion project will create up to 180,000 new jobs , with £ 211,000,000,000 of economic growth , the uk and around the airport to leave a big technology and employment , wealth .
we have an excellent heathrow project team . the team was on time and within budget completed a £ 11,000,000,000 investment in infrastructure projects , including five consecutive year elected the world &apos;s best airport terminal and at terminal 5 in the world &apos;s busiest runways between two of the t2 terminal .
now , they are prepared to £ 16,000,000,000 of private investment to build a third runway .
the uk successfully hosted the 2012 london olympics , and i am confident that heathrow airport expansion project will also be a great success .
now it is we &apos;re passing the olympic spirit and expansion of heathrow airport in good time , so that we can for our future escort and create a lot of money to make the uk proud technology and employment , wealth .

nasa climate models : venus was fit for human habitation
according to nasa &apos;s new climate model projections , venus was unfit for human habitation .
nasa goddard institute for space studies scientist has developed a could explore venus , the last of the models , which use tools and algorithms and climate scientists are using very similar .
the model used to determine the surface water temperature , carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of venus , and whether there were similar to earth &apos;s environment .
previously , scientists believed that venus spins slower because of its thick atmosphere .
but the latest simulation shows that venus may have been a relatively thin , similar to the earth &apos;s atmosphere and then spin similarly slow .
the model also shows early venus terrain .
venus in the dry area might have more than the earth , but it has enough water to breed and geographical changes lives and prevent rapid evaporation .
on venus , early exposure to the sun than the earth &apos;s surface brightness of 30 per cent .
goddard institute for space studies scientist anthony del zhioo explained in a press release : &quot; the goddard institute for space studies model simulations , the venus slow rotation to make their side of the daytime hours for nearly two months . &quot;
this causes the surface warming and had to be able to form a thick cloud of rain and thick clouds like an umbrella to block on the ground , as most of the heat from the sun .
the results of the simulation is an average temperature of the planet &apos;s climate is actually worse than a few degrees off the earth right now .
the model to simulate the evolution of venus , the planets before the scientists speculate that similar .
although life may have existed on mars , but in the course of a few billion years , venus is exposed to high levels of ultraviolet light and temperature .
the planet &apos;s oceans evaporate , water vapor also consumed by uv radiation .
with the escape of hydrogen , left the only thick carbon dioxide atmosphere and deadly greenhouse gas effect , thus forming the planet as we know it today .
researchers in the geophysical research letters journal , published in the new venus climate model simulations .

north sea oil workers to stop the strike to continue negotiations
chief negotiator , said north sea oil workers to stop on pay strike , this time the parties to the dispute began a new round of negotiations .
royal dutch shell &apos;s north sea oil platform , operated on there were a lot of time for oilfield services company wood group strikes .
according to a joint statement , &quot; wood group and unite and rmt unions can confirm we have agreed to restart the current dispute resolution process . &quot;
we will start early next week , in the next few weeks a number of meetings held throughout the day , to look at these issues .
the union said its recent action is in protest at the highest possible pay cuts of 30 per cent , and this is the first time in 25 years to take this action .
wood group this year because of market pressures and the north sea contractors pay reduced by approximately 9 per cent .
the pay cuts , the company in 2014 before the sea contractors pay has fallen by 10 per cent .
company says it will cut again to help companies survive through the market downturn .
shell has been reduced by thousands employees and announced plans to shut down oil and gas equipment in 10 countries , this is because the company british gas and british energy company merged group to streamline its business .
energy companies are facing a decline in crude oil prices from june , and the uk &apos;s brexit decision under pressure .
dave anderson , a member of the scottish parliament earlier in the week to meet with union leaders to discuss this generation in the north sea &apos;s biggest labour disputes .
he said the north sea is vital for the region &apos;s economy .
dave said in a statement : &quot; in the north sea and the country as a whole , we need a service in the majority , not minority economy . &quot;
in 2016 , the north sea spending on new projects not expected to exceed $ 1,400,000,000 , compared to an average of the past five years spending on projects to about $ 7,000,000,000 .
the kepler mission spin speed of stars .
the kepler space telescope &apos;s latest mission to help astronomers the most complete collection of the star &apos;s rotation speed .
new data is helping astronomers understand why the cluster of stars with different spin and spin cycle associated with the composition of the planet .
california institute of technology in pasadena infrared processing and analysis center , a research scientist at rebel lusatia , said at a news conference : &quot; we hope that by comparing our results and other clusters further understanding of stellar mass , age , and even its solar historical relationship . &quot;
the pleiades mission , 445 light-years away from earth .
many of the cluster stars are born in about 125,000,000 years ago , is still just reaching adulthood .
they reached a life in the most high rotation speed .
when the rotation rate of the highest , these mature stars shoot lots of stellar wind .
when these stellar wind through the star &apos;s magnetic field , they will be able to produce stars braking .
as stars age , their rotation speed begins to slow down .
kepler by tracking sunspots recognizable stars ( like sunspots ) the time to measure the spin speed of stars .
the latest rotation speed data sets show that high mass stars spin slower than the quality of the smaller star .
ray bull will star as a dancer , the bigger the dancer rotates slower than the smaller dancer .
ray bull said : &quot; the mission of the &quot; ballet performing &quot; we find that spin slower stars tend to high mass , and rotating the fastest stars tend to be the lightest stars . &quot;
due to the close proximity of the pleiades mission , so you can compare quality and stars as the ideal lab rotation rate of the universe .
ray bull said : &quot; the pleiades mission for young and old stars two-way rotation theoretical models for the future . &quot;
stars on how , when and why the slow rotation speed and &quot; put your shoes &quot; , we still have a lot of knowledge .
ray bull and her colleagues at three of the papers detailed their rotation speed for the pleiades in the latest analysis . soon the three papers will be published in the astronomical journal .
