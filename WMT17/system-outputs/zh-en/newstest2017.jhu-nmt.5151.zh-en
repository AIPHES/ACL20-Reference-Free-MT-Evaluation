primary doctors strike : call for new labor action
the primary doctor &apos;s representatives called on the alliance to approve new labour actions for new contractual disputes .
the committee of first doctors of the british medical association will require all its members to begin supporting more labour operations early in september .
the jmc indicated that the ministers had not resolved their concerns about the contract .
junior doctors and medical students voted in july to boycott contracts with the british medical association .
fifty-eight per cent of the members voting objected to the contract transaction .
in a letter addressed to twitter on thursday evening , the chairman of the junior medical board , ellen mccourt , said that the government had &quot; been silent &quot; about the resistance to the contract .
&quot; in view of this , the executive committee of the committee of first instance has voted to reject the proposed new contract and calls for renewed formal consultations on all concerns , &quot; she said .
in response to the government &apos;s silence , the executive committee of the committee of first doctors formally requested the council of british medical association to convene a special session of the council of british medical associations to approve a long-term plan for the promotion of labour action early in september .
the dispute has led to the participation of primary doctors in six strikes this year , including the first full strike in the history of the british national health service .
dr. johann malawana , a junior doctor in the british medical association , resigned after a boycott of the agreed terms of the contract recommended by the british medical association .
during a pre-voting session of 54,000 primary doctors and medical students , he told members of the british medical association that the deal was good and should therefore be accepted .
after the vote , mr. jeremy hunt , health minister , said the contract would be enforced in england &apos;s medical staff .
russia and turkey : &quot; out of the league &quot; ?
a gesture ended a crisis .
russia &apos;s leaders met with turkish leaders on tuesday , shaking hands and announcing a formal end of the eight-month-long war and economic sanctions .
yet , when vladimir putin greeted the president of turkey in a glorified hall in the palace of st. petersburg , i felt a strong feeling that this reconciliation was the best hope of ankara .
yes , the two sides do shake hands .
yet , even as mr putin always sees , putin is only a shallow smile , with little enthusiasm .
it is reported that recep tayyip erdoğan refers to &quot; good friends &quot; putin five times .
i can &apos;t remember it .
at the same time , his commitment to relations with russia will return to the pre-crisis level , or even to a higher level .
the next day , one of the newspapers said mr. erdoğan did not appear to have behaved like nothing .
but i think his enthusiasm suggests something inverse .
however , mr putin &apos;s continued coldness shows that he has not forgotten anything .
indeed , the first thing he mentioned in his opening remarks was the cause of the crisis : turkey &apos;s shooting down a russian warplane at the syrian border .
moscow &apos;s reaction was intense .
mr putin vehemently attacked the incident , accusing ankara of secretly moscow behind .
attacks from so-called friends are more difficult to accept .
it is difficult , if not possible , to re-establish genuine trust .
since november , russian public opinion has also been reversed .
in months , the media controlled by the government carried out an alarming and full attack on ankara .
suddenly , turks seem to be responsible for everything .
among the most serious are accusations from senior officials : mr. erdoğan &apos;s family profits from the illegal oil trading in syria-controlled syria .
he has categorically denied that statement .
the news from st. petersburg , however , shows that it is time to look ahead .
after all , the meeting was premised on putin ’ s apology from president erdoğan of turkey .
russia can declare victory .
for ankara , the benefits of the truce are obvious .
first of all , erdoğan narrowly escaped from his post-coup defeat last month , so he needs the support of all his friends .
the constant terrorist attacks have apparently caused a great deal of blows to him .
there are also economic motives .
russian sanctions have been a major blow to turkey , especially the ban on charter services that can channel millions of russian tourists to the coast of turkey every year .
the figure has fallen by nearly 90 % .
as flights resume , russian travel agencies and charter companies will be relieved .
they will usher in a tidal wave of the mediterranean sea .
national television has predicted even this week that prices for fruits and vegetables will fall as soon as the importation of turkish agricultural products is reopened .
a report from the moscow newspaper vedemosti said : &quot; tourists go , tomatoes come back . &quot;
for moscow , the visit also has additional political value .
ankara is outraged by the weak reaction of the west to the takeover intent .
in addition , ankara has long been dissatisfied with the slow pace of eu negotiations and the long-term involvement of putin ’ s players , who are keen to exploit the political chill and weaken turkey ’ s relations with the west .
in the wake of the failure of the coup d &apos;état to support the elected authorities , the russian leadership will surely be given a bonus in ankara .
note that this is a gift to moscow , which has been a deep-seated fear of regime change .
as a result , a meeting between russia and turkey in two countries rejected and mistreated by the western world has led to an alliance between russia and turkey , and an analyst described it as &quot; a disagreeable union . &quot;
however , despite the open reconciliation , there are still significant differences between the two sides .
syria is one of the key factors , and moscow has recently played a role in syria , while russia and turkey support the opposite .
it is foreseeable that , after nearly three hours of preliminary talks , the two presidents said at a conference that the subject had not yet been addressed .
the president of turkey deliberately eschewed questions about the differences between the two sides , and putin stressed it .
the two sides have not reached a clear consensus on how to seek common ground on syria .
once again , the resumption of dialogue between the leaders of the two countries will certainly be a good thing , given the months of public hostilities brought about by turkey ’ s bombing of russian fighters in the north atlantic treaty organization ’ s member states .
royal bank of scotland will no longer serve customers outside scotland
according to rbs chief executive , banks will be simplified to a logistics unit .
royal bank of scotland will no longer serve customers outside scotland .
ross mcun told the bbc scotland that royal bank of scotland has committed itself to its global ambitions .
but eight years ago , eight years ago , and having to accept relief began to give up like that .
for that time , brand strategists used &apos; rbs &apos; to protect other consumer finance brands .
the group has spent millions of pounds in sponsoring international sporting events such as the six-nation and wimbledon tennis championships .
but right now , the right thing is to make more state brand new .
royal bank of scotland will be used for scottish clients , but will not respond to it .
in england and wales , all references outside the headquarters and stock exchange will be changed to national westminster bank .
the brand of the alst bank has been used for clients in the republic of ireland and the northern ireland autonomous region .
there are also other more prominent smaller private banking brands , such as gu bank , adam &amp; co , drummond and holt &apos;s military bank .
mr. mcun has been interviewed in a tour of clients and staff at inverness county .
&quot; the royal bank of scotland brand will eventually become our investor brand , and it &apos;s one of the employees , &quot; he told the bbc scotland . &quot; we have become a bank with many brands , &quot; he told the bbc .
as the bank itself became an international brand , rbs also became a global brand .
at present , i would like to say that we are no longer focused on the global , and we have turned our eyes to the mainland .
each brand represents the difference in the respective industries , while our employees serve customers through different brands .
rbs has shown that it will not continue to sponsor the six national championships ; meanwhile , efforts have been made to enhance the image of different brands in sports events .
&quot; it &apos;s time to become a multi-branded bank , because in private we &apos;ve been exploring how to become a better customer-service bank , &quot; the chief executive said .
if we were to become a big bank with many brands three years ago it would be ridiculed .
at present we focus on customer requirements and i believe that you have noticed these changes .
i think we can re-launch these brands , and now time is just right .
with predilection &apos;s success in newmantec , mr. dai was able to achieve a career of 3,000 wins
newhorse kent &apos;s two victories helped him get his career 3,000 wins , and then he celebrates champagne
on friday , frank dettori , a professional equator , won his 37,000 victory in newcastle .
the predilection , which came from the hand of john gosden , trained to win two victories in the course of the night , also helped achieve a career of about 3,000 .
the 45-year-old italian is the sixth professional racer to achieve this milestone in the field .
the top five is sir gordon richards , doug smith , lester piggott , pat eddery and willie carson .
&quot; this is very special , &quot; said the three champion jockey , who won earlier in ghayyar .
i &apos;m very excited because my family is on the spot too
i am happy with what i have accomplished in newmantec , since i started out here 30 years ago .
this is not a large-scale jockey club or royal ascot , a regular friday night with 20,000 viewers .
i am very pleased and humble .
the predilection was brought after the victory , and the whole hall was greeted with cheers
in the field of obstacles , two of the riders , who were the champion jockey , and richard johnson , and now retired 20-time champion , anthony mccoy , have won more than 4,300 wins in their record-breaking careers .
he had won 4,493 wins in his career as a champion of the nine th german games
he was one of the greatest riders of the time , so it was no surprise that he had made such a landmark achievement , and few of his achievements had been made before him .
he &apos;s stylish and strong , but what really makes him stand out in the weighing room is his tactical reason .
he was an amazing masterpiece , and his passion and charm had attracted a lot of fans for many years .
a few weeks ago , i told me in epsom that if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and a ranger , he should have won 6,000 games !
indeed , it &apos;s too important to wear chart as the best horse winner in britain for the last thirty years .
he was lively , and this was a good thing for the english horse racing , but in addition to that , he was an incredible rider .
dogis celebrates this milestone with its signature jump-and-horse movements
from the jump to the jump horse , 20 years , dudou has always been a typical representative of the english levelling area .
his career as a roller coaster .
he won the championship of many races , including the famous &quot; seven wins &quot; in 1996 in the royal escola in the united kingdom , but he also suffered a crash and banned the use of banned drugs .
three years ago , when he returned to the field after the expiration of the six-month period , he had had a great deal of effort , but he had shown an astonishing character and , at last , returned to the top and gave the sceptics a great deal of time .
he might not have been able to do so for too long , before he had said that he wished at least to be at least 50 years old .
position of chief , russian president vladimir v. ivanov
vladimir putin , the russian president , unexpectedly lifted the position of chief of the office of president sergei ivanov .
over the years , mr. ivanov has been a core group of mr. putin , mr. putin .
mr. ivanov , 63 , is now appointed special representative on environment and transport .
a statement from the kremlin says mr putin has announced &quot; the release of the head of the office of the president of the russian presidency in ivanov &quot; , but did not give reasons .
anton vaino , who became deputy to mr. ivanov in 2012 , has been appointed as his successor .
mr. ouinano , 44 years old , is a former diplomat .
he was born in tallinn , estonia , in 1972 and graduated from the prestigious moscow state institute of international relations ( mgimo ) , working in the tokyo embassy .
later , he managed the president &apos;s draft and government staff , the kremlin website ( in russian ) .
after his appointment , he said to mr. putin , &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot;
i believe that the most important task of my government is to support the head of state in drafting laws and control orders .
mr. putin told the russian television friday that mr. ivanov had asked for his resignation and recommended mr. ouinano to take over himself .
is there a convincing smile ?
moscow is puzzled by the move .
sergei ivanov has long been one of putin &apos;s closest aides and , like putin , has worked in the soviet security agency ( kgb ) .
as the chef de cabinet , he was one of the most influential people in the country .
at a meeting with president putin on state television , both said the chef de cabinet had asked for his resignation .
although there was a full smile on the front of the camera , few people were convinced - especially at the time before the parliamentary elections .
so , is this the result of a fall in power rivalry ?
not yet known .
but officials say a man who once thought of as a candidate for the presidency has suddenly chosen to embrace russia ’ s environmental policy – a lot of scepticism .
the kremlin website quotes mr. ivanov from the dialogue with mr. putin , saying , &quot; yes , in early 2012 i requested you to give me this difficult position during a dialogue , even a troublesome post , four years of office , &quot; he said .
&quot; as a result , i have served as president &apos;s office for eight months and eight months . &quot;
mr. ivanov assumed his duties in december 2011 .
prior to that , he served as deputy prime minister and minister of defence .
he is a member of the russian security council and , like mr. putin , is a former member of the national security agency .
at the end of the 1990 ’ s , mr. ivanov was appointed as his deputy when mr. putin became the head of the federal security service ( fsb , formerly the national directorate of national security ) .
after mr. putin took office , he also designated mr. ivanov as one of his most trusted five .
mr ivanov was once thought to be the president of the russian presidency after mr. putin &apos;s second term , which was unconstitutional .
but the post ultimately belongs to mr dmitry medvedev , another close associate of putin .
mr. putin took the position of prime minister vladimir putin after three and a half years of re-assuming the presidency .
the mysterious fish startled banff a garden
a resident of banff found fish in his own garden and then asked for help .
kevin bain thinks the 75 fish may have been blown up by a tornado in the sea .
mr. bain , who lived about 500 metres from the sea , released the video on periscope on periscope , hoping someone could explain why the two-inch-long fish would appear .
the kun fei bridge is now open to farf
the pound1.35 billion project is scheduled for completion in may 2017
engineers have linked the north bridge of the queensway bridge ( queensway crossing ) to the bridge , which means that the bridge is now open to justice .
the &quot; bridgeplane fan &quot; near the three bridgehead of each bridge is now nearing completion , and the project is the key to the bridge .
the bridge began 600 metres in length and 30,000 metric tons .
it used 10,000 metric tons of steel , 20,000 metric tons of concrete and 46 oblique cables .
the pound1.35 billion project is scheduled for completion in may 2017 .
economics minister keith brown , who visited the scene today , became one of the first to board the bridge .
he said : &quot; this is a historic moment in the construction of kentsworth bridge . &quot;
we have all witnessed engineering work on such a grand project , using more than 30,000 metric tons of concrete and steel for the construction of the bridge alone .
although the size and weight of the bridge is huge , it is necessary to complete the chunks between the bridge and the bridge , and require very precise assembling .
overall , nearly 79 % of the total bridge is now installed , and the end of the concrete bridge at the last section of the bridge is poured in rosyth today , meaning that all the bridges are ready .
&quot; the first time chong is a major milestone , &quot; said michael martin , director of construction of the company &apos;s construction firm , kunston bridge .
as far as this remarkable project is concerned , the dragon shows the backbone of civil engineering .
after installing the last section and connecting it to the extended north bridge barrier road , there is a need to complete the remaining gap between the north side or near the terrestrial side .
the completion of the operation will require the displacement of 700 mm to the north of the high-rise bridge in the north .
this is a huge operation , and it is also a very sophisticated operation .
it said it was huge because it was 22 metres long , heavy about 6,000 metric tons and needed to pull out a roughly 3 % slope .
it &apos;s sophisticated because engineering teams need to make sure that the deviation is so small that only a few millimeters are on each side .
it is gratifying that everything has progressed smoothly .
simon bayskis won the women &apos;s gymnastics championship
forget about the pressure .
forget the hype .
simone biles is not affected by all this .
the horse is full of vigor .
the balance of wood has a lot of work .
the exercise of free gymnastics is stunning .
the overall performance was excellent .
now , it &apos;s finally the olympic champion .
the 19-year-old american gymnast won the championship on thursday , showcasing her talent for the world in gymnastics at the olympic games .
aly raisman and the bronze medalist , aliya mustafina , who scored a total of 62.198 , were among the top five players , aly raisman and the bronze medalist .
simon byelce , from the united states , performed an equalization wood performance at the gymnastics gymnast of the 2016 olympic games held in rio de janeiro , brazil , on thursday in the summer of 2016 .
bars helped the us team achieve four titles in the women &apos;s gymnastics at the olympic games , with her individual winning five medals at the olympic games , further testifying to her generation and perhaps the best gymnastics team in history .
at the moment when i saw his total score , bells could not help shed tears . finally , she ended the long journey .
bells , therefore , ranks among the “ dozens of years of an athlete ” like michael phelps , who has raised sports projects in their respective fields to a new height :
in the last three years , bars has championed a total of 15 world championships , including ten gold medals , including ten gold medals , each day &apos;s hard training to reach a higher degree of accuracy , according to mary lou retton , an olympic champion in 1984 , who said : &quot; bells was the best gymnast i ever met . &quot;
there is also a final game in brazil , but the game is not so much a competition than the competition of other gymnasts , but rather between herself and the great expectation of pressure .
if the bills don &apos;t return to her home in springers , texas , people will be very disappointed .
simon bills ( left ) from the united states and leslie embraced each other to win gold and silver medals in the artistic gymnastics of the 2016 olympic games held in rio de janeiro , brazil , in august ( thursday ) .
bayce won the first gold medal on tuesday , offering a surprise for the outgoing national coach , martha karolyi .
despite mr bears &apos;s insistence that he hasn &apos;t planned for the future in the midst of the title of the champions league , it is not quite true .
one of bells &apos;s free gymnastics , including her iconic twisting , is the latin music , which is often heard by her only one street in the rio olympic stadium .
this is no coincidence .
the girl who was adopted by grandparents during the infancy and travels in a field trip to a gymnasium has now grown into the backbone of the girl who was discovered by the mother of aimee boorman &apos;s mother .
since the summer of 2013 , he has not lost his hand in the game , and she will win as long as she wants to win .
it &apos;s just a hallucination that musphinana rotates two twists and turns .
the defending world champion bells , the defending world champion of the two projects of equilibrium and free gymnastics , was ambushed .
her balance reached 15.433 and free gymnastics at 15.933 .
while waiting for the final score , lessman gently hugged besles , and when bears learned that he had achieved his dream , he left tears in his eyes .
lestman &apos;s performance was a little like the revenge of four years ago , when she juxtaposed third , but lost him in the victorious bureau .
but this time , the 22-year-old veteran who was called &quot; grandma &quot; was far ahead of it .
she kissed the crowd at the end of the free gymnastics and pronounced it back , but sometimes it seemed doubtful .
byles was 19 years old , and from earlier this week , his news spread around twitter , and in the case of bayce , his life had been given a whole new meaning .
the six-year-old mahaj brown , who was shot in the body , survived the shooting in philadelphia
police say a six-year-old boy was shot in philadelphia , the second six-year-old child in the city &apos;s second shot this week .
the child &apos;s grandparents confirmed to cbs philadelphia that the child was shot at mahaj brown .
they said that brown &apos;s groin , legs , arms and abdomen had many gunshot wounds , but the child was awake on the way to medical treatment .
&quot; he was charged with a number of sins , and his little body was torn by bullets , &quot; his grandmother , delores melendez , said to the television station .
i can &apos;t believe it .
the boy was in critical condition in the hospital and underwent several surgeries .
his family told the television station that the child is expected to recover .
he was supposed to start a year at the local primary school .
brown is one of the four people who have been shot in the germantown area .
of the three others who were shot , two were 29 years old and one was 32 years old .
according to cbs philadelphia , one of the 29-year-old victims was in critical condition ; the other two were stable .
the tv station said the child was found in front of the car with the 29-year-old victim .
two other victims were not in the vehicle , and the police were investigating the presence of gunmen among the wounded .
the investigators told cbs philadelphia that it looked like a lot of gunfire .
a number of bombshell shells were found on the scene , which could be inferred that they were using different offensive weapons .
judging from this , this is undoubtedly a continuing war .
there were shells on the sidewalk on both sides of the street .
&quot; so , as a result , there were many armed men on the scene , &quot; said anthony ginaldi , director of philadelphia police , to the television station .
many houses and vehicles were damaged in the area .
arrests have not yet been carried out , and the police are said to be in tune with the surveillance video .
on tuesday , there was also a six-year-old child ( girl ) who was shot in the arm while playing at the door of the street of the west oak lane community .
she is currently in the process of rehabilitation and the police are still pursuing the suspects .
why do we need simon , gabrielle and laurie
this is why i evaluated this year &apos;s women &apos;s olympic sports team for more than one reason .
first , from 1984 onwards , i went to every summer olympics , but the united states never held it in a dominant position .
second , the gymnastics team has three excellent gymnast , simone biles , gabby douglas and lauren laurie hernandez , who have inspired many coloured girls .
the composition of the team is a great pride for everyone , as it contains aly raisman , the jewish people of judaism , and madison koji , the catholic church .
the team finally looks like the united states team .
it also solidifies the height of black and latino women in this movement .
for the past four years , the first female gymnasts have been african-american .
last year , simon and gabrielle had the first and second places .
this is terrible .
the last olympics , gabriel douglas , &quot; unexpectedly &quot; became the olympic champion , cheered the united states .
today , the world is able to witness the performance of three world champions of simon baers , douglas and laurie hernandez , who defy conventional gymnastics skills .
on thursday , simon helped the united states achieve four crowns on women &apos;s personal full-time projects .
her teammate , ali lesman , beheaded silver .
we have climbed to the top of the sport , but it is not the same in class-wide gymnastics teaching .
simon , gabriel and laurie went into the olympic team to follow ali and madison .
they are the &quot; ultimate five &quot; ( final five ) because the next olympic gymnastics team will consist of four gymnast athletes , marta karolyi for the last year .
but the reality is that gymnastics is a costly sport , with gymnasts being trained primarily in the private gymnastics clubs , whose parents need to pay for training , facilities , travel , clothing , games and hotel expenses , including coaches and gymnast and family costs , and the list of costs is increasing .
most gymnastics clubs are located in a wealthy suburb that can support the industry .
all the gymnasts &apos; training is completed in these clubs , and for gymnasts households is a long-term expensive expense .
bears coach aimee boorman and hernandez coach maggie haney have taught them all since the two gymnast began to practise gymnastics .
we have to offer more affordable , more versatile gymnastics to countless young girls who are affected by simon , gabrielle and laurie .
twenty years ago , i set up my own gymnastics foundation .
in my organization , we provide free and cheap gymnastics to more than 15,000,000 urban youth , mainly black and hispanic americans , in black residential areas and to develop national and world champions .
in september , we will expand to detroit ( my hometown ) to provide high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve this learning opportunity and will benefit from this wonderful olympic movement .
gymnastics helps to develop the strength , flexibility and coordination of the body , and also helps to cultivate the spirit , self-discipline and determination of hard-working and hard work .
these can bring lifelong benefits to the success of a person &apos;s health , education and work .
encouraged by this team , thousands of young girls will learn to gymnastics , which is really good .
this is particularly true for girls , especially for girls .
this is an exciting moment .
thanks to simon , ali , laurie , gabriel and madison for the &quot; power of the girl &quot; in winning the gold medals in the olympic games , they also thank them for motivating so many diverse young girls to open the path to health , power and success .
after rejecting jeremy hunter &apos;s proposal , the primary doctor planned to go on a further strike
ministers initially sought to end the change-induced dispute by accepting a revised contract from bma officials , but 58 per cent of the 37,000 participating primary doctors objected to the contract .
in july , mr. hunt disclosed plans to enforce the contract , saying that the national health service ( nhs ) is currently in a &quot; vacuum zone &quot; , with minor delays hurting employees and patients &apos; interests .
the new contract begins by referring to the revision of primary doctors &apos; overnight and weekend working practices to improve care for non-normal working hours .
yesterday evening , dr. ellen mccourt , chairman of bma &apos;s primary physician committee , said in a statement : &quot; the primary doctor is still seriously concerned about the proposed contract , especially as it exacerbates the current labour crisis and fails to treat all doctors equally . &quot;
just eight weeks after signing the new contract with the first batch of doctors , we need to make progress , and time is running out .
bma tried to settle the dispute through negotiation , but people were reluctant to participate , and sometimes the government responded by silence .
even so , last month we got the promise of jeremy hunt , who said his door remained open .
&quot; jeremy hunter now needs to take action to lift the enforcement and address the concerns of the junior doctor &quot; .
if he did not , the primary doctor made it clear that they were ready to take further labor action .
the last strike took place at the end of april , leading to nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 reservations , as nurses and medical doctors provided cover for doctors on the picket .
the ministers initially hoped to end the change-induced dispute by accepting the bma contract .
bma wants to win a better weekend wage for 54,000 junior doctors involved in the contract .
daniel mortimer , chief executive of nhs employers , called on the junior doctors to stop any further strikes .
mr mortimer said : &quot; there is little effect in labour operations , but on the contrary , it is stressful , responsible for patients , nursing staff and their families , anxiety and confusion , &quot; mortimer said .
over the past two months , we have been negotiating with the committee of first doctors and , together with the ministry of health and other departments , to respond positively to their concerns about the role of guardians and whistle-blowing .
employers want to continue to actively explore other important topics such as the flexibility of deployment , training , training costs for other training , training costs , common understanding of course syllabus , study leave and gender pay in the field of medical care , and the importance attached to the agreements reached in november , february and may with bma in november , february and may by the health education organization of england and the ministry of health .
2 pounds per day reduces the risk of heart attack
officials suggested that a $ 2-day drug be extended to more patients and extended time for medication , and thousands of heart-cancer patients would benefit from the drug .
anticoagulant medicine may reduce the risk of heart disease recurrence in patients with heart disease .
the drug takes 12 months after a heart attack and reduces the risk of a stroke or heart attack again .
the national health and clinical optimization institute ( nice ) of the national health service ( nice ) of the uk recommends that patients continue to take medicine for four years in order to further reduce the risk of heart and vascular disease .
but now nice , the nhs regulator , recommends that the patient continue to take medicine for four years in order to further reduce the risk of heart-vascular disease .
in england , about 140,000 people suffer from heart disease each year , and one in four will continue to suffer from heart disease or stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by plaque in the arteries of the arteries .
if the plaque breaks , it causes thrombosis and prevents the flow of blood into the heart , resulting in a heart attack .
if thrombosis is moved , blood flows into the bloodstream , preventing blood flowing into the brain and causing a stroke .
people who have experienced a heart attack have a higher risk of heart attacks .
it is possible to reduce the risk of pathogenesis by reducing the formation of brilique in order to reduce the risk of the disease by selling it to astrazeneca in astrazeneca .
the nice draft guideline issued today advises patients to take 90 mg for 12 months , and 60 mg per day for three years in the following three years .
dr carole longson , director of the centre for health technology assessment , said : &quot; although there are effective secondary prevention treatment , more than one in a quarter of patients with a history of heart disease can relapse or stroke , often with severe consequences . &quot;
the fear of relapse can have a significant negative effect on the quality of life of a person .
evidence suggests that taking the card together with aspirin can effectively reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke in patients who have experienced heart attack .
we are heartened by the offer of additional treatment options for the hundreds of thousands of people who have benefited from the temporary recommendation of carague .
given the limited information on the efficacy and safety of qgray after three years , especially the risk of hemorrhage , the draft guide does not recommend that it be treated with treatment beyond that period .
the culture of computers has led to the prevalence of the &quot; election fraud &quot; in the muslim region
mr. lutfur rahman , the former mayor of the tower , prompted a government report to be published as a result of corruption last year .
the “ political correctness ” culture has led to widespread electoral fraud in the muslim community , which is revealed today by anti-personnel government reports .
sir eric pickles , former cabinet minister , accused the police , the electoral regulator and the city hall of ignoring evidence of abuse of the election because of &quot; excessive sensitivity to ethnic divisions and religious issues &quot; .
the former minister of community affairs , the current anti-corruption officer , said that the practice of intimidating voters by holding religious positions was bad , and that the police should be allowed to set up police lines outside the polling stations to protect the audacity of the electorate .
he suggested that voters should carry identity papers in order to prove their identity .
currently , voters only need to report their own name and address .
the report even suggests scrubbing ink on voters &apos; fingers to prevent someone from voting twice .
sir eric said that the protection of whistle-blowers should be increased .
he called for increased media coverage of parliamentary documentation and decisions taken by non-official committees or working groups .
&quot; this is not just about preventing electoral fraud , but also in protecting local governments against widespread corrupt culture and the poison of financial fraud that is closely linked to it , &quot; he said .
the report was demanded by downing street after the tower hambo election scandal in london .
last year , a special electoral tribunal ruled that the existence of a series of corruption and illegal acts in the office of mayor rahman should be dismissed .
the court found mr. rahman &quot; very ridiculous to abuse &quot; the religious feelings of the muslim community and not to speak about his allegations of racial discrimination and islamophobia .
mr rahman is said to have &quot; declared his vote at the election as a religious obligation for fidelity muslims . &quot;
as many as 300 votes cast doubt and may be voting by voters .
sir eric says there is evidence of electoral fraud across the country .
he warned in particular about post-election fraud , and senior members of the muslim community were said to have pressured voters to vote for the candidates they had appointed .
sir eric ( in the photo ) has made a number of proposals to clear the voting mechanism , including a good identity document to confirm his identity
&quot; evidence suggests that senior members , especially those in the pakistani and bangladeshi communities , have put pressure on vulnerable groups in some minority communities , especially women and young people , in accordance with their own will , &quot; he said in the report .
“ because of the excessive sensitivity to race and religion ’ s political correctness , they fear that state institutions will turn a blind eye to such behaviour . ”
sir eric has put forward 50 proposals to clear up the electoral mechanism , including forbidding political activists from dealing with mailing documents in order to prevent a &quot; vote &quot; .
the report also requires rigorous examination of registration information to prevent voters &apos; rosters from being used for immigration and welfare fraud .
the recommendations include the requirement that voters show their identity documents before voting .
after the vote , erased ink on the finger of the voters and prevented someone from voting twice .
( c ) systematically verify the nationality of the electorate in order to ensure eligibility for voting .
the expiry date for the automatic mailing request is three years .
political activists and militants were forbidden to handle completed mailing ballots and mail envelopes .
the police were authorized to set up cordons around the polling stations .
amending the provisions of the law makes it easier to prosecute offences against persons in accordance with the people &apos;s representation act 1983 ( covenant of the people act 1983 ) .
it is illegal to be photographed at the polling station .
it is stipulated that english only may be used at polling stations ( except in the wales area ) .
( c ) strengthen training to ensure that staff strictly enforce the provisions of the &quot; voter &apos;s separate ballot hall &quot; .
sir erwich deplores the metropolitan police ( metropolitan police ) , saying that they did not raise any criminal charges after the events of the tower hams .
“ rahmann and his election officers are corrupt and illegal and have been disqualified by election courts , ” he said .
according to the standards of criminal proof , he is indisputably guilty in many ways .
he also criticized the &quot; check box check-box &quot; that the registration office of the city hall voted against .
sir eric said : &quot; last year the court imposed a wake-up call on the tower hams . &quot;
my country has a glorious tradition of &quot; the mother of the parliament &quot; , yet the good reputation is also threatened by private sneaking by some institutions and by the fact that there is a real concern about the fraudulent conduct of electoral fraud and the aftermath .

the commentator , byron mcdonald , made a few remarks at the end of the women &apos;s 4x200m freestyle relay , when he thought his microphone had been switched off .
&quot; the 14-year-old chinese girl made a stupid mistake , &quot; said byron , the 14-year-old chinese girl .
it was so excited that it began to swim faster than bad breath , but later it was as slow as a pig .
it &apos;s a lot of thanks to her .
the 14-year-old chinese swimmer , aide , is the second rod , with 1 , 57 seconds , behind canada &apos;s taylor ruck , 61 seconds , and then the canadian team has narrowed the gap with china .
the entire canadian audience was surprised by the tone and wording of the commentator , who responded quickly to the network
emmett macfarlane said : &quot; the cbc commentator said that the 14-year-old swimmer in china &quot; is as slow as a pig . &quot;
the idiot was not aware that it was being broadcast live .
&quot; the 14-year-old chinese girl made a silly mistake , &quot; china mini , who took part in the women &apos;s 4x200m freestyle relay final , was described as saying : &quot; the 14-year-old chinese girl made a silly mistake . &quot;
the criticism of byron mcdonalds quickly came to the end of twitter , and many asked him to quit .
when the twitter user heard about byron mcdonald &apos;s slow response , they did not stop .
another twitter user , sarah paradis , wrote : &quot; wow # byron macdonald .
what you mean is cbc and canada , and your words and deeds make all of us sound like a bunch of racist .
&quot; we apologized for the comments from the live swimmers , &quot; said cbc broadcasting presiding officer scott russel , who apologized for a live broadcast on byron &apos;s speech .
&quot; we apologize for the anachronism . &quot;
cbc apologized for more than 90 twitter users who responded to the remark
another commentator , scott russel , also apologized on behalf of byron
after cbc , their apologies were copied to more than 90 other twitter users who protested byron
the channel also quickly apologized and issued a statement .
we apologize for saying that and sending it out .
last night , we took prompt action to pay attention to our audience and to pay attention to our audience in social media .
what needs to be said is that byron &apos;s explanation is aimed at the swimmer &apos;s performance , but not to her individual .
that is to say , the wording is not appropriate , and byron is deeply sorry .
on thursday afternoon , mr. macdonald apologized , saying his words did not mean a half-point physical assault and tried to justify his statement .
&quot; i want to spend some time apologizing for what i said last night after the women &apos;s relay race , &quot; he said on the cbc olympics .
&quot; i &apos;m just commenting on the performance of a swimmer , not an individual . &quot;
&quot; of course , i don &apos;t mean disrespectful , i &apos;m sorry . &quot;
the woman was angry at a woman who wore underwear at the shop without shame
a woman in the middle of a primark &apos;s shop was stripped to try panties , where the customers didn &apos;t know where to look .
worse still , she looked at how she looked and then removed her underwear to the shelf .
she continued to browse through the shelves and tried four pairs of underwear at the shop in the bouverie place shopping centre in folkta .
the woman continually tried underwear in the primark store , the bouverie place shopping centre in folkley , and then returned the shelves
also at the store &apos;s jenny davidson ( mother of two children ) said , &quot; after the underwear , the mysterious woman &quot; dressed again and went out of the shop and bought nothing . &quot;
&quot; everyone can &apos;t believe what i see , &quot; she said .
she stood in the middle of the shop , took off her underwear from the shelf and took off his tights and panties , and then put it on .
&quot; she did not try to find a hiding place to try - she just stood there . she was shameless .
when she took her underwear down again , everyone was stunned . apparently , she was not satisfied , because she put her underwear back on the shelf .
after that , she tried three times , and finally found it was not her favorite , and then dressed herself again and went out of the shop .
&quot; she did not seem to care that someone was watching her -- or had not thought who would eventually buy the underwear she had tried .
ms. davidson ( 33 ) , who lives in the town of kent , said : &quot; it is nauseous to think that someone will buy the underwear that others have worn without being washed . &quot;
it happened on tuesday afternoon .
ms. davidson added : &quot; after she leaves , the assistant obviously wants to do the underwear , fortunately . &quot;
&quot; i hate buying a new underwear , but i find another woman tried and unwashed . &quot;
&quot; primark already knows what happened in our folkshop on tuesday , august 9 , &quot; a primark spokesman said .
all problematic commodities have been dropped .
how to protect yourself with horseman during gunshot attacks
the world is dangerous , but this video on dailymail.com may give you a sense of security .
we refer to rhon mizrachi , master of krav maga federation in new york , to learn how to deal with gunmen at close range .
whether he is from the front or behind you , the video will teach you how to win the victory .
if the shooter is close to you , the first thing you have to do is turn around so that you can see the attackers and &quot; clear the line &quot; , mizrachi said .
then , clamp the gun with the forearm and the shoulder and hit the attacker with your elbow .
next , with his knee on his groin , the attacker swayed his gun , shot his face with a gun barrel and a back-up gun , and kept his weapons straight at him when he bent over the body with pain .
if the gunman moves from the front and uses similar tips to get your body out of the fire , seize the gun and reverse the gun so that the gunman can &apos;t fire .
at the same time , the weight was pressed against the gun and struck the attacker &apos;s chest and turned the gun from his clasped hands and then pointed the gun at him .
that sounds complicated ?
look at the video and see what mizrachi did .
but remember , if you &apos;re not the maxim master , if you want to get out of the robbery , the safest way is to hand over cash .
a rogue family destroys the cheap house in soltash in cornwall in the face of drive-in
one of the rogue families who had been evicted for the purpose of intimidating a neighbour had damaged his or her low-rent house before leaving , causing a loss of 50,000 pounds .
after a long list of complaints , tanya skeldon was evicted from his husband , shaun trebilcock , who was evicted from the low-rent house in sotash , cornwall .
after being forcibly removed from the home , the housing association officer was surprised to find that there had been serious damage .
the walls were full of holes , where the floor was torn and the trash thrown everywhere , and the walls of the wall were covered in a mess .
after being expelled , the family has been moving , and is said to live in private houses
donna mcever , housing manager at cornwall housing society , said she was concerned that the house could not be saved .
&quot; it &apos;s a nightmare for people who live here , &quot; she said . &quot; i don &apos;t think anybody can live this way . &quot;
there are so many things to weigh , because the house is likely to be a poor element in cornwall .
the family is notorious , and their names are also notorious .
the couple have three sons who live here from time to time , and the police say the terrorist acts include the use of baseball sticks in the streets , intimidating residents , drug-trafficking , shouting , quarrelling , and cursing .
in june , the 47-year-old named skeldon received a resolution on anti-social behaviour .
in the house that might have been demolished , many rooms were kept for long periods of garbage
the floor was lifted out of the room where drugs had been traded
neighbors said they often saw them fighting in the streets , and often called the police
after giving 11 weeks to extend their voluntary departure , the cornwall housing society forcibly removed her from her husband this week .
the neighbors cheered , they said , and the previous life was a hell of a world .
&quot; they don &apos;t care about anyone , &quot; said one neighbor .
we lived next door for twenty years , and it was so bad .
we have seen the police on countless occasions .
we couldn &apos;t sleep this morning .
we got up early because it &apos;s so quiet - we &apos;re not used to it !
it was wonderful that they had finally left .
adam fitzpatrick , a community executive manager at cornwall &apos;s county housing society , said the family failed to fit well with the local government .
the family lived in the house for 20 years , and the police made frequent visits
garbage and old toys were thrown on the side of the cheap house
he added : &quot; it is regrettable that the tenant did not incur any responsibility for her and her family &apos;s actions , and that expulsion was the last resort of cornwall county housing society . &quot;
this is a very difficult case , because their behavior is extremely extreme , and their actions must give the neighbors a sense of fear .
i thank my team for the work it has done , and i should like to thank devon and cornwall county police and the community members who are brave enough to provide information to us .
i hope that this will bring some comfort to neighbours and convey the message that we have no tolerance for antisocial behaviour .
mr. fitzpatrick said that their three sons had lived in the house at different times , but also said they were in their 20s .
one of the bedrooms had a dirty mattress on the floor of one of the bedrooms after their removal
the workers of the housing association will soon clean up the pile of rubbish around the house
in 2014 , the police searched the house , found more than 70 grams of marijuana , and found the balance of the balance , drug use and 1,700 cash .
after the confession , skeldon was fined for possession of b-class drugs and drug trafficking .
she claims that money was used to buy a tombstone for lee skeldon , son of a car crash in 2013 .
it is understood that after the homeless , tanya and her husband now live in a private house in plymouth .
the walls of the room were painted with graffiti .
police say they will deport tenants who violate the tenant &apos;s rules .
angela crow , a police station in devon and cornwall , said the eviction issued a clear warning to other tenants who continued to violate the tenant &apos;s rules .
&quot; the warning is directed at those who believe that their actions will not be stigmatized , and those who are victims of such acts , &quot; she said .
devon and cornwall county police do not tolerate crime and anti-social behaviour , and they will continue to work together to protect our communities .
rhett : hillary clinton will nominate garland to the supreme court
senate democrat leader harry reid said he was sure he would nominate judge merrick garland to the supreme court if democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton was elected president .
senate republicans have been blocking the confirmation of garland since president barack obama has nominated garland in march .
mitch mcconnell , the senate multi-party leader , said the next president would choose the man to replace the late supreme court judge , antonin scalia .
at a conference call thursday , mr. reid said he predicted clinton would choose &quot; some credibility &quot; with garland .
a spokeswoman for reid said later that rhett had not nominated garland to speak directly to hillary clinton , saying he was just speculating .
he praised garland and said that her team did not want to &quot; upset &quot; for new candidates .
garland is the chief justice of the united states federal district office of the united states of columbia .
reid says republicans who stopped garland &apos;s nominee are republican presidential candidates donald trump ’ s “ pet ” and “ achievers ” .
he says trump is unsuitable for president .

this time , they plan to look for a new generation of top models for their 20nu muses calendar , not a famous nudity .

&quot; we need to show the eternal and classic nudity that makes women and men feel comfortable , and this is inspired by this time , &quot; says shaw in a calendar press conference .

the french courts rejected the petition for the removal of shops in the jungle camps
the french court rejected the petition by the galai government to dismantle dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the &quot; jungle &quot; camp , which currently resides in the thousands of refugees .
at the court hearing this week , the government of garry argued that the government of france should have the right to dismantle a total of 72 temporary shops in the camp , selling goods from cigarettes to energy drinks in the camps , offering haircut services , selling tea at 50 cents ( 40 pence ) in makeshift restaurants or selling basic dishes at a price of a few dollars .
the office of the governor of galley believes that these locations should be dismantled , as they are parallel economies of non-payment and fire and health hazards .
humanitarian groups have expressed the view that these stores and restaurants are of great importance to the courts , since free food provided by associations and other groups supported by the state simply does not meet the needs of the growing refugee population in the camps .
these makeshift stores and restaurants often provide shelters and free food for people in need , they said .
a court ruled that there was no legal basis to expel the operator of the 72 temporary stores , but said that the governor &apos;s fears were &quot; quite understandable &quot; .
according to judge jean françois molla , the role of these grocers , cafes and restaurants is much more than simply providing food to those who &quot; live in extremely dangerous conditions &quot; .
these places are , he said , a peaceful confluence between refugees and volunteers .
one of the sites was threatened by the &quot; jungle book kids &quot; cafe in the camp , which provides 200 food , english and french lessons every day and offers asylum advice to hundreds of unaccompanied vulnerable minors in the refugee camp .
more than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect the cafe .
in a letter to guardian , the guardian wrote that &quot; closing the cafe &quot; would be a catastrophe for these children , many of whom are only eight years old .
both charities and l &apos;auberge des koreas predicted that the number of refugees in the bush camp had reached a breakthrough of 9,000 , which was the highest in the summer after the surge in refugees .
&quot; this 5,000 dollars has helped me to solve my immediate needs . &quot;
fengsheng county chief yung chin forced village poverty in the village of poor jianjun girl girl zhou fen received a letter from the university of nanhua university .
when she was worried about school fees , she was able to give her $ 5,000 in a timely manner to her on august 9 .
in the coming days , the relevant departments of the county have also implemented 2.88 million yuan in education for more than 690 needy students .
at the same time , special difficulties in the family &apos;s economic situation have helped to complete their studies , including through the organization of social contributions .
in the course of this year , more than 18.5 million yuan and over $ 2.5 million have been spent on financial self-financing .
she said gratefully : &quot; i thought my father had passed away , my brother and i were not college anymore , i didn &apos;t think of the county to solve problems in a timely manner . &quot;
as of 8 august , a total of more than 21.1 million yuan had been implemented in the first half of this year for 13,140 needy students .
all poor students in the county have achieved their assistance , and the supplement is supplemented .

&quot; one of the best music halls in the world is the sydney opera house , &quot; said rolly jeff , managing director of the sydney symphony orchestra .
non-beijing residents who have resided in beijing for more than six months and who have legal stability in employment , legal and stable residence and continuous enlistment in beijing may apply for a residence permit .
recently , the implementation of the provisional regulations on residence permit in beijing means that the &quot; temporary residence permit &quot; will be upgraded to &quot; residence permit &quot; .
according to officials in the relevant department , the shift from &quot; temporary &quot; to &quot; residence permit &quot; meant that beijing &apos;s permanent resident population would shift from &quot; management &quot; to multi-location services .
the reporter learned from the state administration of taxation today that at the end of june this year , tax authorities at all levels had issued 2,470 cases of illegal &quot; blacklist &quot; cases .
it is understood that in july 2014 , the state administration of taxation took one step in the central government &apos;s functional department and published the information dissemination scheme for major tax cases in conjunction with the tax credit administration scheme .
not only the facts of the case but the legal basis , the handling of the punishment will be published , and the basic information of the parties in conflict with the law , as well as those responsible for the intermediaries concerned , will also be exposed to the blacklist .
government departments such as quality inspection , finance and customs have also taken relevant disciplinary measures against the &quot; blacklist &quot; parties .
the credit repair mechanism is an important milestone in the construction of tax credit system and the construction of the credit system of the whole society , which marks the improvement and maturity of our country &apos;s social credit system .
&quot; environmental problems are found in the atmosphere , water , soil pollution , but the roots are still in the production way of life . &quot;
for example , in 2015 , the land development of jiangsu province was as high as 21 per cent , with the highest number in the province of the national province .
therefore , the problem of high pollution , large energy and multi-space has not been fundamentally dealt with in the way of production lifestyle .
on the one hand , from all kinds of eco-environment creation in jiangsu province , the absolute predominance is the highest in the country ; on the other hand , the resource environment carries a high pressure .
the promotion of eco-environmental protection and governance requires a fundamental advance in the transformation of production lifestyles , and the construction of eco-civilization for the transformation of the people living in the transition .

the right to discharge pollutants is also called &quot; emitting right &quot; , which is the right to discharge pollutants and means that the emitters have the right to discharge pollutants into the environment according to law , within the limits allocated by the government .
this right is , in essence , the rights of the polluter to the possession , use and benefit of environmental capacity resources .
the next step , in the case of total pollutant emissions not exceeding permitted emissions , the sources of internal pollution control the emission levels of each other through the exchange of money .
emissions trading has since been proposed by us economist dells in 1968 , and the united states has managed to apply it to atmospheric and river pollution sources since the 1970s .
since 2007 , the pilot has been piloted , with 14 provinces such as zhejiang and jiangsu ( district and city ) being fully implemented .
according to the russian ministry of defence , in order to assist the six strategic bombers in carrying out air strikes against the islamic state of syria targets in syria , many russian warplanes have supported the lifting of the air force base in the syrian arab republic .
on 22 february this year , the united states and russia agreed to a cease-fire in the syrian arab republic , which began on 27 february .
according to the agreement , the cease-fire does not include military strikes against terrorist groups , such as the &quot; islamic state &quot; , and other united nations security council resolutions .
russia will continue to build military infrastructure at the base , and the living conditions of russian troops will be guaranteed accordingly .
he also said the forces would extend to russia if they did not attack extremist forces .
while russia and the west have not agreed on a joint fight against extremist forces , russia will strengthen cooperation with syria , iran and iraq in this regard .
in september 2015 , russia began a military strike against extremist forces at the invitation of the syrian government .
on 15 march this year , the russian military forces in the syrian arab republic began to withdraw , but the russian side is committed to maintaining its presence in the hermiemi airbase and the naval base in tartus .

in shanghai , wujiang district authorities recently used electronic police to train drivers to play mobile phones , more than 30 in a week .
with the popularity of smartphones , mobile phones are becoming more and more fun , brushing , edging , and playing games , many people seem to have to stay out of the cell phone and can &apos;t even stop driving .
the road traffic safety act explicitly prohibits driving on mobile phones and defines it as &quot; an obstacle to safe driving &quot; .
unfortunately , this phenomenon has not been duly punished for such reasons as the violator and forensics , and the provisions of the law have been set aside .
if the pipeline department can make up its mind to play mobile phone behavior &quot; declare war &quot; , to normalize this measure , this illegal behavior must be deterred .

china &apos;s mars plan is coming
our mars mission is about a journey around , touchdown , this form has never been in foreign countries .
our mars explorer target is an attempt to surround , land , inspect , and this task is quite difficult .
because mars &apos; exploration takes 26 months to meet a time window , experts are tightening up its plans to launch our first mars probe into the 2020 window .
although our aircraft are already in deep space , the mars exploration mission is still indispensable , and the exploration of mars means that china is moving from a real sense to the time of deep-space exploration , he said .
&quot; once every two or three years , there is a mars-nearest opportunity to launch a mars probe at this point in time for the launch vehicle . &quot;
&quot; considering the quality of the martian detector , the launch mission will be carried out by our long march 5 carrier rocket . &quot;
our mars mission is about a journey around , touchdown , this form has never been abroad and has once been surrounded and toured by a foreign country , but the landing failed .
there are many technical areas involved in the exploration of mars , especially in view of the fact that , while the martian vehicle is a space detector , it has a distinctive feature compared with the general space detectors .
in other words , mars detectors have the capacity to determine the route of travel and to detect obstacles .
pompeg , a researcher at the chinese academy of space science and technology , said that human reason for exploring mars is because the exploration of mars has important science , technology , and so on . it is even relevant to the future of mankind .
mars has now become the planet with the highest levels of human research beyond earth , and the history of human use of space probes for the exploration of mars has virtually penetrated the entire history of human space .
therefore , mankind hopes to establish a living base on mars one day and eventually to emigrate to mars , turning it into a second homeland of mankind .
there are plenty of signs that mars is likely to be the same as the current earth , only after a few billion years of evolution into the atmosphere &apos;s thin atmosphere , lower temperatures , and depletion of water sources .
therefore , the study of exploration or manned landing on mars could provide a preponderant case for preventing the earth from becoming a second planet that would make it difficult for us to live .
as of june 2016 , the world had conducted 114 lunar exploration and 43 mars exploration .
however , from the 1990s to date , humans have conducted 18 rounds of mars &apos; exploration , while lunar exploration has been conducted only 14 times .
there are currently five mars orbiters and 2 mars roaming vehicles working , but only one-month ball track and one-month ball lander are working .
the world &apos;s spacefaring nations have developed sounding plans aimed at the mars system , which shows that the mars exploration is still hotter than lunar exploration .
on 5 november 2013 , india launched its first mars probe , &quot; manganrian &quot; , to become the first asian country to successfully detect mars .
&quot; manganian &quot; is used to study the surface , size and mineral characteristics of mars , exploring whether there are any signs of methane and life on mars .
the hardest part of the mission is that it is only one chance to get a probe into the aerodynamic shape and parachute deceleration after entering the martian atmosphere
there are many technical challenges to the mars exploration mission , according to sun zozhou , head of mars explorer general of the company &apos;s five-yard company .
the atmosphere in mars is very low , with only 1 % of the earth &apos;s surface atmospheric pressure , with a high degree of uncertainty .
scientists do not have a thorough understanding of the factors associated with its changes and the characteristics of storms .
mars often forms dust storms similar to the earth &apos;s dust storms in the summer , which will lead to a sharp drop in solar energy received by the marines , which must be designed to design a &quot; hibernation &quot; mode for the starters to wait patiently for the dust storm past .
at the same time , the mars atmosphere has a cut-off effect on the sun &apos;s light , which poses a challenge to the energy supply of mars .
this requires that the sun wing area of the probe be larger and that it is constantly adjusted to aim at the direction of the sun .
also , the mars surface gravity is only 38 per cent of the earth , but most of the gravity of the surface of the moon is greater than that of the surface of the moon .
&quot; the most difficult and difficult place for the mars exploration mission is to see the probe into the aerodynamic shape and deceleration of the martian atmosphere , but only once an opportunity must ensure success . &quot;
sun zozhou said the entire process could not be controlled by the ground due to the distance between the earth and mars , so it must be done autonomously .
since there is not so much propellant to offset that high speed , when landing on mars , the deceleration depends on the mars atmosphere , but mars &apos;s atmosphere is difficult to simulate on the ground .
in general , the way to explore mars is similar to that of detecting the moon , and it is &quot; around , down , to travel , back to , &quot; and finally to achieve the goal of a manned landing on mars .
since mars is much farther away from earth than the moon , it is difficult to detect a series of more sophisticated technologies .
according to taiwanese media reports , the &quot; president of the administration &quot; announced yesterday morning that the &quot; regulations on the improper acquisition of property by political parties and their attachments &quot; came into force today .

mr. lin also announced that the vice-chairman of the committee should be appointed by the deputy director of the icac , hong kong .
he said that by using mr huntong &apos;s experience in dealing with major cases in the past , he would be the basis for the committee &apos;s investigation of related misconduct cases , he said .
today , as long as there is still party production , no one will give you social donations , and if the party &apos;s production is confiscated , the kuomintang can ask for social support and patronage , &quot; today is not the chance to go . &quot;
he also stressed that the kuomintang party had not been completely confiscated and confiscated , and that the remainder of the party &apos;s party had not been completely confiscated and confiscated , and that the remainder of the party would still be allowed to go out and leave the party with zero , and the party had to start from scratch .

she first shot an arrow in the fourth grade of elementary school until the 27-year-old won the first man &apos;s gold medal in the world cup in 2014 , making it a relatively late player .
&quot; i didn &apos;t have a level in the middle school to take part in the national race , &quot; zhang said .
zhang , who won only fourth place in the olympiad in london four years ago , lost the olympic ticket to win two gold medals twice as much as his co-worker and friend .
zhang , who has spoken after the women &apos;s archery award ceremony after the end of the award ceremony , said , &quot; until the end is just as soon as possible to shoot an arrow , may have brought a good result , satisfied with satisfaction . &quot;
the 28-year-old south korean archery &quot; a sister &quot; , the london olympic archery winner of the gold medal winner has won the bronze medal .
in the semi-final he lost to zhang hui , a bronze medal in asian olympiad alexandra valentia .

although not confirmed , many sources say apple &apos;s 2016 fall will be held in september , and the iphone 7 is coming .
while apple has not responded , the new iphone features have been released , and even the online iphone 7 &quot; real-machine model &quot; image has emerged .
a new generation of iphones can be described as &quot; remarkable &quot; , hot , tight , and wealthy ... if you want the first time to buy positive things , you have to choose a good channel , say , su ning .
this has added to the disappointment of the new cellphone , which has long been unable to shoot holographic images ! the iphone is terrible .
the iphone7 , like the other iphone , is accompanied by innumerable secrets before birth .
in addition , there are many sources that the new generation will lift the 3.5-mm headphone interface and use bluetooth connection and rechargeable interface , which will provide space for apple &apos;s second loudspeaker .
another piece of evidence to support this news is that apple has long been able to allow headphones to produce headphones that are connected with the rechargeable interfaces as early as 2014 .
these news or true or false answers until the fall of apple &apos;s 2016 fall .
but this does not prevent the industry from seeing the iphone 7 &apos;s foreground 鈥 ? many believed that the iphone 7 would be likely to be the last of apple &apos;s last big upgrade to the iphone series .
the market share of the iphone declined , though data from idc , a former market research institute , came to light .
goldman sachs has maintained its &quot; buy-in &quot; ratings , while bmo analysts believe that the iphone 7 will reap a historic sales score .
meanwhile , ceo hock tan , the company &apos;s chief executive , said apple &apos;s future revenue will increase by more than 20 % , thanks to the launch of the iphone 7 .
seven percent of the respondents said they had plans to buy iphone7 , compared with just 4 % of the planned iphones two years ago .
it is understood that 20 per cent of the user groups currently holding the iphone6 or 6 plus plan to purchase the iphone7 is a fairly high proportion .
second , there is an expert analysis , most of the fruit will like to replace the iphone cell phone from generation to generation .
according to statistics , about 26 % of all iphone users have not changed their mobile phones for two years , and about 120 million users have been using the iphone for two years .
according to the media , during the production of the iphone7 , taiwan experienced several earthquakes , &quot; the destruction of the power production facilities is beyond imagination and is likely to have an impact on the initial iphone7 supply . &quot;
the contradiction between supply and demand affects ordinary users , and it is time to choose a good channel , with the first-time price starting with the original iphone7 .
according to people familiar with the matter , the company recently met with apple in high-level meetings aimed at preparing sufficient supplies .
operators have already talked to suining , and it can be anticipated that with the depth of cooperation between the two sides will inevitably lead to lower prices and better service for users .
at the lowest price , consumers may be able to buy iphone7 for seven yuan a day .
adequate sources of goods and diversified preferences make the purchase of the iphone 7 no longer &quot; pressure mountain &quot; , and su ning &apos;s logistics , is more a more intuitive sense of experience .
maybe you &apos;ll get a phone call in the middle of the night . &quot; hello , suining &apos;s easy to buy , your iphone7 . &quot;

&quot; we have learned about the reasons that may lead to the coloring of the ponds and the alkalinity of the water quality . &quot;
the water sports centre conducted a series of tests on water quality , and hundreds of divers and swimmers used the pool to determine water quality standards .
&quot; we &apos;ve been going through normal procedures these days , but we may have overlooked that the more athletes may have an impact on the quality of water . &quot;
&quot; but changes in the color of the water must certainly be healthy for the body , especially for athletes . &quot;
&quot; the independent team confirmed our assessment and confirmed the measures we had taken to restore normal color and normalcy to the pool . &quot;
&quot; we had hoped that the morning pool would be able to return to normal color , but its recovery was affected by the rain . &quot;

on the morning of 12 august , the state council office of public information held a press conference on the economic performance of the national economy in july 2016 .
a spokesman for the national bureau of statistics , the director of the national economic integration statistics division , said that in july , the growth of the national economy was somewhat slower , but still running at a reasonable interval .
figures released by the national bureau of statistics show that data on fixed-asset investment growth and total imports fell in july .
for july &apos;s national economic performance , i would like to borrow a word from the prime minister that the prime minister has said &quot; shape , fluctuating , and still good , &quot; which will provide a better overview of the economic performance of the month of july .
he explained that &quot; waveform fluctuation &quot; meant that some economic indicators grew in july .
because the economy is still in deep adjustment in july , the international situation is complicated and changeful , the world economic recovery is less than expected , so export pressure is still relatively large .
in the domestic situation , the whole economy is at a critical stage of adjustment , the adjustment is released , the economy faces a small downward pressure , so some of the indicators have fluctuated .
it is also noted that in july there is also a special case , the flood disaster is more serious , the hot summer weather has had some effects on the production and operation of some areas .
according to the recent release of the ministry of civil affairs , more than 60 million people were affected by disasters and the direct economic losses exceeded 200 billion yuan .
from industry , investment and transport-related indicators , the different levels of these areas have been affected .
the volume of cargo turnover in july was 3.6 percentage points lower than last month , and floods have had a bearing on the traffic in these areas .
judging from these factors , some of the indicators for july are also normal and in anticipation .
he said that &quot; the trend is still good &quot; , although economic growth has fallen , but the economy is generally stable , steady and steady , and there is no change in stability .
the cpi rose 1.8 per cent in july , with an increase of 0.2 per cent and a 2.1 per cent rise in the consumer price for 1-7 , so the price situation is generally stable .
according to the statistics of high temperature weather in district counties according to chongqing meteorological bureau &apos;s portal , all the rest of the city can receive a different high-temperature allowance .
at least 28 provinces across the country have identified the criteria for the granting of allowances , although the standards are different in the provinces and municipalities , while chongqing receives a high-temperature allowance in the form of a high-temperature working day allowance .
below 35 ° c below the standard of $ 10 per person per person per day ; and at least $ 37 per person per day at a rate of not less than 15 yuan per person per day .
high-temperature staff above 40 ° c may receive a maximum of 20 yuan / day allowance per month ( except for workers already enjoying high-temperature job allowance in accordance with the law ) .
according to this criterion , the canton with the maximum hot weather during the last month is allowed to receive 330 yuan and the lowest number of days is 80 yuan , while the highest temperature of the monoyang is not higher than the high temperature standard , so there is no high temperature allowance .
many units in the past would rush to high-temperature subsidies in cool drinks and the city &apos;s security bureau said such practices were not in line with the current approach .
the employing units shall not deduct or reduce their wages because of the cessation of work and the reduction of working hours due to high temperature weather .
the municipal people &apos;s bureau said that employees had not received a high-temperature allowance at high temperatures but sought legal benefits through the employer &apos;s labour dispute mediation , or filed 12333 complaints .
if an employer refuses to issue a high-temperature allowance , the laborer may lodge a complaint with the human resources social security department at the county level above the county level .
at the same time , due to the fact that the high-temperature allowance is part of the wage , it is not a benefit to be included in the total wage and a deduction of the individual tax .
therefore , the high-temperature allowance is not paid in the lowest wage range and must be issued in cash , not in kind , such as beverages .
the newly-built urumqi station stands in the urumqi region , with an entire area of about 100,000 square metres .
on the ground 1 , 2 floors are incoming stations , waiting halls and offices , commercial rooms , and the first floor of the basement level .
at present , urumqi station is the largest integrated transport hub in xinjiang , which combines high-speed rail , rail transit , public transport , renting and so on .
there are three conductor offices on both sides of the platform and the north side of the terminal layer , with 39 manual ticket windows and 34 automatic ticket tellers .
on both sides of the waiting hall , there are 30 channels on both sides of the waiting hall , which can be inspected for quick identification and waiting for passengers .
if you need help , you can get timely service if you select the 41 calling buttons installed in the near-click button .
from july 1st , the old passenger station , which is the passenger train of urumqi south station , arrived at urumqi station on a step-by-step basis .
that is to say , all cars and 30 trains can stop at urumqi station .
now both stations can buy a ticket , the train time between them is around 10 minutes , and the passenger will need to pay attention to the concrete name of the ticket and terminal station .
the official operation of urumqi new station will become an important platform for the establishment of a comprehensive national and comprehensive transportation city in xinjiang , promoting the &quot; silk road economy &quot; and the construction of new districts .
grecian is an embryonic female bulb with the smell of tropical rainforest all over .
in the central american countries , the story of gracihua and its story has long been a household name .
at a news conference on august 10 , after surgery , grey , who recovers after surgery , has unveiled its brand-new 3d print-plastic beak .
this one-and-a-half-year-old beak , dying and dying mouth bird , is now resurrected .
this day not only declared that it had recovered 100 per cent of its health , but it moved into the luxury birdhouse , a day of meeting with the human friends who cared about it .
grecian , who first entered the new home , was slightly shy but became lively when he was not long , played in the sink and ate the grape with a new beak .
to remind people of the damage it had suffered , the technicians did not color its new beak but retained the original white color of the 3d print material .
outside the beak is a thin layer of corneal sheaths , hollow in it , and only some fine bone sticks are arranged in a crisscross line .
despite this internal reinforcement , the bulb &apos;s beak is still fragile and it breaks down when it hurts .
the animal rescue center , bird scientists and an american 3d print company worked together to create several &quot; test beaks &quot; for grecian , which finally made the &quot; perfect beak &quot; .
now grecian has been able to use the new beak to drink , eat , and even peck at tiny grains .
&quot; the final finished product has been designed for about two months , printing out just four or five hours . &quot;
&quot; 3-d print is not a future technique , and it &apos;s actually going into your life , &quot; said thomas langg , chairman of sg3d print , a us , in an interview with xinhua news agency .
in january 2015 , a farm in gujaria , central ahuela province , central costa rica , was found in graysa , the bloodthirsty mousebird of blood .
at that time its beak was brutally broken by a gang of youths , it was completely unable to eat and life was dying .
following media coverage in greecia , there was an outcry against animal abuse , both inside and outside costa rica .
more stringent animal protection laws were required to increase the penalties for ill-treatment .
people came forward to do their utmost to help grace restore the life of her injured as much as possible .
even 3d printing technology inventor chuck hull also took part in the design of graham &apos;s beak .
&quot; grecian is exceptional , and its upper beak is less than one centimetre , so it has many difficulties for installing a new beak . &quot;
&quot; we first scanned the gypsy scan and then designed it to produce a longer break in the remainder of its beak , with glue fixed on its own beak . &quot;
&quot; this reduces further invasive injury to grid , &quot; langg told xinhua news agency .
before installing the false body , staff must clean up the beak for grey every day to prevent infection .
far away from thousands of miles , the story of taoist greyce moved the famous documentary director paula elydia and explore news channel producer john hoffmann .
they recorded a drop in the new beak process in greecia , recording a documentary , &quot; the big talk , &quot; which was aired on the zoo on an animal planet this month .
the documentaries are showing people how to make a country change and how to involve nationals in the fight against cruelty to animals .
core tip : japanese oil companies are particularly wary of the rise of china &apos;s small independent refineries , known as teapot .
jx energy , the largest oil company in japan , said on aug. 12 that japan &apos;s export expansion is one of the causes of the downturn .
japanese oil companies are particularly wary of the rise of china &apos;s small independent refineries , known as teapot .
the quality of petroleum products in china is gradually approaching japan &apos;s oil products as a result of china &apos;s enhanced environmental regulations .
prior to obtaining the import permit for crude oil , the &quot; teapot refinery &quot; generally imports heavy oil from the russian equivalent of higher sulphur content .
the amount of sulfur content produced by petroleum products is higher and the oil product is poor , it is one of the causes of environmental pollution .
with the import of crude oil , the teapot will be able to import crude oil and russian crude oil with a relatively low sulphur content , and the quality of its petroleum products has also risen .
according to the east-fired general oil company , the ability of refining equipment has increased as the quality standards of petroleum products are increasing in china .
as a result , the quality of petroleum products exported by china gradually reached the same level as japan &apos;s ( the world &apos;s highest quality ) .
jx energy says , after the end of 2015 , china is exporting high-quality light oil to australia , competing with japanese products in the asian market .
despite the fact that japan &apos;s high-grade oil is facing a crisis , japanese oil companies have responded by focusing only on &quot; market-oriented exports to areas where profits are available &quot; .
as china &apos;s export of petroleum products has a huge impact on asian market prices , the focus on the teapot refineries is also getting higher .

ultraviolet light not only allowed the students &apos; skin to become black , more sunburn skin , how to let the skin smooth through the military training , do not suffer from sunburn ?
sunscreen is generally marked with spf and pa , spf is the uv index , a common spf index of 15 , 30 and 50 for uvb uv .
the products with pa are aimed at uva so that the sunscreen will play a more effective role , often in the case of pa intensity + , and multiple + indicates that effective protection time is extended .
oily skin should choose the more permeable waterproofing products , sun - screen spray is also a good choice .
dry skin should choose frost - like sunscreen products ; neutral skin generally does not strictly provide , sensitive skin abrasive any preservative is a burden , recommends the selection of pure objects to protect the products .
remember to apply sunscreen half an hour in advance because sunscreen requires time to fully penetrate into the skin .
military training is a long time , sunscreen cream every two hours to be able to have a lasting effect , don &apos;t be lazy .
due to the fact that the skin has just been stimulated by the sun , military training is not immediately used in whitening products .
after the military training , it is possible to use a towel to wrap ice in ice-filled ice to slow down the local heat .
during the exhibition period , farmers who purchase farm machines continue to apply cumulative subsidy policies , and farmers purchase farm machines up to 40 % of the subsidy .
this exhibition will be open to global recruiters and , in particular , an increase in the number of invitations extended to countries and target market countries along the area .
this exhibition will strive to complete the contract of signing 60 units , $ 22 billion in import funds and over 160 trade contracts , with a contract value of 3.2 billion yuan .
according to the knowledge , &quot; xiangbo &quot; for seven consecutive years , because of the strong foundation of manufacturing industry in lou xue , hunan province , the history of industrial development has been a long time .
as the host of the &quot; xiangbo association &quot; , lou bottom has established trade relations with more than 90 countries around the world .
xiangbo will become an important platform for local development of specialty industries and driving the specialty industry out of the country &apos;s door .
in some nights , the ionosphere is full of free electrons , which means that radio signals can go further .
the united states air force is interested in replicating this effect , according to the american journal of mass science , aug. 11 .
while a stable free electrons of free electrons can help people listen to the radio station on the margins of a university broadcaster , this may not be the interest of the air force .
the electron-filled ionosphere means that the military &apos;s radio has a wider range of broadcasting , and it may offer some protection for gps signals from the sun &apos;s storm .
the ultimate goal might be to create a series of cube satellites according to demand , which could strengthen the ionosphere as needed .
but above all , the teams that signed contracts with the air force must prove that the scientific principles will work .
industry figures show that coal capacity in 2015 is nearly 6 billion tons , and the country &apos;s coal capacity exceeds 1.8 billion tons .
over the past decade , the state council has issued a total of five notifications of the elimination of surplus and backward capacity .
although the previous four did not target the coal industry , the target industry is directly related to the coal industry .
last november , the 5500 high-powered coal prices in qinhuangdao had long been hovering at 370 yuan / t , and 90 % of coal companies were in a loss .
since february , the price of coal has risen , and the recent qinhuangdao power-coal price has risen four weeks , rising to a 16-month high , up to $ 436 a tonne , up nearly 70 yuan from the start of the year .
as the price picks up , there is concern that a small number of coal mines will not resume production ?
in this regard , china ( hainan ) , the director of the reform of the institute of reform and development , has conducted analysis and interpretation .
qanming : to the production capacity has attracted the attention of all the parties , the report of the coal industry that is released today is indeed a source of concern .
the factors behind the three layers still reflect the fact that our growth patterns have shifted relatively backward in the past , and that the government-led growth has not yet been fundamentally transformed .
second , it is also directly related to the push of local governments , and in the process of capacity-building , funds and accompanying measures are in place , and in this respect the differences in the different regions are actually relatively large .
third , if some of the provinces where the pace of progress is currently slow are to make progress in the second half of the year , they may face greater risks .
under such circumstances , the process of relying on central-prize funding to push back into capacity may have a negative impact .
first , the production capacity is not simply the total volume control .
our aim is to reconstruct the new karma of the whole coal industry by eliminating backward production capacity , promoting structural optimization and reconstructing the whole coal industry .
in the process of deploying capacity , local governments must combine the transition of production capacity and coal industries and develop related services .
second , if we want to finish this year &apos;s production capacity this year , we should give full play to the power of administrative supervision and administrative supervision .
finally , we want to strengthen social security .
since the market is directly concerned with employment , we need to strengthen training in job skills for employees and employees .
the decline was due to the expected deterioration of foreign capital in the medium-term gdp growth of brazil .
in 2015 , brazil &apos;s participation in global direct investment was 3.7 per cent , down from 5.7 per cent in 2014 .
the bank &apos;s international investment attraction index includes four sub-indices : infrastructure , economic outlook , business environment and direct investment .
brazil &apos;s international direct investment in 2015 was $ 64.6 billion , down from $ 73.1 billion in 2014 .
last year , “ greenfield investments ” in brazil were $ 17.9 billion , or 2.1 per cent year-on-year .
&quot; there are 288 green investment projects in brazil , compared with 314 years in 2003-2014 &quot; .
in the first half of 2016 , however , international direct investment in brazil reached $ 33.8 billion , an increase of almost 10 per cent over the same period last year .
title : canadian police killed is supporter : home-made bomb attacks on the city ready to work near the end
the taxi company said the taxi had been moved to daime &apos;s home before the police arrived .
in a press conference wednesday , police in canada said the information received by the police included the &quot; martyr video &quot; provided by the fbi , which will carry out the attack on the young man .
according to the german voice , a man wearing a black barak hat is reading the koran , referring to crimes against muslims , and vowed to launch an attack on a city in canada shortly .
he said in the video that the attack would take place within 72 hours and at rush hours .
the incident was the first time when canadian prime minister justin trudeau came into power last year , and the police first shot terror suspects before they were issued .
after upgrading the renovation of the jinghan grand canal &apos;s main canal branch line of the old wanfu river , the north dairy channel will charge toll fees on september 1 st .
the two tributary channels are subject to reform and construction in the form of social financing , and the fee has been approved by the relevant departments of the provincial government .
the old wanfu river fairway flows through jinxiang , the stock market , via nanyang lake into the main channel of the grand canal , which is 32.5 km long .
according to the requirement of navigation , the old wan fu river channel adopts the method of conservation and transformation , the local water depth is deep , the local bending is straightener , and the navigation conditions can be improved .
the channel flows through jinxiang county , a city , south yanghu into the main channel of the grand canal , 19 kilometers .
construction of two waterway renovation works in february 2011 , completion of commissioning acceptance , investment construction and operation in january 2015 is the center of anping canal logistics service in jining city .
according to the principle of &quot; loan construction and repayment &quot; , the jinping canal logistics service center in jinping city collects channel tolls according to the charge standard approved by the commodity and price bureau of shandong province .
among them , basic tolls are paid at 1.75 per ton / ton , and the mileage toll is paid by 0.05 / km / kilometre .
the toll collection will take effect from 15 june 2016 to 14 june 2019 .
from jining city port authority , the reporter learned that there were four tolls in jianning , respectively , namely , the river waterway , the white horse river course , the north channel , the old huanghe waterway .
four waterways are the tributary channel of the beijing-hangzhou grand canal , and the way of social financing is to be upgraded .
it is the first to adopt the model of &quot; government + market &quot; , which is used in the construction of inland river harbour infrastructure construction in shandong province , the government &apos;s main investment and the financing gap of social funds .
the white-horse river , the old huanghe river , and other feeder channels such as the beidaihe river are the way of pure market operation .
the funds allocated by the state cannot satisfy the need of engineering construction and restrict the progress of course upgrading .
the use of social funds for public infrastructure construction is in line with the requirements of national policies and is also a means of breaking the bottlenecks to finance .
the performance of ningzhi in the semi-finals of the 100m freestyle has left many chinese audiences speechless .
in the 50-meter freestyle pre-match , ningze once more refreshed the people &apos;s &quot; bottom line &quot; .
in fact , the 50-meter freestyle is not the main item in ningzhi , his performance and best achievement on the kangshan world championship , also determined that he is unlikely to make a breakthrough in this project .
indeed , hong kong &apos;s authoritative media , the magazine , revealed that the biggest reason for his failure was that he had lost interest in swimming .
many factors outside the field may have a great impact on his ideas for the future , and now he may be more interested in entering the entertainment circle .
after the kangshan world championship game , ningzhi relied on its superintendency and good achievement , instant become net red .
therefore , &quot; national husband &quot; , &quot; small meat &quot; , &quot; flower-like beauty &quot; and so on also constantly become the label of his body .
all sorts of business activities come up with beautiful money and become a golden thoroughfare .
in this case , ningzer even chose to retire into the entertainment circle at this time , not only his freedom , but also a seemingly feasible path .
after all , he is only 23 years old , after a certain study , can be able to play one or two tv plays with his personality .
but there is a need to look at ningzer , who is not qualified enough to compare with these predecessors ?
at the 2000 sydney olympics , liu xuan , 21 , had come to the end of his career .
liu xuan &apos;s beautiful appearance made her quick to remember and lay the foundation for her future into the entertainment circle .
after his retirement , liu xuan played a number of tv shows and set up his own studio in 2013 .
tian liang participated in the two olympic games of the single pair of the 10m race , and obtained 2 gold and 2 silver .
but after losing his teammates in the 2004 olympic singles ten-meter race , tian liang &apos;s athletic state declined and was shot out of the water team .
and he and his daughter attend the variety show &quot; daddy to where &quot; , more to let him foot in the eye .
once the gymnastics gold a generation of yang wei , li xiaopeng and chen an ice to participate in all kinds of variety shows .
it is worth mentioning that yang wei li xiaopeng then led china to win the 2008 olympic league champion , yang wei , two times to win the individual full gold medal , known as almighty wang .
chen an ice , meanwhile , led china to the 2012 olympic group champion , and became king of the crane .
but after a gold medal in london &apos;s olympic games , chen ice &apos;s move , also let him in the innumerable .
but the main energy of these athletes is still in the game , and for the variety show is just like dragonfly .
however , whether retired or active , can get the entertainment circle &apos;s favour all need to be able to get out of hand .
after all , athletes step into a new field , both the ability and the pulse , is a blank state .
even in tian liang , liu xuan , who spent many years in the entertainment industry for many years , raised them with ordinary viewers , much more thought of their performance at the olympics .
and yang wei , li xiaopeng and other new people , in the competition show show , without exception is &quot; olympic champion &quot; .
compared to some of the above , ningzhi a champion of the championship title is still slightly thin .
moreover , compared to tian liang , liu xuan , yang wei and others , the negative impact on its image is probably inestimable if it is 23 years old .
after all , bringing up the athletes , people &apos;s demands are &quot; invincible , but there is no fear of hardship , &quot; ning tao is still a lot worse than this .
ten thousand paces to say , ningzhi is handsome , completely can rely on the face value to get the support of thousands of brain powder .
it &apos;s not a bit of a function , just looks , you want to be mixed up in the entertainment circle , it &apos;s not so much easier to train than to get back to it .
the choice of life is entirely personal will , but how to choose , ningztao should have a number in mind .
on the surface , network social platforms expand the communication circle and reduce people &apos;s sense of isolation .
the power of network society is becoming more and more extensive , not only gradually replacing the traditional telephone contact , even into the real life circle on the line , quietly changing the social life of the present people .
the benefits of online society are obvious , such as convenience and convenience , and are particularly vulnerable to young people .
according to a survey of social habits for older students , 57 percent of college students use their mobile phones for more than five hours a day , and the basic &quot; machines do not go away &quot; .

after the next water , 165 centimeters tall , huang eileen found that she did not go to the end !
before it looks calm , underneath it is a stream !
but she did not hesitate to swim to the little girl .
huang eileen said that the river is muddy , fast , less than 5 m distance , almost polished all her strength .
she made every effort to push the little girl over to the bank . &quot; the slope is so slippery that i am afraid i have no strength to sink in . &quot;

as a result of being forced , huang eileen seldom took the initiative again after he learned to swim , &quot; she did not think of the skill . &quot;

but they grow extremely slowly , sometimes about 1 cm in a year , suggesting that greenland sharks may have extra life .
traditional methods of testing usually use animal calcification tissue , and some sharks may use fin ridges , but this calcification organization is scant in shark sharks .
a new study led by the university of copenhagen in copenhagen , yulus nielsen , has turned to radionuclides in the eye of the eye of a shark in greenland .
the method had previously been used to measure the age of whales , but it was the first time to determine the age of fish such as sharks .
their analysis shows that the largest life expectancy at this point is 392 years , with an error of 120 years .
that is to say , the shark is at least 272 years old and is likely to reach the age of 512 .
in addition , the female superintendent of greenland is said to be able to mature at about 4 m long enough to convert into age at least until the age of 156 .
as a result , researchers wrote in their paper that the moss of greenland is known to be the earth &apos;s known , longest-lived vertebrate , exceeding the previous long-lived champion baleen whale ( 211 years old ) .

in late august , prime minister shinzo abe will go to kenya to attend the sixth african development conference , according to china &apos;s voice of the news .
the african development conference was led by japan , and the five previous meetings were held in tokyo or yokohama , japan , and this meeting will also be for the first time in africa .
officials from the ministry of foreign affairs of japan have said that the convening of a meeting on the ground in africa has helped to draw the attention of africa and european countries to japan .
in conjunction with mr abe &apos;s trip , the japan national liberal party will send its team to the countries concerned .
japan &apos;s &quot; entry to the ordinary &quot; journey began in the early 1990s , and the african development conference , launched by japan , started in 1993 , which is no coincidence !
africa , which has 53 seats in the united nations , is an important vote for the united nations , and japan wants to be &quot; infused &quot; , and how can africa abandon africa ?
exchanges of views will also be exchanged with national stakeholders on the islamic state of extremist organizations and the response to terrorist activities .
the &quot; western group &quot; will visit seven countries , including sierra leone , liberia and guinea-bissau .

abe has announced that , in order to stabilize the country ’ s stability in sub-saharan africa , it will provide 100 billion yen ( 6.1 billion yuan ) in five years .
it is widely felt by observers that japan has always been generous to africa for two main purposes : to increase japan &apos;s presence in africa ; and to seek the support of african countries on the issue of accession .
&quot; from the political side , africa is relatively underdeveloped , but the number of countries is relatively high , japan has always regarded it as the so-called &apos; big box &apos; , &apos; mr. yang bo , an expert on japan &apos;s questions , said .
japan will not give up in the future , nor will the work on africa end in this way .
economic aspects , because japan &apos;s production capacity is strong , but the domestic market is relatively limited , especially at present in the context of sub-saharan aging , domestic demand is relatively low .
however , from junichiro , 10 years ago , to abe , 10 years later , japan has repeatedly launched a &quot; sprint &quot; , but all the time .
japan &apos;s expert , yang bujiang , thinks that japan &apos;s initial intention is clear , but the road to travel is bound to be difficult .
japan needs to have a good relationship with its neighbors , regardless of geopolitical rivalry or national disputes and historical understanding , and japan needs to have a right attitude .

there are also such a group of star coaches in china , who have won numerous glory for the country in the days of the olympic games , and have taught them how many years have passed since they were retired , and they have been trained to win the championship .
as china &apos;s first world champion of gymnastics , huang yu-bin chose to pick up the whip after his retirement .
from the women &apos;s coach to the men &apos;s team coach , then coach , huang yuanbin created an &quot; olympic gold ball &quot; , a more team in the beijing olympic games got 9 gold 1 silver 4 bronze in the myth .
since then , tian liang has always been advertising for pronouncements , especially in recent years has played the important role of &quot; bulldog &quot; and &quot; lei feng &quot; .
many nba players have proved their strength . but there has been some decline in progress .
either because of age or limitation of time , there will be a retreat in each season for some players .
of course , some “ step back ” may be just a decline in data , which may not have fallen .
even if wade is one of the best scorecards in the league , he shouldn &apos;t have had a hot fire at the bull &apos;s performance .
he and the long range of the rear range were limited , and the third fatality rate for the star butler was only 32.8 % , which would make it very crowded next season .
come to the wind city , the flash man is sure to give the ball more to butler and rondo , oneself most likely in the regular season chooses to breed law .
o &apos;carrefour &apos;s situation is more embarrassing , as the first choice of 76 people last season , he had to compete with simmons in the new season and with mr. simmons as well as with mr. ender .
this competition may not be forthcoming , simmons also needs to adapt to the nba , and wayne is recovering from injury as soon as possible , but oakafu is still a problem in the 76-man-long .
last season , 32 % of oakoff scores came from lower offensives , a higher percentage than cincinnus , vukovich and brooke lopez , while his use rates were 40 % higher .
with sims already showing an excellent ball forward potential , nbed also has a better fit for nba games , and the status of oakford is likely to be so shaky .
over the past two seasons , thompson &apos;s use has stabilized at the league table 20 , the best two seasons in his life .
but the question is , with the arrival of durant , thompson &apos;s use will certainly fall , which will affect his performance .
the effect of this effect will be not only the number of hand-outs , but also a significant reduction in the next season , which will certainly reduce the difficulty for his opponents in some ways .
the arrival of durant will make the team &apos;s players shrink , but the worst is likely to be thompson .
but this does not mean a drop in the level of the mind , which is more like the sacrifice he made for the team .
parker &apos;s performance in the last season was better than the figures , not only because of his high basketball efficiency , but also his chemical reaction to alderic &apos;s chemical reaction .
duncan retired , and ginobili declared war for another year , and the combined gdp portfolio eventually came to an end and was the youngest of the three , and there was not much oil in the tanks of the french sports car .
after winning the third championship , jábal , jordan and russell have won more regular game mvp , and jordan is the only man in the fmvp than james .
oh , by the way , james just gave cleveland a prize for the first professional athletic championship in the past 52 years .
james , who has come to work for the 14th season of his career , needs better assurance and preparation for the playoffs .
therefore , in the regular season , james &apos;s data are likely to fall further and he will pay more weight to owen , but he will still be easily a third player in the league .
&quot; we must build the talent that has been learned from the home in russia &quot; .
on the local day of the day , huang jing , chairman of the chinese federation of moscow chinese federation , said he was excited when he saw the xinhua news reporter .
shortly before , she participated in a training course on chinese talent ( calligraphy , painting ) , hosted by the chinese state council office of the chinese state council and hosted by the university of southern china .
when i attended the training course , i was completely unaware of where the painting had come from and , as a result , at the end of the course , he had been able to draw and write his own work .
after returning to moscow , we must use the knowledge and skills acquired to make our contribution to the spread and promotion of chinese culture .
the secretary-general of the russian society for the promotion of chinese culture , which participated in the training course , shared the same feeling .
she said she had made great progress with the help of the instructor and felt that it was the responsibility of the chinese culture overseas .
yan wei said that , after going back to russia the traditional chinese culture should be spread and spread among the chinese and the russians who love chinese culture .

the british team won the silver medal in the seven-person football game and the fijians won the gold medal
in a seven-man football final on thursday night , england failed to perform well before fijians , which was defeated by the fijians at 43 to 7 at the rio tiantio stadium .
it was the first olympic medal in the country &apos;s history to win the gold medal by winning , breaking , disqualification , matching , running and power .
silver medals were also a small comfort for the defeated england team , which was the third silver medal on the day of the british delegation , which was enough to make the british football team proud that they had defeated new zealand , argentina and south africa on the way to the seven-man football game for the first time in the olympics .
earlier in the day , the british team scored seven to five , which could affect their performance in the finals .
but in any case , fijians today are enough to defeat a full 15-player team .
tomorrow , at least one of the britons will wear a gold medal , which may be a comfort for the british team , but probably not . the englishman is ben ryan , the head coach of wembley , who served as head coach of the british team .
it is not easy for england to make today &apos;s achievement .
eight years ago , at ryan &apos;s dedication , they did not have a chance to win an international seven-man football game in adelli .
now , they are just one step away from the championship .
despite their tremendous blows , they have also made remarkable progress .
fijian has the advantage of having an advantage in making england unattractive .
for tom mitchell and his teammates , it was like a string of moving buses , and the world &apos;s championship team was already ahead of a 5-0 margin when it came into the corner flag .
the game lasted only four minutes , and jerry schema scored again right on the right .
the british team barely touched the ball .
mitchell &apos;s strength cut the giant &apos;s usual lyon calva without a third score , but it merely slowed the pace of fiji &apos;s score .
in seven minutes , azar weremaru was in the right corner . 17 to 0 , the british team added insult to injury .
the carrava scored another point , and the game ... there &apos;s one minute left in the first half of the game .
then wattmo lavrov broke through england &apos;s defense and went straight to the line .
when the midfielder is resting , the score is 29 to 0 .
fijians seem to be born to play seven people for rugby , while the british team is still out of the mahogany .
that &apos;s the case .
the british team made a huge change in the second half and hit fijians off the line for four minutes , and the performance was fine for the first half , but after a wonderful match from the fijians , joshua tuesowa scored again .
dan norton , who created a chance to score for the british team , tentatively changed to 36 to 7 in the left corner , but the game was already under the control of the south sea island , where their fans sang , waved flags and danced in the platform .
the wonderful performance of the fijians was very impressive .
marta williams stopped at the last minute of an uncalled attack by fijians .
the final whistle sounded , the fijians embraced , and the defeated england only regretted the retreat .
earlier in the day , fijians beat japan in the semifinal in 20 to 5 , and britain was in a hot semi-final against south africa .
in the first half , kyle brown helped the south to get ahead , but dan norton scored in the second half with an excellent footpath .
after that , the england team anthony &apos;s brother , marcus watson , used a wonderful interception to ensure the team &apos;s victory , and the british team won the silver medal .
helen graf and heather steinen are encouraged by a cancer coach who won gold medals in rowing
it is no exaggeration to say that this is the most touching gold medal .
from the first row to the present , helen graf and heather steinen have received 220 punitive pullout training , and their gold medal in estacio da lagoa has a more remarkable significance .
though only two of them were oars , there was a man , coach robin williams , who had been accompanying them to the second woman &apos;s double-medal gold medal , the first pair of women to meet this height .
they have maintained 39 unbeaten records and have an absolute advantage .
what we have seen is that the two gifted players walk on the surface of the water , but this is not the whole victory .
there is a lot of volunteers behind each rowing gold medal , and it is their constant dedication to create different things , and the greatest of these is the fact that one of them , 30 months ago , knew that he was suffering from cancer and did not know whether he could live to see the day coach .
as he said , death may come at any moment .
i got bladder cancer . they performed the operation for me .
if surgery is not performed , cancer cells spread all over the body .
in this way , the situation would be much worse .
it will change your mind slightly .
williams was diagnosed with cancer in december 2013 .
fortunately , he started treatment at the beginning of 2014 and minimizes the impact , although it may not be appropriate to say so in such circumstances .
i need to get my salary , so i have to get up quickly .
it was an incentive for me .
i live in the hospital , although they say a few steps will be enough , but i walk around 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet in a ward .
that is all the starting point .
rowing itself is a journey , and this has made this journey a bit longer .
at the moment of gold , they first thought of williams , who was slightly more talkative than usual this morning in order to overcome his anxiety .
&quot; i am in a bad mood this week may be a bit of an extreme , but this is a real gold medal , &quot; she said . &quot; i &apos;m not in a good mood this week , &quot; she said .
it repeatedly told me how important it was for me , and how much i worked for helen and robin .
this is helen , robin and i have worked for three years in return .
if there were no robin , we were just a nobody . thank him very much . he &apos;s the best coach in the world .
i couldn &apos;t find a better trainer and coach than him .
helen graf and heather steinen have failed in five years .
this combination of penalties is unmatched by their opponents .
even at the close of the last 500 m , nz and the danish team began approaching , stanning and graf still have plenty of physical reserves .
it was a real shock at the time .
helen called : &quot; keep pace and keep pace . &quot;
it is very important not to be influenced by your opponent .
we have a good start , and we &apos;re not looking forward to doing something amazing .
we did not think of today &apos;s glory , we were only thinking of each oar and winning the game , and we did it .
it took a year for the portfolio to determine its future .
graf will marry television explorer steve baxel next month .
but now , she just wants to enjoy the present .
i don &apos;t want to say that this is my last game .
this will bring me too much pressure .
in london , i took about six months to realize i was the olympic champion .
it is a completely new experience , and i feel very nervous .
it has now been about four minutes .
she said , &quot; i feel much better . &quot;

the &quot; animosity &quot; of snapchat is referred to as the satire of asians
snapchat suggests that this filter is inspired by animation , but some observers think it has a racial color .
snapchat &apos;s 150 million day-to-day users can change reality and become ridiculous through their filter tools .
you can turn yourself into a pineapple , a dog or a roy lysenstein painting .
these lenses have the effect of passivation and bending characteristics , producing more than 30 million patches a day .
any mistake will be brought to the attention of the public at once .
snapchat lens has been criticized , the application is called agitation to play black or white skin as beauty .
therefore , when the application provides a filter for some users this week to create oblique eyes , blame teeth and face effects , some commentators call it a racial satire of asian &quot; yellow &quot; .
they even think that these recurring problems mean that the company has a bigger problem with diversity .
on wednesday , the report of the verge and motherboard sparked outrage , after snapchat said it deleted it .
the company &apos;s explanation is that the filter is a tribute to anime characters rather than satire asians .
but for observers who have experienced racism , the filters remind them of the damaging stereotypes in reality .
others are also firmly opposed to these anime images .
a korean-american art , which has been launched against these photos and widely shared , said in an e-mail that the filters were &quot; at least uncomfortable and uncomfortable &quot; .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to distinguish between extremely disgusting asian satirical images and filters , &quot; she said .
although not only the yellow species in the filter , the yellow species are extremely demeaning .
snapchat is not the only company that touches these cultural lines .
from the company &apos;s board of directors to hollywood and the equipment we carry , american culture seems to be promoting diversity and inclusiveness .
the large group of young people in snapchat is likely to be very sensitive due to a greater emphasis on race diversity than older ones .
when snapchat &apos;s filter produces an image of an insult to the user , zhu cathy , 25 , said in an interview on thursday : &quot; this kind of thing is more difficult to escape from people than before . &quot;
ms. zhu , who acted as product manager and engineer on thursday , decided to delete her snapchat account and encourage others to do the same .
in an article written for writing and a telephone interview , she said she thought racial controversy reflected the lack of ethnic diversity in the recruitment process .
ms. zhu criticized the company &apos;s employees for the majority of its employees , all of which were male and at the end of the article a tag : # deletesnapchat .
as a chinese-american , ms zhu said : &quot; there are no different species of people in their staff , so they can make such a decision , or that they have some coloured people in their employees , but their jobs will not allow them to speak freely . &quot;
other observers shared her complaint that she had not been answered by snapchat .
the company did not publish data on employee diversity and said it was a private company .
on thursday , snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic background of his employees , but a spokesman said the company had recently hired a recruiter to focus on people with low internal rates and promote internal inclusiveness .
ms. zhu said she would close her snapchat account : &quot; i wonder if they need more people who oppose this behavior like ours . &quot;
the congressional team said military officials distorted isis intelligence
in a report released on thursday , a congressional team said officials of the central command of the united states changed the intelligence report and would be more optimistic about iraq and syria ’ s war on the islamic state ’ s war against the islamic state .
the midterm report comes from a dedicated working group organized by the house military committee , the intelligence committee and the republican party of the house of representatives partial defence sub-committee , which states that the central headquarters intelligence analyst is &quot; widely dissatisfied &quot; , who said that their superiors are tampering with their assessment of the battle between the united states and the islamic state .
central command , located in tampa , florida , is the military headquarters responsible for supervising u.s. military operations in the middle east and central asia .
according to a news report on the report , &quot; the intelligence described by senior leaders of the central command has been more optimistic about us counter-terrorism actions than the actual situation , and is always more optimistic than the analysis of other intelligence agencies . &quot;
&quot; the behavior of the central headquarters is difficult to accept , &quot; said the republican representative in california : &quot; our soldiers are suffering from war and the other is the wrong analysis of high-level policymakers . &quot;
the leadership of the central command has been extended to the highest level of the agency .
the report details the long-standing problems of the 2014 and 2015 central headquarters in describing and analysing the training of the iraqi army in the united states .
although there is no conclusive evidence that senior officials of the obama administration have ordered the change of these reports , according to the description of the report , the analysts feel themselves under pressure from the leadership of the central command to give more optimism to the threat of the islamic state ( isis or isil ) .
&quot; in the first half of 2015 , many central headquarters press releases , statements and congressional testimonies are much more optimistic than the actual situation , &quot; the report said .
one central headquarters official , for example , publicly said it was likely to take a large-scale military operation to recapture mosul in april or may 2015 .
mosul , the second largest city of iraq , is still under the control of isis .
&quot; after months of investigation , the results have been clear , &quot; said mike pompero , a republican delegate in kansas .
from mid-2014 to mid-2015 , most senior intelligence officials at the central command of the united states manipulated the command of the headquarters and concealed the threat from isis .
the republican party had learned from the analyst that information about the islamic state had been manipulated and a special working group had been set up .
as the survey continues , more discoveries will be made following the report released on thursday .
the attorney general of the ministry of defence also conducted a long-term survey of the central command .
democratic members of the house intelligence committee posted their findings on thursday and were in line with some of the findings of the republican convention .
in a statement , the democratic leader of the democratic party said in a statement that , between 2014 and 2015 , the central headquarters developed an overly narrow flow of intelligence assessments of isis and iraqi peacekeeping forces .
mr sharif said the process &quot; hindered the release of intelligence &quot; and lowered the morale of the analyst and &quot; could not accept different opinions . &quot;
but mr cianta and democrats also said they did not find any evidence that the white house had tried to put pressure on analysts from the central headquarters so that their conclusions were consistent with &quot; presupposition or political narratives . &quot;
the beast daily reported the preliminary results of congressional investigations on tuesday .
last august , the new york times reported that after receiving a complaint from the central command analysts , the general prosecutor of the pentagon began an investigation .
pentagon spokesman lieutenant patrick evans said in a statement that the ministry of defence did not comment on the congressional report until the investigation of the attorney general was completed .
&quot; experts sometimes disagree over complex data and intelligence agencies and the ministry of defence encourage healthy dialogue on these important national security themes , &quot; he said .
the impact of the survey has exceeded the success of united states-led bombing operations in iraq and syria ( which are increasingly claimed by ministry officials ) .
but last year , they raised public questions about the extent to which president obama could trust the assessment of military operations in iraq , afghanistan , libya and other crisis areas issued by the central command .
the criticism of the islamic situation is reminiscent of the controversy over a decade ago when the cia intelligence analyst , gregory huck , wrote an article stating that george w. bush ’ s administration , despite the many analysts ’ objections , insisted that small-scale troops be deployed to iraq and that little consideration was given to the post-invasion circumstances of 2003 .
mr. huck played a key role in this campaign against the islamic situation .
last year , officials said that mr. huck &apos;s team had concluded that air strikes against islamic state refineries did not significantly reduce the economic revenues of terrorist organizations , as the terrorist organization had constructed temporary refineries to continue to sell oil on the black market , unlike the declared statement .
according to the september report of time weekly , the central command did not publish the findings .
the head of the central headquarters , lloyd austin iii , was criticized in the past year , after several lawyers examined the senate &apos;s testimony about an overly optimistic assessment of the war .
general austin was retired in april and is currently replaced by joseph vettle in the position of the central command .
the united states win four wins in the women &apos;s hockey game and will compete with britain
katie baum , who was the only third in the game against japan in the 6-1 win over japan , was the first us women &apos;s hockey team to take the lead on thursday to help the united states win over the indian team with a 3-0 victory over india .
the two games were stunned by five goals , but the 27-year-old said she did not know that she had done so well .
&quot; i know nothing about it , &quot; she said .
i &apos;m not the kind of person who will remember that i have been in several balls .
what she knows is that the us team has won four wins in the olympics and will compete with the team on thursday &apos;s 2-0 win over japan .
britain and the united states meet in the first round of the first round on saturday .
both teams are in the finals of the four-fifths , which will determine who will appear in the panel &apos;s first identity .
the team &apos;s first team will avoid having a strong dutch team , so it will go further . the dutch team is out on the first line of another team .
in the game on saturday , the united states created wonders with amazing performance , knowing that at the london olympics four years ago , the us team mattered out of 12 teams .
baram was also in the same team at that time .
baram grew up in brookings , pennsylvania , and picked up hockey sticks for the first time in the age of three ( her twin sister was engaged in the campaign in draksel ) and joined the national team at the age of 16 , becoming the youngest member of the national team to date .
she missed the 2008 olympic games by failing to be included in the final list .
she and her teammates were not bullish in 2012 .
the following year , british craig pynum was the manager and all began to change .
&quot; this is a cultural , mental and substantive change , &quot; he said .
we haven &apos;t reached the current level in london .
we came to the bottom of the bottom .
on thursday night , baram first raised his head in the first half against a close - back shot at the door .
the team did not taste the fruit in the current game , but the team showed incredible resilience and kept a 1-0 ratio close to the end of the third quarter , when bum broke out .
she took the ball to the left side of the stadium , followed by the middle road , smoked into the net , the united states 2 is ahead of 0 .
melissa gonzalez scored the last goal in the middle of the fourth quarter .
america &apos;s first zero match for the goalkeeper jie brighis is in the first three games and in the first three games the opponent scored one goal .
this time she was overrun .
baram too .
&quot; we are in good shape now , &quot; says mr patham . but how much better depends on saturday &apos;s outcome .
food of cold and sour during the great depression
in march 1933 , franklin delano roosevelt , who had just been elected president , sat in the office for lunch .
as a gourmet , president roosevelt loved fifth avenue delicacies , such as goose heips and maryland stewed fish .
that day his menu was simple : tomato sauce devils eggs , mashed potatoes and pudding for dessert .
jean ziegman says : &quot; this is for the sake of food and the people suffering . &quot;
her husband , andrew cohen , added : &quot; this also reflects the way americans eat . &quot;
the couple living in the brooklyn highlands were a food historian .
mr. koch &apos;s last book , &quot; fried chenpodge &quot; , is about chinese food , and ms. zigman describes the life of a slum tenant through food in her book 97 orchard .
the new book , which they co-wrote , will be published on tuesday by harper house , is about the history of food in the united states during the great depression .
after showcasing common insights on some foods , they met a journalist at the sandwich store in eisenberg . the simple lunch counter in the ironing area had been open since the 1929 economy was routed .
ms. zigman , 54 , ordered a cream cheese to mix olive sandwiches , while mr. koo , 57 , ordered a turkey , mashed potatoes and vegetables .
the reporter ordered a piece of baking , which couples think these dishes are suitable for discussing the diet during the depression .
&quot; bread was very popular at that time , &quot; ms. zigman said .
there were peanut bread , liver bread and soya bread .
they are made of a raw material and a cheap gate able to feed on raw materials .
imagine that your dinner is peanuts .
mr. koo made a strange appearance .
&quot; they &apos;re just like lead in your stomach , &quot; he said .
in the years leading up to the great depression , middleton is a buffet , especially in the suburbs .
a group of women cooked meals for men &apos;s farm workers , breakfast , lunch and dinner .
in the first battle , americans gave food to the hungry europeans . the foods of foods documented how the country suddenly ceased to be a rich place .
mr. koo explained why he and his wife were going to write the book : &quot; at that time , food had become a major distraction for americans . &quot;
another unhappy topic is the new food of childish : bread and stew , which is the best food for cooking , and stews are &quot; the best way to cook food &quot; , ms. zigman says , because the cooks can use cream to cover up the raw materials in the sauce .
fresh fruits are replaced by cheap dried fruits .
meat has become a rare luxury in the american dining table for many years .
surprisingly large chunks consider only calories and are more likely to be nutrition than taste , or even basic culinary knowledge .
in the study of the book , including a variety of recipes , ms. ziegman prepared a roasted onions filled with peanut butter .
&quot; this is not common at the dinner table , &quot; mr. koko said .
&quot; this is too strange , &quot; ms. ziegman said .
peanut oil and roasted onions simply do not match .
this is a feature of many household economic meals .
family economists have influenced eating habits in the country , such as louis stanley , who was the main cook in the federal home economics agency from 1923 to 1943 , which is unprecedented in history .
they publish recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , encourage women to &quot; finely calculate &quot; and brag to turn the cream of pasta , the carrots , etc . , into gourmet foods .
fengsheng large meal is a plentiful &quot; historical delicacy &quot; .
especially worth it is the government &apos;s response to the hungry people like herbert hoover , president of the president , and i am not in a position to take care of it .
although he publicly praised the simple iowa farmhouse in childhood , his diet was as fine as a millionaire .
mr koo said : &quot; he likes to eat european food such as fish with cucumber sauce . &quot;
he wore an evening gown and served in a gilded dining-room .
he was evidently disconnected from the people .
if not his wife eleanor encouraged him to set an example in his diet , president roosevelt might make the same mistake .
as the book says , the housekeeper employed by ms. roosevelt is not interested in the taste , so the white house food is not only the hardest food in washington , but also the worst food for cooking .
when the united states returns to formal , many of the great depression stages of cooking are discarded .
ms zigman says that what remains is our attention to calories and nutrition and to applying science to cooking .
when the couple said they were writing the book , they learned more about the diet of ms. ziegman &apos;s mother , for example how she didn &apos;t discard food .
&quot; she is very afraid of wasting food , &quot; said mr. coke .
ms zigman recalls : &quot; she actually makes a lot of life sick . &quot;
for example , there was once a &quot; cream puff &quot; incident .
after removing the dishes , she and mr. koo took out a piece of dessert they were preparing at home : this was the fruit that president roosevelt had eaten in his lunch .
&quot; this is called the cream fruit , &quot; added ms. ziegman , adding that the name of a new tide is the &quot; usual trick &quot; for an ordinary dish .
there is no creamy in this dessert , only fruit , flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone was reluctant to put the spoils into thick , brown paste .
unexpectedly , the sweet taste is good .
mr. coke ate a second spoon and a third spoon .
he thought it was an acceptable dessert and told his wife : &quot; it would be much better to chop the walnuts . &quot;
unfortunately , the latest annual report of opec shows that the production of crude oil continues to increase in july , with saudi production reaching a new high .
the report does not ban the market &apos;s credibility with the credibility of opec , and the road to oil recovery is still strewn with thorns .
on monday , the head of the opec presidency and the minister of energy of qatar said opec will hold an informal meeting during the international energy forum , 26-28 september .
the monthly report released by opec on wednesday showed that all opec &apos;s production in july , including gabon , rose 46,000 barrels per day / day to 311,300 barrels / days .
opec also said in its monthly report that low crude prices have driven global refiners to produce more refined oils , adding to the oversupply of the market .
thanks to the news , combined with an increase in oil production in the united states and unexpected increases in crude oil inventories , international oil prices fall two days in a row .
prices fell 2.48 per cent in september for lightweight crude-oil futures , which were delivered in september , falling 2.07 per cent in october , according to the new york mercantile exchange , which ended on wednesday .
reuters is of the opinion that the proposed oil-producing country conference is unlikely to tighten the supply , and that figures released by the u. s. energy information agency are also putting pressure on the market .
iran &apos;s official news agency fars said wednesday that iranian oil production was up to 385,000 barrels a day , the highest level since 2008 .
as news of the meeting emerged , russia &apos;s energy minister , novak , said there was no need for a new round of frozen production in the current price of oil .
the last oil-producing country has been meeting for april , and opec members have failed to agree on any measure .
&apos;the market and the media are likely to overreact to opec &apos;s meeting , &apos; says emma richards , an oil and gas analyst at bmiresearch .
helima croft , chief commodity strategist at royal bank of canada , said opec was releasing them to change the mood of the market by releasing them .
it is like the smoke and mirror of the eye of the eye ( which deliberately misses the impression ) .
eugen weinberg , head of commodity research at commercial banks in germany , said it was believed that the likelihood of opec trying to stabilize the market through the september meeting was low .
this is likely to further undermine the confidence of the market in opec , after which the &quot; wolf comes &quot; .
a number of medical institutions that report the violation of medical advertisements , complaints and reports should be used as spot checks by medical institutions who have been repeatedly punished .
the national health planning commission and the state administration of medicine administration will , in due course , organize supervision over specific supervision and inspection work in some provinces .
according to media disclosures , due to the massive influx of capital into the internet , the problem of current product homogenization is serious , and investment boom is decreasing , and capital enters the waiting period .
according to data from the hospital management research center in hong kong , internet medical companies in one year of business are dying and about 20 % of the start-up internet-based healthcare companies have ceased to exist .
however , just as most of the internet-based healthcare companies are struggling to raise money on the aaa or b round , several subdivision companies still have access to capital fever .
it seems that the internet medical start-up should not be a &quot; wasp &quot; , but rather to look at the market demand , subdued the heart of the mind , deep .
the fish leapt over 120 million yuan , accounting for 40 % of the registered capital , and 9 state-to-state equipment companies at 18.00 million yuan , accounting for 60 % of the registered capital .
in recent years , as the state &apos;s policy support , electronic and centralized supply chain management system has gradually entered various hospitals .
this leaps and kyushu cooperation are aimed at market demand , help hospitals build up the advanced supply chain management system , and take this opportunity to seek more cooperation .
unlike many internet-based medical companies , the ibaby was initially focused on the vertical areas of internet obstetrics , prawns and doctors .
pregnant mothers are not only free for 24 hours and one-to-one competent doctors , but also pay targeted medical attention .
at the doctor &apos;s end , ibaby has broken the geographical limits by organizing online lectures , peer-to-peer , case-based discussions , etc. from grass-roots doctors through organizing specialists .
at present , three plates are opened at the doctor &apos;s end , while doctors continue to educate doctors , doctors , and doctors .
offers include online learning , case studies , academic exchanges ; social platforms for hospitals , doctors with doctors , legal aid , entrepreneurial support and other services for medical and personal life .
according to media reports , ceo wang lei recently said that ali &apos;s health &quot; willing to sink down to the heart &quot; to take the health data .
internet companies , data companies lack professionalism , and in the same language the writing method is not uniform .
ali &apos;s current distribution in the medical and health fields is divided into three sections : ali &apos;s health , the world cat &apos;s medicine museum and paypal &apos;s future hospital .
wang said that health-care entrepreneurship would be harder than any other profession , &quot; it &apos;s not just how much money is there , it &apos;s going to be a bit more thoughtful and slow to do it , &quot; he said .
to stay up and stay up the night and watch the olympic games easy to damage the heart
brazil &apos;s olympic games are in full swing , and many citizens will stay up late even when the event is broadcast in half a night .
in response , doctors are particularly reminded that staying up at night is a health hazard and can trigger cardiovascular disease .
if you stay up late for a long time , the hormone will still secrete a large amount of secretion , and the person is still in a state of intense excitement , unable to get a normal recovery , can cause vascular shrinkage and increase blood pressure , leading to cardiovascular disease .
people with high blood pressure , high blood sugar , high blood fat , smoking habits , family history and other cardiovascular risk factors can be more likely to cause cardiovascular disease if they stay up late .
if you stay up late for long periods of time , not only cardiovascular function , but also gastrointestinal function , immune system , neuroendocrine system will be affected , and even the risk of tumor increases .
for old friends , han zhongzhi suggested that try not to stay up late for the olympics , especially groups with a history of cardiovascular disease .
during the last world cup soccer game , han xingzhi attended a 60-year-old patient who had been involved in the initiation of myocardial infarction or was associated with a stay-at-the-clock competition .
mr. han said he has received some 25-year-old myocardial infarction or brain-affected patients since the beginning of this year , which is largely due to the long-staying lifestyle of the patient .
1 . don &apos;t stay up every day , occasionally stay up and watch the favorite sports items , and others may wish to watch the game re-play the next day .
2 . stay up late in time to replenish moisture , eat more fruit , prevent the congestion of blood vessels , increase the body immunity .

during the cold war , the soviet union imported missiles into cuba , which almost led to a nuclear war in the united states of america .
this event was seen as the culmination of the cold war , known as the &quot; cuban missile crisis &quot; .
but it is little known that , during the cold war , a strong solar storm caused the united states to launch a nuclear war against the soviet union , which was not released for the first time by researchers until 9 august .
on may 23 , 1967 , a strong solar storm caused intense interference in the us military &apos;s radar and radio communications in the arctic .
these radars are part of the u.s. ballistic missile warning system to monitor soviet missiles .
the paper , which was completed by researchers from the university of colorado in the united states , interviewed american military personnel involved in forecasting and analysing solar activities and consulted non-confidential literature .
in the 1960s , the united states air force had always had a part of the united states air force that flew into the sky in order to prevent a sudden nuclear war in the soviet union .
the u. s. military commander did not know the main culprit of this disturbance was the solar storm , rather than the soviet union , and ordered the fighters to enter the combat readiness .
fortunately , the u. s. military has finally stopped the potential military conflict since the end of the 1950s , which began with solar activity and its research on electromagnetic interference with the earth .
later , he summarized the information provided by the united states air force aviation meteorological service and submitted a detailed report .
the direct result of this solar storm is that the u.s. military has since viewed the space weather as a combat concern and has built a stronger space weather forecasting system .

as long as there is microtrust in the community , it can be easy to operate on its own , which makes it easier for both sides to &quot; meet &quot; , ease the problem of parking and reduce traffic accident cases .
on the other hand , the xi &apos;an administration said that the traffic police will take different disposal measures according to the actual situation , depending on the situation .

on april 27 , 2015 , the united states and japan jointly issued a new edition of the us-japan defense cooperation guidelines in new york , allowing the japanese armed forces to play a more offensive role in the global arena .
it was the same day in new york , us secretary of defense carter , secretary of state of secretary of state john kerry , the minister for foreign affairs of japan and the minister of defence of japan in new york .
this is the fifth time that china &apos;s civilian think tank released the japanese military assessment report , is also the fourth launch version of the english version .
the report is divided into nine chapters , including general policy adjustments , military strength , defence budget , military deployment , weaponry and equipment , institutional reform , military training , military security cooperation in the country , and military security relations in china .
according to the report , the year 2015 is the year for which the government has pushed forward significant policy adjustments in the security sector for several years in a row .
since then , japan &apos;s initiatives in the area of security will be primarily operational at the operational level of the application of the rule of law , strategy implementation and policy implementation , rather than the substantial adjustments and changes in the framework , mechanisms and policies .
the report stresses that the cabinet attempts to push forward japan &apos;s &quot; normal nationalization &quot; through the above three-point breakthroughs , and that the self-defense forces walk out into international security affairs , strengthen the alliance of japan and the united states , and prevent the multiple objectives of china &apos;s anti-china development .

the financial times issued a map of the residence of the us ambassador to china on august 12 .

the mansion is grey , with a perimeter fence , a second-tier interior wall , barbed wire and vehicle roadblocks .
to complement public sports facilities
the black coal depot was turned into a &quot; green grass like a &quot; footballer ; the red-brick factory was turned into a modern sports house .
on the day of the national fitness day , hangzhou xiangjiang outside the south of xiangjiang sports culture park , opened the mysterious veil .
this is a coal field , closed after more than ten years ago , has been idle , leaving a large number of illegal buildings and living rubbish .
after the renovation , it has become a sport and cultural park and will be officially opened in november to provide free sports venues to the public , and there is no doubt that it will open up new fertile ground for all sports .
this is reminiscent of the company &apos;s school in hangzhou , a chinese swimmer &apos;s &quot; huangpu military colleges &quot; touring a number of world champions .
the name of the swimmer has been continuously produced and vividly interprets the relationship between competitive sports and sport for all - the rich masses foundation provides good conditions for the selection of professional players .
the level of competitive sports is closely related to the foundation of sports for all , and competitive sports depend on sport in a certain sense , while sports for all depends on the conditions of the site .
it is reported that , as of 2015 , china &apos;s per capita pe space is 150 times that of new china but still lags far behind the sports power .
in june this year , the state council issued the national fitness program ( 2016 - 2020 ) , which will focus on the development of mass sports .
in order to complement the short board , the relevant departments take full account of the layout of gymnasium in urban planning .
on the other hand , the completed public sports venues , including gymnasiums such as schools , should , to the extent possible , be expanded to maximize the efficiency of their use .
the rio games , now in full swing , inspired enthusiasm for the movement and awakened a sense of public participation .
jilede received attorneys &apos; fees in the dispute with merke &apos;s patent for hepatitis c
according to the judges of the united states district , gilead science has the right to a lawyer &apos;s fees arising from a patent lawsuit against hepatitis c in the murker group , a pharmaceutical company .
in june , when u.s. judges discovered that merck had committed an illegal act , including perjury and other immoral acts , gilead was exempted from paying $ 200 million in compensation for two patents from geely &apos;s sofia and havoi , which violated merck &apos;s two patents .
in a lawsuit thursday , justice beth rambo freeman , district judge of the united states , said he did not have to bear the costs of defending his defence .
merck is trying to catch up with gilead gilead &apos;s medicine , which rules a new generation of hepatitis c drugs , which can cure more than 90 % of hepatitis patients .
the case dates back to 2013 , when jilde and merck charged each other , claiming to be an active ingredient in the gillard drug , the owner of the laboratory working in sofia .

the clinton couple earned an income of $ 10.75 million in 2015 , paying 34.2 per cent of federal taxes
hillary clinton published its 2105 annual tax return on friday , showing that the democratic presidential candidate and her husband &apos;s earnings for 2015 amounted to $ 10.75 million , and 34.2 % of federal taxes .
in 2015 , clinton &apos;s charitable contribution amounted to $ 1 million , most of which was paid to the clinton foundation , where former president bill clinton paid nearly $ 5.3 million , while the former secretary of state received a $ 3 million income from the publisher , simon and shest , in a book on her tenure in the state department .
clinton &apos;s running mate , senator tim kane of virginia , and his wife , anne holton , have published 10-year tax returns .
in 2015 , they paid a federal tax of 20.3 per cent .
hillary clinton and tim kane will continue to be a sign of financial transparency , says clinton &apos;s campaign helper jennifer palmieri in a statement .
in stark contrast , donald trump covered up false claims and retracted his pledge to disclose tax returns before he did so .
although the law does not require , in accordance with established practice , presidential candidates of the united states should disclose their tax returns .
as a new york businessman , trump and his lawyers cited the irs audit as a reason for refusing to publish tax returns .
clinton &apos;s campaign aides , ian sames , said in twitter that you were the lord and attached a link to tax returns for democratic candidates .
on thursday , trump &apos;s special legal adviser , michael cohen , told cnn that he would not allow trump to disclose tax returns before the audit was completed .
critics of trump , including the 2012 republican presidential candidate , mitt romney , and other republicans , said that trump ’ s refusal to disclose tax returns would raise questions about net worth , philanthropy , business deals , and other relationships , including relations with russia .
clinton seized the issue and released a video on friday , highlighting high-profile democrats urging trump to release his taxes .
thursday she raised the issue in an economic policy speech in michigan .
she said to the crowd : &quot; for decades , he has refused to disclose his tax returns like other presidential candidates . &quot;
the new york times business columnist quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants on friday for two years in the 1990s , according to the politician news network , and the new york times business columnist quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants on friday .
federal taxes have become a major issue in the presidential campaign .
clinton named warren buffett , a billionaire investor , for at least 30 % tax dollars for people earning more than $ 1 million a year .
president obama also supports the proposal .
last week , clinton held a rally at omaha , nebraska , in berkshire hathaway , where mr. buffett called for trump to meet and exchange tax returns .
mr. buffett said he is also receiving an irs audit , which trump fears are not tax authorities but voters .
the earliest tax returns announced by the clinton campaign were 2007 .
the average federal tax rate paid by the clinton couple living in new york , in new york , between 2007 and 2014 , amounted to about 32 per cent , with a combined tax rate of about 40.5 per cent .
mr. clinton &apos;s tax return for 2015 shows that , unlike most americans , they earn only $ 100 .
their main investment is the low-cost index mutual fund , and the clinton couple &apos;s dividend and interest income is $ 109,000 .

jewish filmmakers criticize the berlin hotel for deleting the israeli phone code -- reuters news , in accordance with arab clients
a french filmmaker with jewish ancestry told the press that the berlin-based cinesky hotel did not list israeli telephone codes , and the hotel staff said it was in line with arab customers &apos; &quot; demands &quot; , prompting public opinion .
claude lizzman , author of the holocaust documentary &quot; the shoah &quot; , expressed his disappointment at the quinski hotel and published an open letter in the frankfurt report of germany .
during the recent stay , lizzman would like to find israel on the list of telephone codes provided by the hotel .
but israel is not among the countries where guests can speak directly from the room .
did israel disappear in the 2016 german capital , berlin ?
lizzman wrote .
instead , guests can call israeli calls through the call center at the quinsky hotel .
to seek an explanation , the filmmaker asked the hotel &apos;s front desk .
in his letter , mr. lizzman stated that his response in the front desk &quot; shocked him &quot; .
the hotel staff said it was &quot; a deliberate decision taken by kinsesky hotel management &quot; .
the reason for this is that the film maker is angry .
lizzmann quotes the employee &apos;s proverb : most of our guests are arabs and they call for the deletion of israel &apos;s code .
according to the south german daily newspaper , the ambassador of israel in germany , jacques hadez-hamadman , described the incident as &quot; shamelessly humiliating &quot; .
we were surprised to learn of the incident .
this is a huge shame in itself .
it took place in germany and that chain of hotels more than disgrace .
there is no need to explain this .
鈥淲e want the hotel to get the right conclusions , 鈥 ? said the official .
the incident sparked heated debate on the internet , and everyone agreed it was a scandal .
some people think that the cainsski hotel is simply meant to satisfy the demands of arab customers .
another post refers to the hotel &quot; really bad face &quot; and points out that the main street in kudum street is near a synagogue near a synagogue .
according to mirror weekly , the hotel quickly cleared up all allegations and claimed that it was &quot; negligence &quot; and expressed &quot; apologetic &quot; to mr. langman .
&quot; there has never been a direct order to remove israel from the fast-dial list , &quot; the south german daily newspaper quoted him as saying .
the newspaper also said that israeli code has been added to the list .
police using tear gas and rubber bullets to expel brazilian students
on thursday , in sao paulo , brazil , students clashed with the police in protest against the reform of the government &apos;s public education system .
the police used tear gas and rubber bullets to expel protesters .
the incident was caused by an attempt by law enforcement officials to disperse students , and the police used rubber bullets and tear gas .
several hundred students took part in the demonstration and expressed their dissatisfaction with the programmes .
in order to save money , the governor of st. paul oakming plans to close 100 public schools and 300,000 students .
some of the students who took part in the protest expressed their dissatisfaction with the temporary president , michel tel , through graffiti on the wall .
just days before a recent protest , protesters took the streets to support president dilma rousseff who had been impeached by the national senate .
the scottish self-propelled driver , calm skinner , won the gold medal after winning the gold medal
the scottish self-propelled driver , kalm skinner , last night helped britain &apos;s three teams successfully defend the olympic gold medal after the 2012 london games .
the 23-year-old glasgow himself , who replaced his scottish compatriot , sir chris hoys , became the backbone of the team , and the legendary self-propelled driver was proud to be proud of him .
four years ago , the british team were startling , and hay won five of the six gold medals in the six olympic games .
the british team finished sixth in london &apos;s world cycling championships in london , and roy has since retired .
during the beijing olympics and the london games , the british team &apos;s problem was to replace jamie staffe with the first lap of experts .
the convoy did so in the presence of hendes .
hoy &apos;s retirement left a gap , and sean imam and matt cranpton all wanted to fill the gap .
after seeing skinner &apos;s potential , the british team insisted that he should be included in the national team , and mr skinner would not .
skinner &apos;s partner was the winner of four years ago with khoei to win gold medals and kenny . three people wrote the olympic record in the qualifying period , but this was surpassed by new zealand in the first round .
the three british cyclists finally beat their opponents and won the gold medal .
despite his backwardness , kenny was ahead of the team , and skinner kept the lead until last .
the change in strategy is the key to this reversal , and candes has opted for a larger flywheel , which is slower , and this helps kenny , especially skinner , to keep pace .
hay watched the game as bbc commentator , and skinner , kenny , and simes saw him on the trophy .
&quot; it makes me feel flattered , &quot; said glasgow , a 23-year-old self-propelled driver , skinner .
i am just doing what i can and exasperate myself .
we set the olympic record in the finals and beat the world champion .
that &apos;s incredible .
nothing is better than this victory .
after winning the gold medal in the 2012 london games with kenny and hay , mr zunders admitted falling on the track in bad start .
later , he withdrew the comments , and british rivals were unable to appeal .
there is no such question as this victory .
&quot; it &apos;s like it &apos;s in london on the platform and it &apos;s the flag of england , &quot; said svanes .
we just started the team three months ago .
we &apos;ve lost a lot of world champions , so it &apos;s amazing to be defending the olympic champions .
this is just a game and a gold medal for the british team , which won a gold medal at the beijing olympics and the london games .
if this symbolizes the progress we have made over the past five months , we will continue to succeed in cycling in the coming five days .
according to kenny &apos;s state , he is not unlikely to be able to win three gold medals at an olympic games .
if that is the case , bihum is 12 years younger and is also on 23 march ( this day seems to be the holy day of the british sports world , and steve redfrett , moe farah and roger beni will have six golds and one silver medal ) .

the head of the national development and reform commission &apos;s industrial co-ordinating department said today that excess steel capacity is a global problem .
in recent years , the utilization rate of our country is higher than the global average and higher than that of the us and europe .
we have taken firm and effective measures to resolve the excess capacity and the effectiveness is gradually emerging .
the head pointed out that the global issue of excess steel capacity is a high priority for the central committee of the party .
all departments and regions actively follow up the deployment and earnest work of the state council , which will reduce the production capacity of crude steel by about 45 million tons this year .
from our national conditions , our country does not encourage the export of steel products ; instead , it has taken a series of practical measures to control the export of steel .
the director stressed that the international trade of iron and steel products is essentially market behavior , which originates from the demand of importing countries , and consumers take a comprehensive account of the product &apos;s price ratio and other factors .
the implementation of trade protection measures did not contribute to the fundamental solution to the development of the global steel industry and , on the contrary , would have a further impact on the international trade order .
when it comes to debt , the director emphasizes that resolving the debt problem is an important issue that needs to be properly addressed in the process of resolving excess capacity .
due to the size of the assets of the steel enterprises and the wide range of assets involved , the debt relationships of some enterprises are complex and , if properly disposed of , have the potential to trigger a regional risk .
according to the director , in recent years , as the economic downside pressure increases , the total demand for society gradually wanes , the capacity utilization rate of some industries has declined , and business production and business difficulties have increased .
some enterprises do not adapt to the changing market environment , production management is difficult to continue or even collapse , but suffer from some institutional mechanisms , and become &quot; zombie enterprises &quot; .
the existence of these enterprises distorts market signals , reduces the efficiency of factor resource utilization and increases the cost of social management , and hinders the establishment of fair competition market environment .
the main cause of the losses is the lack of market demand and low capacity utilization as the global steel industry is facing .
our country mainly adopts market mechanism , economic means and rule of law method , and the government is mainly to do good work and social stability and ensure fair and fair market order .
the director stressed that the next step would be to continue to work on capacity and to ensure that the five-year-old target mission of 100-150 million tons of crude steel capacity was completed .
on the afternoon of 10 p.m. , the chinese tourist police came to the attention of people in the red field in moscow , and chinese tourists waved with surprise and local people and foreign tourists stopped looking back .
on the same day , china &apos;s first professional tourism police team came to moscow red square and the local tour police to communicate with the local tour police .

when the spanish tourist came to consult , the moscow tour police conducted a patient explanation for each other in fluent spanish , leaving a deep impression on wang ice .
&quot; every member of the moscow tourist police is in a foreign language and there are more than two or more , and that &apos;s very big for us . &quot;
&quot; hainan , as an international tourist island , is gradually focusing on attracting international tourists , and we want to improve our capabilities to match the status of the international tourism islands . &quot;
the chinese tour police also exchanged visits to their russian counterparts in the city of moscow on the same day as they studied .
&quot; i often deal with chinese tourists and see that they are very happy to come to russia . &quot;

the city &apos;s environment and tourism climate has become increasingly popular in moscow in recent years , and the attraction of foreign tourists has increased , chief captain rebeckov said .
in order to adapt to the requirements of tourism development , a tourism police force was set up in july 2014 to guard , assist and channel tourists in major attractions .

the police team divided them into nine teams according to the level of foreign languages , 2 courses a week , self-defence posters , laws and regulations and foreign languages .

the chinese new network journalist combed and found that there were at least nine provinces : hebei , jilin , tianjin , jiangxi , sichuan , hainan , gansu , fujian and beijing .
in terms of the conditions for obtaining a residence permit , the above-mentioned areas are generally proposed that more than half a year shall be required to meet one of the legitimate stable employment , lawful and stable residences and continuous conditions of study .
ccn journalists noted that in terms of the treatment provided in the residence permit , there were different levels of &quot; gold content &quot; , and that the range of public services and facilities provided in some areas had expanded in comparison with national editions .
these areas have increased the availability of children to the local entrance examination in the relevant conditions .
in addition , beijing has , inter alia , explicitly requested that the scope of public services and facilities be expanded progressively and that it be made available to society on a regular basis .
for example , fujian proposes to make public services and facilities accessible to the community at least once every three years .
the provisional regulations for residence permit stipulates that the public security organ shall , within 15 days from the date of receiving it , make a residence permit within 15 days from the date of receiving the residence permit .

as the first round of the first round in 2014 , saric will go to nba next season and join philadelphia 76 .
as a young european player , sari is not well known about him , but through the olympics , it is a deep impression that saritchie &apos;s performance has been impressive .
last time in croatia &apos;s victory over spain , saric succeeded in wrapping off paul gasol &apos;s attempt to drag the race into the extra basket .
recently , 76-man coach brat-brown gave saric a high rating , which the spurs boss thought he saw at sarich as the young man &apos;s shadow of maou-gino billy .
it is clear that saaric has shown his talent , and that 76 people are full of expectations .
in the first two games of the games , saric received 24 points , 17 rebounds and 12 booths .
in the first half , surrey showed his ability to pull the space out of his presence , and he shot in the third line after his teammates were in the air .
although at present the 76-person &apos;s internal line has built up a lot of talented young players , they do not have the ivs &apos;s external capabilities .
from the cap to the start-up and completion of the attack , the nba will be able to make this point in the game today .
since the beginning of the olympic games , saric has scored 13 points in three games , eight rebounds and five booths , showing overall performance .

but for james , he doesn &apos;t have to worry about becoming a free player next summer because he has renewed a three-year contract with the knights .
james was in the contract , no matter what the date of the 2017-18 season , james was in the contract .

the future of the portland smelter is full of uncertainty due to the cancellation of the power supply contract
as the power company supplying electricity to the factory disclosed that a factory owner would terminate a supply contract to invalidate all supply contracts , and hundreds of workers in the portland aluminium smelter in victoria and hundreds of workers in the factory were currently facing an uncertain future .
the move took place after the victorian government decided not to continue to issue subsidies to ensure the operation of the plant .
the 20-year fixed subsidy will end in november .
2,000 workers in the polish plant in portland may face unemployment .
as soon as the factory is closed , up to 2,000 people may be unemployed directly or indirectly .
and since the plant &apos;s electricity consumption accounts for about 10 % of the total electricity output in victoria , a chain reaction is likely .
in 2014 , the company closed down the hamiltonian smelter , which led to the closure of the power plant in anegel last year .
aluminum company portland smelter is now losing money and faces the risk of shutdown .
the move was made after a forecast of the plant &apos;s future years , initially because the australian dollar was stronger , and most recently because of the prices of factory products .
agl provides electrical power to the large aluminium smelter through the old eyang power plant in the rhubble valley in lilot , which is expected to terminate its agreement by three other plant owners .
the largest shareholder in the factory is a joint venture of aluminum and alumina companies , while china &apos;s citic group and japan &apos;s mt .
&quot; agl is expected to continue operations in the portland plant , which means that the smelter will continue to generate electricity demand , &quot; the joint venture said .
agl states that these contracts were &quot; hedging contracts &quot; that should have been in force since november 2016 .
the end of the contract is 12 months and therefore they will be terminated in 2017 .
the electricity company said : &quot; therefore , agl still anticipates that these contracts will continue to generate revenue in the fiscal year 2017 . &quot;
any income implications for agl since the fiscal year 2018 are now subject to a futures market &apos;s optimistic outlook on wholesale electricity prices .
agl indicated that the company had reduced its contract value of $ 187 million in the &quot; end-of-activity expectation &quot; .
aluminum said the decision to terminate these contracts &quot; would not affect the company &apos;s ability to operate the smelter or to ensure the smelter &apos;s power supply . &quot;
the american company said it had signed a 20-year contract in 2010 , which would have entered into force in november , but the company did not explain why it withdrew from the contract .
analysts were cautious about whether the portland smelter in victoria and the tombgo factory in the vicinity of newcastle would be closed because of the terrible economic situation in the industry .
in response to analysts &apos; comments earlier this week , stephen mackson , director of agl operations , said portland had reached about 600 mw per year and the tomogo plant reached some 900 mw .
if the two factories are closed , the demand for the electricity market will be greatly reduced .
&quot; it &apos;s not a good news for us to be a power company , &quot; he said .
the community law centre keeps 160,000 people out of doors every year
more than 160,000 of the most vulnerable groups are rejected by community law centres each year , and funding for this service has been overstretched and is now facing further funding cuts .
in queensland , three out of every five persons were denied access to free legal advice and representation , most of them older persons , migrants , vulnerable workers , victims of violence and those who did not have the resources to fight against unfair expulsions .
the lack of funds for community legal services has long outstripped the limit and is now facing further funding cuts .
since june of next year , federal government funding for these centres will be reduced by 30 per cent .
according to the director of the queensland community legal centre , james farrell , according to the latest national community law centre &apos;s investigation report , thousands of people are turned away each year .
mr. farrell said the situation would only be worse if the federal government did not change the existing decision .
&quot; queensland &apos;s community law center is permanently underfunded , which means thousands of people will not be able to get the important services they need , &quot; he said .
people who need to stay away from violence , those who are unable to pay large debts , are faced with a shattered family , pressed workers , who face a legal dimension , and the report shows that they are unable to obtain the help they need .
the federal government will reduce its funding by 30 per cent since june 2017 , which means that thousands of vulnerable groups in queensland will be forced to face complex legal issues without help .
we call on the minister of justice and president of queensland , george brandeth , to rescind these reductions immediately so that people may receive the assistance they need in the face of legal problems .
last year , the state government pledged to raise legal aid funds to the national average .
attention must now be paid to the needs of community law centres and their corresponding communities , and the government must also invest in this important work .

britain has to deliver the olympic spirit and expand at heathrow airport
heathrow will also bring dynamism and prosperity to our communities , london and the country as a whole .
for me , this is the charm of heathrow , just as we did our best to ensure that our countries and regions benefited from these events at the 2012 london olympics .
the olympic games benefited greatly from stratford and eastern district .
and we will create opportunities for local people and businesses around heathrow once again to benefit the region .
for our local communities alone , we will create 10,000 new entrants , 40,000 new jobs and freeing young people around the airport from unemployment .
as the london olympics in 2012 , some people think that the expansion of heathrow is too large .
i have been told that britain will not be ready for the olympics , and we will be humiliated around the world .
skeptics are wrong about the 2012 olympics , and their doubts about the heathrow project will prove to be wrong .
although there are always obstacles that need to be overcome , heathrow is solving every problem he faces .
like the olympics , heathrow is the infrastructure project for most people , not just a few .
the expansion will create as many as 180,000 new jobs , bringing about 21 billion pounds of economic growth , leaving behind the airport and britain as a source of technology and employment .
we have an excellent heathrow project team , which has delivered pound11 billion in infrastructure investment projects on time and within the budget , including the t5 terminal and the t2 terminal in the world &apos;s busiest two runways for five consecutive years .
now they are preparing to build a third track with a private investment of 16 billion pounds .
britain has successfully hosted the 2012 london olympics , and i believe that the heathrow airport expansion project will also be a great success .
it is a good time for us to convey the olympic spirit and expand heathrow &apos;s airport , so that we can sail for our future and create a wealth of technology and employment that makes the united kingdom proud .
lord paul dock is chairman of heathrow airport board of directors and former british ministry of finance commercial counsellor

nasa climate model : venus was suitable for human habitation
according to the prediction of nasa &apos;s new climate model , venus was suitable for human habitation .
scientists at nasa &apos;s goddod space research institute have developed a model that explores the past of venus , using tools and algorithms that are very similar to those used by climate scientists .
the model is used to determine whether venus with high temperature , anhydrate and atmospheric carbon dioxide has ever had an environment similar to that of the earth .
previously , scientists thought venus was slower because its atmosphere was thicker .
but the latest analog shows that venus may have had a thinner , like earth &apos;s atmosphere , and the speed of rotation was as slow as it was .
the model also shows the early stage of venus .
the dry area of venus may be greater than the rest of the earth , but there was enough water and geography to breed life and prevent rapid evaporation .
earlier , the sunlight on venus was 30 % lighter than that of the earth .
&quot; in the model of the golddead institute for space research , venus slowly rotates for nearly two months , &quot; said antonio de ginho , a scientist at the university of goedad space in a news conference .
this makes the surface warm and produces a thick layer of rain , thick clouds , like an umbrella , blocking most of the sun &apos;s heat .
the result of the simulation is that the average climatic temperature of venus is actually lower than that of the earth now .
the venus evolution simulated by the model is similar to that of previous planetary scientists .
while life may have existed on venus , venus has been exposed to excessive temperatures and ultraviolet light in several billion years .
the ocean evaporates on the planet , and water vapor is consumed by ultraviolet light .
with hydrogen &apos;s escape , only a thicker carbon dioxide atmosphere and deadly greenhouse gases are left behind , forming the venus we know today .
the researchers published the results of the new venus climate model in the journal of geophysical research newsletter .
patrick roy resigned as the manager of the avalanche
patrick roy , who resigned as coach and vice president of the colorado avalanche in thursday , said he had no voice at the decision-making level .
joe savings , managing director of the vice-president of colorado , confirmed the news and said the club would start looking for a new manager at once .
&quot; in the past three years , i have lived with energy , passion and determination to perform the duties of the coach and vice-president of the colorado avalanche , &quot; mr roy , 50 years old , said in a statement .
i meditated throughout the summer to reflect on how to improve the team so that it would have a higher level of strength .
to this end , the goal of the manager and vice president must be consistent with the goals of the club .
he also needs to have a voice in decisions that affect the performance of the team .
currently , however , these conditions have not yet been met .
zachus hired roy on 23 may 2013 to express his appreciation for roy &apos;s contribution to the team .
&quot; patrick was telling me his decision today , &quot; he said .
we thank him for his contribution to the club and hope he will sail well in the future .
roy was named the best coach of jack adams in his first season in 2013-14 .
he helped the club with 112 points , first in the central division . but the first round of colorado was eliminated in minnesota in the first round of the season , and in the last two years he lost his arm in the playoffs .
during the 2015 - 16 season , the avalanche &apos;s performance was 39 - 4 minus 39 , and in the end , 5 out of five points lost the second external card qualification in the western atlantic region .
as a goalkeeper of the hall , roy has won four stanley cups , each with two seats for the montreal canadian team and the avalanche .
workers in the north sea oilfield suspended the strike and resumed negotiations
the chief negotiator said workers in north china stopped a strike on pay , and the parties began a new round of talks .
on the north sea oil platform operated by the royal dutch shell , there have been several strikes on the oilfield service company wood group .
according to a joint statement , wood group and unite and rmt unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute .
we will begin to revisit these issues in the coming weeks , starting early next week .
the union said its recent move was to protest the possibility of a 30 % drop in pay , the first time the union has taken for 25 years .
wood group has reduced compensation for the north sea contractor by about 9 % this year due to market pressures .
before the cut-off , the company reduced its compensation by sea contractors by 10 % in 2014 .
the company said it would help the company through a slump in the market .
the shell has cut thousands of workers and announced plans to shut down oil and gas equipment in 10 countries because companies need to streamline their operations following the merger with bp &apos;s uk-based gas group .
energy companies are under pressure from falling crude oil prices and the brexit decision of june .
scottish parliament member dave anderson met with union leaders earlier this week to explore the biggest labour dispute of the north sea .
he said the north sea is of vital importance to the region &apos;s economy .
&quot; in the north sea and the whole country , we need an economy that serves most people rather than minorities , &quot; dave said in a statement .
in 2016 , the expenditure on new projects in the north sea is projected to be less than $ 1.4 billion , while the average project expenditure over the past five years has amounted to about $ 7 billion .

the latest mission of the kepler space telescope has helped astronomers capture the most complete star star rotation speed .
new data are helping astronomers understand why the stellar star has a different rotation speed and the association of the rotation cycle with the stars .
&quot; we want to compare our results with other clusters to further understand the relationship between stars &apos; quality , age , and even the history of their solar system , &quot; said rusa reble , a research scientist at the california institute of technology &apos;s infrared processing analysis center at a news conference .
the stars are far away from the earth for 445 light years .
many of the stars in the cluster were born about 125 million years ago and have just reached adulthood .
they have reached the highest rate of rotation in a lifetime .
at the highest rate of rotation , these mature stars ejected a large number of stars .
when these stellar winds pass through the magnetic field of the star , they have a brake effect on the stars .
as the age of the stars increases , its rotation speed begins to slow down .
doppler measured the rotation speed of the stars by tracking the time that can be detected by tracing the recognizable stars ( like sunspots ) .
the latest spin speed datasets indicate that the rotating speed of a larger star is slower than the smaller stars .
reubble likened star to dancers , with bigger dancers spinning faster than smaller dancers .
&quot; the fastest-moving star is often the lightest star , &quot; mr reber said .
due to the proximity of the stonite regiment , it can be used as the ideal universe laboratory for comparing star mass and rotation speed .
&quot; the team is laying the groundwork for a two-way rotating theory model for young and aged stars , &quot; mr reber said .
we still have a lot of knowledge about how stellar , when and how to slow the speed of rotation and &quot; take up your shoes &quot; .
these three papers will soon be published in the journal of astronomy .
zheng jianlian , head of the south lake park waters management section , said the water in the southernmost water of lake nanhu was more than 10 metres deep , and it was possible that the water would be in danger .

&quot; the success of the games is defined by people who share stories with the social media , &quot; the rio group said in its 2012 olympic communications strategy .
from the report of the present olympic games , the media in the form of communication , product form , language style , news perspective and so on has done a lot of changes .
the international olympic committee and media practitioners around the world seem to have met the challenge .
on august 11 , the shanghai-based hu shares went on sale for the last day , and news notes that the two-day market reaction was flat , and that it would be listed on aug. 18 at the hong kong stock exchange on august 18 .
according to a domestic brokerage analyst , oriental securities in hong kong is not good , its management business is the director of the east card , which compares to bank of china international , citic securities and other bank securities firm , appear incompetent .
experts point out that since the return of the securities market to the light of the securities market this year , many brokerages have experienced a decline in their performance , but that the company will be more likely to see the development of the company &apos;s own business in the wake of the listing .
when the new deal is in place , suzhou will become the first two-tier city in the country to reboot .
the second-line city of market regulation policy is introduced or is about to be put in place . it also includes hefei , nanjing and other cities .
previously , hefei has taken the lead in issuing the cap-and-loan policy , and banks will refuse to offer mortgage services in two houses in hefei and a home-owned housing lender .
