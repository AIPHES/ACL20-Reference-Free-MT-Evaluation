the british medical association junior doctors committee will require all its members from early september began to support more industrial action .
junior doctors committee , said ministers unresolved for a contract to worry about .
junior doctors and medical students in the 7 month voted to boycott the british medical association reached a contract deal .

junior doctors committee chair ellen mccourt on thursday night in the twitter published a letter to the members of the letter said that for the resulting contract was to resist , the government “ has consistently maintained silence . ”
she said : “ in view of this , the junior doctors committee the executive committee has voted overall rejected the proposed new contract and call for all concerns re the formal consultation . ”
for the government of the silence , the junior doctors committee of the executive committee have today officially asked the british medical association council held a special meeting approved the is intended to from the beginning of september to start the upgrade of the labour action of a long-term plan .

russia and turkey : “ the alien alliance ” is ?
a gesture end a crisis .
russian and turkish leaders on tuesday to meet with both sides shaking hands and announced the official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions .
however , when vladimir putin in a st. petersburg palace of the golden hall to meet the president of turkey , i have a strong feeling : this settlement is in ankara most want to see .
yes , both sides do the handshake .
however , even according to mr. putin has always reserved the standard view , putin is also just shallow smile , almost did not exude enthusiasm .
it was reported that recep tayyip erdogan is five times referred to “ good friend ” vladimir putin .
i can &apos;t remember .
at the same time , his commitment to relations with russia will return to the crisis levels , and even reach the higher levels .
the next day , this newspaper wrote that mr. erdoğan then act as if nothing happened .
however , i think his enthusiasm hint at some of the opposite things .
however , mr. putin continued cold attitude stating that he had nothing to forget .
in fact , in his opening remarks mentioned the first thing is the crisis of reason : turkey in the syrian border shot down a russian fighter .
moscow at the time of the reaction is very intense .
mr. putin , for the event to be lashed out , accusing ankara in the behind the plot against moscow .
from the so-called friends attack more difficult for people to accept .
both very difficult , or even impossible to re-establish real trust .
since 11 beginning of may , the russian public opinion has also been reversed .
in recent months , is government-controlled media against ankara for the shocking full attack .
all of a sudden , the turks seem to be for all things responsible .
among them , the most serious is from the senior officials of the accusations : mr. erdogan &apos;s family members from the so-called islamic state-controlled syrian region of illegal oil trading in profit .
he has categorically denied this kind of statement .
however , the st. petersburg came the news shows , is the time to look forward .
after all the meeting is the premise of vladimir putin received turkish president recep tayyip erdogan &apos;s apology .
russia can declare victory .
for ankara , the truce , the benefits are obvious .
first of all , recep tayyip erdogan last month , the coup failed after nearly being ousted , so he needs all the support of friends .
constant terrorist attacks have clearly caused him great blow .
at the same time there are also economic motives .
russian sanctions on turkey to combat is very big , especially the prohibition of a year can be transported several hundred thousand russian tourists to the turkish coast charter service .
the number has fallen sharply to nearly 90 per cent .
as the flight resumed , the russian travel agencies and charter companies will breathe easy .
they will usher in the end of the season the mediterranean tourism flows .
state television even predicted this week , once the turkish agricultural imports re-release , fruit and vegetable prices will fall .
the moscow newspaper vedemosti article reported that : “ tourists went , the tomato back . ”
for moscow , the visit also has an additional political value .
ankara for the western world to butt tube is the intention of the weak reaction to feel angry .
in addition , ankara for the eu accession negotiations the slow progress and putin &apos;s meddling in a long-term dissatisfaction with vladimir putin is keen to use the political chill and undermine turkey with the western world of the relationship .
since the coup after the failure to embrace the elected authorities , the russian leader will get ankara plus .
note that this is for the always on regime change arms deep-rooted fear of moscow is a gift .
therefore , in this magnificent seaside palace was held the meeting that russia and turkey , two by western world refused and the abuse of countries to form allies , one analyst described it as “ alien league ” .
however , despite the public reconciliation , but the parties there are still significant differences .
syria is one of the key factors in . moscow recently in syria play a peacemaker role , while russia and turkey support the opposite faction .
can foresee is , after nearly three hours of preliminary conversation , the two presidents at the briefing said , has not yet addressed that topic .
turkish president deliberately evasive about the differences between the parties of the problem , and putin is to be stressed .
both sides in syria on the issue of unity in diversity did not reach a clear consensus .
in the north atlantic treaty organization member turkey to shoot down the russian fighter the months of open hostility and lead to large-scale disaster of may , the two leaders again to restart the dialogue certainly is a good thing .
the royal bank of scotland will no longer be for scotland other than the customer service
according to the royal bank of scotland chief executive revealed that the bank will be simplified to a logistics department .
the royal bank of scotland will no longer be for scotland other than the customer service .
ross mcewan told the bbc scotland division of the royal bank of scotland brand has ever committed to its global ambitions .
but eight years ago , on the verge of collapse , had to accept a bailout from then began to give up that pursuit .
that time , the brand strategist using ‘ rbs ’ to protect other consumer finance brand .
the group had spent millions of pounds to sponsor the rugby six nations tournament and wimbledon tennis champion andy murray and other ways to sponsor international sporting events .
now , however , the correct approach is to let more of the national brands emerge .
the royal bank of scotland will provide scottish customers with , but not reply as it is .
in england and wales , all in the headquarters and the stock exchange other than the reference will change to national westminster bank .
ulster bank brand has been used in the republic of ireland and northern ireland and of the autonomous community of customers .
there are some other more prominent small private bank brand , such as coutts , adam &amp; co , drummond and holt &apos;s military bank .
mcewan worked in inverness county customers and employees to visit the tour in an interview .
he told bbc scotland branch , said : “ the royal bank of scotland brand will eventually become our investors brand , is also an employee employed by one of the brands , because the current greater sense we have become one with the many brands of the bank . ”
since the bank itself to become an international brand , rbs has also become a global brand .
currently , i have to say is , we no longer focus on the world , we have turned to native .
each brand represents their respective industry is different , and our staff through the different brands for customer service .
the royal bank of scotland has shown that will not continue to sponsor the six nations championship ; at the same time , efforts have been made to enhance the different brands in the sports events sponsorship of the image .
chief executive officer , said : “ now come to become a multi-brand banks , as privately we have been exploring how to become a better service to the customers of the bank . ”
if three years ago we aspire to become a company with numerous brands of the big banks will be much mocking .
currently we focus on the needs of customers , and i believe you have noticed these changes .
i think we can restart these brands , and now the time is appropriate .

russian president vladimir putin lifted sergei ivanov chief of staff positions
russian president vladimir putin ( vladimir putin ) unexpectedly lifted sergei ivanov ( sergei ivanov ) , the office of the president director positions .
over the years , mr. ivanov has been won , mr. putin , trust the core group of a molecule .
now 63-year-old ivanov has now been appointed as environment and traffic problems of the special representative .
the kremlin statement said mr. putin had “ announced the lifting ivanov of the russian president &apos;s office director , ” but did not give a reason .
the beginning of 2012 as mr. ivanov his deputy anton watts eno ( anton vaino ) has been appointed as his successor .
waj mr. jean , 44 years old , is a former diplomat .
he was born in 1972 in tallinn , estonia , graduated from the famous moscow state institute of international relations ( mgimo ) , in the tokyo embassy .
later , he managed the presidential draft and the government employees , the kremlin website using the russian says .
appointment after he for mr. putin , said : “ thank you for your trust . ”
i think the present government &apos;s most important task is to support the head of state drafting of laws and controls the instruction implementation .
mr. putin on friday told russian television that mr. ivanov himself demanded the resignation and recommend the waj mr. jean to pick any of their own .
such a smile convincing ?
moscow on the move puzzled .
for a long time , sergei ivanov has been putin &apos;s closest aides , one of with putin , as also in the soviet security agency （ kgb ） .
as chief of staff , he was the country &apos;s most influential people .
in a state television broadcast of the meeting with president putin meeting , the two per capita said the chief of staff himself resigned .
although in front of the camera , all smiles , but almost nobody is convinced-especially before the parliamentary elections this time .
so , this is in some kind of power struggle in the lost cause ?
yet from that .
however , the official story-the one who had been regarded as the presidential candidate of the people suddenly choose to the helm of russia &apos;s environmental policy-lead to many doubts .
on the kremlin website quoted mr. ivanov and mr. putin &apos;s dialogue , he said : &quot; yes , at the beginning of 2012 , i was in a conversation request you to be me this is difficult to do the job , and even can be said to be a troublesome job , four-year term . &quot;
&quot; the result is , i have served as the president of the office of the director of the four year and eight months . &quot;
mr. ivanov in the 2011 12 months as of this post .
prior to that , he served as deputy prime minister and defense minister .
he is the russian security committee , also told mr. putin , just as the nsa before the members .
the 20th century the late 90s , when mr. putin appointed federal security fsb , formerly known as the national security agency director , mr. ivanov was appointed as his deputy .
mr. putin came to power , he also specifies mr. ivanov for his most trusted five people .
the outside world was once believed that mr. ivanov will probably be in mr. putin second tenure as russian president , because the third re-election is unconstitutional .
but this position ultimately attributed to putin &apos;s another close aide dmitry medvedev ( dmitry medvedev ) 。
in the three and a half years after the re-appointment of the president before , mr. putin served as russian prime minister .

although the bridge &apos;s size and weight are huge , but the completion of the viaduct and the bridge between the closure they need to fine a job that requires a very precise assembly .
overall , nearly 79 % of the total bridge deck is now installed to complete the last section of the bridge deck the concrete deck today in rosyth casting , that is to say all the deck has been doing well on the bits ready .

completed the job required to the north of overhead bridge moved south to 700 mm .
this is a huge job , but also is a very precision job .
saying it large scale , is because the viaduct length 222 meters , and weighs about 6,000 metric tons , the need to pull out about a 3 % slope .
say it precision is because the engineering team needed to ensure that the deviation is very small , on each side only a few millimeters .
it is reassuring that everything is going very smoothly .

why do we need simon , gabe beautiful ella and laurie
that &apos;s how i evaluate this year &apos;s women &apos;s olympic gymnastics team , the reason more than one .
first , from 1984 onwards , i went to each session of the summer olympics , but the united states has never been so occupied supremacy .
secondly , the gymnastics team has three outstanding gymnasts--simon byers ( simone biles ) , plus cloth lai ella douglas ( gabby douglas ) and laurie hernandez ( lauren laurie hernandez ) , who has inspired many colored girl .
this team composition so that all people are proud of , because the inside contains a judaism of ali leslie mann ( aly raisman ) and the catholic madison corsi ann ( madison kocian ) 。
this team finally looks like the us team .
it also consolidates black and hispanic women in this sport in the peak position .
over the past four years , the premier female gymnasts have been non-americans .
last year , simon and gabe beautiful ella a breakdown of the first , second .
it &apos;s too powerful .
on the olympic games , gabe the beautiful ella douglas “ unexpected ” to become olympic champion , it made us cheer all the time .
today , the whole world can witness the three-time world champion simon byers , douglas and laurie hernandez fantastic performance . they put conventional gymnastic skills interpretation draw god into .
on thursday , simon helped the us team in the women &apos;s individual all-around on the project to achieve four consecutive years .
her teammates ali leslie mann won the silver medal .
we boarded the sport &apos;s pinnacle , but in the united states gymnastics teaching in the classroom is not so .
simon , gabe beautiful ella and laurie into the olympic team the way with ali and madison .
they are the “ ultimate five people group ” ( the final five ) , because the next olympic gymnastics team will be composed of four gymnasts in the composition , this is marta karolyi last year of coaching .
but the reality is that gymnastics is a costly sport , gymnast mainly in the private gymnastics club for training , their parents need to pay for training , facilities , travel , clothing , competitions , and hotel costs , including the coach and the gymnast and family-related costs , and the cost of inventory is still increasing .
most of the gymnastics club is located in can be for the industry to provide support of the wealthy suburbs .
gymnast all the training in these clubs is completed , the gymnast of the family in terms of a long-term expensive expenses .
byers coach amy berman ( aimee boorman ) and hernandez &apos;s coach maggie haney from the two gymnasts started practicing gymnastics has been coaching them .
we must be more affordable , more available and of gymnastics training brings numerous well received by simon , gabe beautiful ella and laurie affect the young girl .
20 years ago , i founded his own gymnastics foundation .
in my organization , we in the black residential areas to 15,000 city youth , mainly black and hispanic americans provide free , inexpensive gym and train out of the country and even the world champion .
9 months , we will expand to detroit is my hometown , and to those who are worthy of receive this opportunity to learn from this great olympic movement to benefit the young people to provide high quality gymnastics .
gymnastics helps develop body strength , flexibility and coordination , also helps develop hard-working spirit , self-discipline and determination .
these can be for a person &apos;s health , academic and work success to bring lifelong benefits .
by this team of inspiring thousands of young girls will learn gymnastics , this is really great .
participation in sports is significant , for girls in particular .
this is an exciting time .

the company is located in qingdao old town , the factory area of the end of last year comprehensive discontinued , environmental relocation to the flatness of the new plant area .
zhao xiu ping had submitted the application form , the construction project environmental impact reports and other materials , qingdao emission rights stocks and trading service center of the application materials for the first instance .
according to the qingdao municipal price and finance departments to determine the imposed standards , currently estimated calculation of initial emission rights use fee of about 64 . 12 million yuan , the staff will be within 7 working days to complete approval .
the upcoming completion of the transaction the first single also heralded qingdao emission rights trading pilot work officially kicked off , will also be the province &apos;s emission rights trading first national and city-level emission trading the first single .

the same day , qingdao sifang new chengzhi zhuo passenger car accessories co . , ltd. to an annual output of 4200 pieces of high-speed rail and emu interior accessories item purchase pollution rights .
the project belongs to the mechanical processing enterprises , the application of the initial emissions of chemical oxygen demand ( cod ) 0.514 tons / year , ammonia nitrogen ( nox ) 0.052 tons / year .
air pollutant emission rights paid use and trading for the city &apos;s electricity , heat production and supply of key industrial enterprises .
2016 1 month prior to 1 has been made in the eia of the existing sewage units , no levy paid royalties .
“ paid to obtain emission rights are not equal to get the illegal sewage authority , and can not be freely discharged pollutants . ”
qingdao city environmental protection bureau deputy director han red yan introduced , if the illegal sewage , excessive sewage continues to be in accordance with the relevant regulations will be punished , can not allow illegal businesses through the purchase of emission rights way to circumvent the penalties .
that is , through legal means to crack down on environmental violations , punish the enterprises exceed the standard discharge behavior , thereby protecting the environment , safeguarding public health .
now the enterprise in order to their own interests , improve the pollution of enthusiasm , cherish the limited emission rights , reducing pollutant emissions .
with the economic interests of the drive , reduce the emission of pollutants from government coercion into the corporate consciousness of the market behavior , so as to really achieve the protection of the environment , protection of nature , protection of public health .
emission rights , also known as “ emissions ” , are emissions of pollutants of rights , refers to emissions in the government allocation of credit , legally entitled to the environment discharge of pollutants to the right .
this right is essentially a polluter of the environment capacity resources , the possession , use and income rights .
next , in the discharge of pollutants total amount does not exceed the allowable emissions under the premise , the interior of each pollution source through the currency exchange to each other transfers the sewage amount .
emission trading since 1968 by the american economist dales proposed since the 20 century 70 &apos;s the united states applied to the atmospheric and river pollution source management .
our country from the beginning of 2007 for the pilot , there are already zhejiang , jiangsu and other 14 provinces ( area , city ) in full implementation .

china &apos;s mars program to a
my mars mission you want to achieve surround , landing , patrol , this form in a foreign country never had .
china &apos;s mars probe launch goal is to want to step around , landing , patrol , this task with considerable difficulty .
because mars probe to 26 months in order to meet a time window , so experts are working closely to develop engineering plans to fight in 2020 , the window for launching china &apos;s first mars probe .
according to xu da zhe introduction , although china &apos;s aircraft has entered deep space , but the completion of the mars mission is still indispensable , the detection of mars means that the chinese from the true sense of entering deep space exploration era .
“ every two or three years , only once mars from earth the nearest opportunity , at this point in time on the launch mars probe on the launch vehicle is the most fuel energy . ”
“ taking into account the mars of quality , by china &apos;s long march five carrier rocket to complete the launch mission . ”
my mars mission you want to achieve surround , landing , patrol , this form in a foreign country is never , abroad had been intended to achieve a surround and landing , but the landing failed .
mars relates to the technical field very much , particularly in that , although rover is a space probe , but with the general space probes compared , it also has distinctive features .
that is , the mars probe to have the determined travel route , find obstacles dangerous ability .
china aerospace science and technology corporation five homes researcher pang of ho said , human reason why the mars probe so favored , is because the detection of mars has important scientific , technical and other aspects of significance , and even related to the future of humanity .
currently mars has become in addition to the planet other than the human studies degree the highest of the planets , the human use of space probes to mars exploration history almost throughout the entire human spaceflight history .
therefore , human hope that , one day in mars is to establish a living base , and ultimately to mars immigrants , turn it into humanity &apos;s second home .
a large number of signs also suggest that mars used to be possible with the current earth is the same , but after billions of years of evolution before they turn into the atmosphere is thin , the temperature is low , water depletion , etc. look .
therefore , a probe or a manned landing on mars to conduct research , you can to prevent the earth becomes human to survive a second martian the proposed plan .
as of 2016 6 months , the global total of 114 times the moon probe , the 43 missions to mars .
however , from the 20th century 90 &apos;s to the present , the human carried out a total of 18 times in mars exploration , and lunar exploration is only carried out 14 times .
there are currently 5 of a mars orbiter and a 2 car mars rover at work , but only 1 lunar orbiter 1 lunar lander at work .
the world space powers have developed to the mars system for the target detection scheme , thus , today &apos;s mars than the moon probe also hot .
2013 11 november 5 , india launched its first mars probe “ mann , gary ” , becoming asia &apos;s first successful probe to mars in the country .
“ mann , gary ” used to study martian surface , atmosphere and mineral characteristics , to explore on mars whether or not methane and signs of life .
this mission is the most difficult place , is to probe into the martian atmosphere after the aerodynamic shape and the parachute deceleration only get one chance
according to the china aerospace science and technology corporation five homes overall portion of the mars rover chief designer sun ze zhou introduced , the mars mission faces many technical challenges .
mars atmospheric pressure is very low , only the surface of the earth atmospheric pressure of 1 % , with a high uncertainty .
about it change and storm characteristics and other factors , scientists have not thorough understanding .
mars in the summer often form similar to earth dust weather , the dust storms , which will lead to the mars rover receiving the sunlight energy declined sharply , and must be for the rover to design a “ sleep ” mode , so its patiently waiting for the dust storms of the past .
at the same time , the martian atmosphere for sunlight there are cuts in effect , this is mars of the energy supply difficult .
this requires the detector 太阳翼 a larger area , and the need to constantly adjust , effort is aligned with the sun direction .
also , mars surface gravity only the earth &apos;s 38 % , but the ratio of the moon &apos;s surface gravity mostly , so the detector needs more power .
“ this mars mission the most core , the most difficult place , is to probe into the martian atmosphere after the aerodynamic shape and the parachute deceleration process , and only one chance , must ensure success . ”
sun ze zhou said , since the earth and mars distances , the entire process can not be made the ground real-time control , so must rely on the detector independent complete .
because not as much propellant to offset so high speed , so landing on mars , the deceleration to rely on the martian atmosphere &apos;s role , however , the martian atmosphere is difficult to on the ground simulation .
pang of ho said that overall , the detection of the martian way and exploration of the moon in a similar manner , is also “ around , fall , tour , back ” , eventually achieving a manned landing on mars of the target .
due to mars distance from earth than the moon from earth , much farther away , so the detection of mars need to overcome a range of more complex technical difficulties .
according to taiwan media reports , taiwan “ premier ” forest-wide yesterday morning announced that , “ political parties and their accompanying organizations improper acquisition of property regulation ” from today onwards to take effect .
the kmt vice chairman zhan kai yin then said , “ a hundred years of history of the kuomintang , has the social commitment with responsibilities , not so that you fail ” it .

he said , by gu li xiong as improper party production committee chairman is not the second person to borrow hung bacon in the past checked observed related to major cases of experience , will serve as committee inventory related to the improper party production case basis .
chan kai-yin think , today , as long as there is a party production , no one will give you the social contributions , if the party produced all be confiscated taken away , the nationalists just can request social support and sponsorship , “ today really is not only a chance to go ” .
chan kai-yin also stressed that even if the improper party to the production of regulations to hit the road after the kuomintang party production has not been completely confiscated , confiscated , and the rest will still be under a commitment to donate out , let the party producing the quasi-zero , the party to be all from scratch .

although it is not confirmed , but many sources have stated that apple 2016 fall conference will be in 9 months held iphone7 really want to .
although apple did not respond , but about the new iphone &apos;s features , the configuration has been to have the message released , even online even iphone7 “ real machine model ” pictures have been .
the new generation of iphone can be described as “ highly anticipated ” , the hot , tight , and money no ...... if you want the first time to purchase an authentic , be sure to choose a good channel , such as suning .
this has exacerbated the people for the new phone disappointed , “ it lengthened , but simply cannot project holographic images ! this generation of the iphone sucks . ”
iphone7 like other iphone like , before the birth accompanied with numerous secret smell .
in addition , there are multiple news sources claim that the next generation iphone will cancel the 3 . 5mm headphone jack , instead using a bluetooth connection and charging port , this will be for apple to add a second speaker to provide space .
to support the message another evidence is that early in 2014 , apple will allow the headphones to manufacturers through the charging interface connected to the headset products .
these messages or true or false , the answer until apple 2016 autumn conference to be announced .
but this does not prevent insiders optimistic about the iphone7 prospects-many people believe that the iphone7 will likely become apple for the iphone series of the last significant upgrade .
although never long before the market research firm idc released data , the iphone market share declined .
wherein , goldman sachs will apple &apos;s stock maintain a “ buy ” rating , while bmo analyst is considered iphone7 will receive a copy of the historic sales performance .
while broadcom &apos;s ceo hock tan also said that apple future increase in revenue will likely exceed 20 % , and this is entirely thanks to the iphone7 launch .
7 % of respondents said they have purchased iphone7 plan , and two years ago plans to buy the iphone6 in the proportion of only 4 per cent .
it is understood that currently holds the iphone6 or 6plus user groups a 20 % plan to purchase iphone7 , which is quite a high percentage .
secondly , there is expert analysis , the majority of fruit powder like generational replacement of your own iphone .
according to statistics , in all of iphone user , there are about 26 % of users has been 2 years without replacing phone , i.e. almost 1 . 2 billion users of the iphone have been using it for 2 years .
have the media called , the iphone7 production period , taiwan suffered a number of earthquakes , the “ tsmc production facilities affected by the extent of the damage beyond imagination , and it is possible for the initial iphone7 supply impact . ”
contradiction between supply and demand will affect the ordinary user , it is time to choose a good channel , the first time low into the authentic iphone7 。
according to informed sources , recently , suning high-rise with apple frequently meet , purpose is in order to prepare for adequate supply .

her in the table tennis rankings for 8 consecutive years to maintain first in the world , is the table tennis history ranking of “ the world ” for the longest time female athlete .
2010 年 9 月 26th , the fancy people &apos;s daily under-secretary-general and the people search network ag general manager , the main hall level cadres .
recently , she and yu have teamed up together to build the first domestic sports industry innovation and entrepreneurship platform .
china sports arena also has such a group of stars coach : they are in the athletes the era of fame for the country to win countless glory ; retired after many years the school taught to the newcomers , nurtured in the winning army .
as the chinese men &apos;s gymnastics first world champion , topaz bin retired after the option to pick up pointer to .
from the women &apos;s team coach to the men &apos;s team coach , to head coach , huang bin has created an “ olympic golden mission ” , more rate team in the beijing olympic games achieved 9 gold 1 silver 4 copper for the mythical record .
thereafter , tian liang has been advertising endorsements constantly , even more in recent years played a “ cowboy ” , the “ lei feng ” and other important roles .
many nba players have proved their strength . however , some progress was fading .
whether it is because of increasing age or playing time is limited , each season there are some players that performance will appear to step backwards .
of course , some “ regressed ” may only be data of the shrink , these players the strength may not decline .
even if wade is still the league best shooting guard , but he in the bull &apos;s performance should not have heat so well .
he and rondo composed of the field after the range is limited , headed star butler point shooting only 32 . 8 % , which makes them the next season and the offense will hit very crowded .
came to the windy city , the flash is bound to put the ball right more to butler and rondo , their own are likely in the regular season to select the regimen play .
okafor , the situation is more awkward , as on the season 76 person of the first choice , he in the new season have and simmons and grace than de competition for playing time and the ball right .
this competition may not come soon , simmons is also the need to adapt to the nba arena , grace than de is also to be as soon as possible from injuries fully recover , but okafor can at the 76 human long human array with a position is still a problem .
last season , okafor 32 % of the score from the low post , this proportion is higher than cousins , and wu cut vicky and brook lopez , while his usage rate is also the highest in the union before the of 40 .
as simmons has demonstrated excellent control of the ball striker potential , grace than de also has a more suitable nba the game of stature , okafor &apos;s status would be difficult to then then secure .
over the past two seasons , thompson &apos;s usage rate has been stable in the league before 20 , which is also his career best of two seasons .
but the problem is , with durant &apos;s arrival , thompson &apos;s usage rate will decline , this is bound to affect his play .
this impact will not only be shots of the impact , the soup is god &apos;s attacking the ball the next season certainly will be greatly reduced , which in some ways will also reduce the opponent for his defense difficulty .
durant &apos;s arrival will let the warriors players are data shrinking , but shrinking the most serious is perhaps thompson .
but this does not mean that soup is god-level regression , which is more like is he for the team overall to make a sacrifice .
parker in the last season performed better than data reflected the better , not only because of his basket efficiency came to the career of the highest , he and aldridge chemical reaction also let the spurs benefit .
duncan to retire , manu ginobili announced battles a year , gdp combination also eventually come to an end , as the three individuals in the youngest one , the french sports car of the tank there is not much oil .
in got a third championship ring , only kareem , jordan and russell than james has won more regular season mvp , while jordan is the only one fmvp than james .
oh , by the way , james just for cleveland brought the past 52 years the first professional sports championship trophy .
come to the career the first 14 of the season , james needs to better ensure the physical , for the playoffs ready .
therefore , in the regular season , james &apos;s data is likely to further decline , he will put more of the burden given to owen to bear , but he will still easily be the league the top three players .

helen graf and heather stein ning subject suffering from a cancer of a coach to inspire , won a rowing gold medal
it is no exaggeration to say that this is the most let a person touched a piece of gold .
from the first paddle until the present time , helen graf and heather stein ning has accepted 220 times punitive pull include training , and they in estacio da lagoa won the gold medals have a more extraordinary sense .
although the paddle of only their two people , but on the ship there is one man--coach robin williams--the sound has been with them the impact of the second consecutive block woman double paddle olympic gold medal , this is the first british to reach this height of the rowing woman combination .
they have held a 39-field unbeaten record , has the absolute advantage .
what we see is that the two gifted athletes on the water grace the front row , but this is not the victory of all .
in each block rowing gold behind , there are many voluntary help of the people , it is their constant dedication to create a different , and which help the most is a 30 months ago learned that his suffering from cancer , don &apos;t know if he could live to see this day of the coach .
as he said , death at any time may come .
i suffered from bladder cancer , they did surgery .
if you do not do the surgery while the cancer cells will spread spread to the whole body .
thus , the situation would be much worse .
this will slightly change your perception .
williams in the 2013 12 months to be diagnosed with cancer .
fortunately , he was in the beginning of 2014 to start the treatment , the impact to a minimum , although in this case so it may not be appropriate .
i need to get to the salary , therefore i must hurry and get well .
this to me is an incentive .
i live in the hospital , although they say taking a few steps would be enough , but i still every time around the ward walking on 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet .
this is all a starting point .
the rowing motion itself is a journey , and it makes this journey becomes longer .
in gold the moment they first thought was williams . this morning the williams than the usual slightly talkative to some , this is in order to overcome his anxiety .
was a royal artillery team of stan ning after will go to afghanistan , she said : “ i this week &apos;s mood is very bad , may be a bit extreme , but this gold is indeed significant . ”
it repeatedly told me this is for me important , me , helen and robin pay a little effort .
this is helen , robin and i tried for three years to return .
if there is no robin , we &apos;re just nobodies , thank you very much , he is the world &apos;s best coaches .
i can &apos;t find him a better trainer and coach .
helen graf and heather stein ning in five years , haven &apos;t lost .
this combination of the setting of penalties their opponents can &apos;t match .
even in the last 500 meters , the new zealand team and the danish team started approaching , stan manning and graf still has a lot of physical reserves .
was really thrilling .
helen called : “ keep the rhythm , keep the rhythm . ”
not be the opponent the impact is indeed very important .
we have a good start , but we did not look forward to do what earth-shattering event .
we do not have to think about today &apos;s glory , we just want to plan every pitch and win this game , and we did .
this combination took a year to decide their own future .
graf next month with tv expedition member steve barker sal get married .
but now , she just wanted to enjoy the moment .
i don &apos;t want to say this is my last game .
this would bring me too much pressure .
in london , i spent about six months time before they realized i was the olympic champion .
this is a new experience , and i am very nervous .
now it has been about 4 minutes .
she said “ i feel so much better . ”

snapchat shows this filter was inspired by anime , but some observers believe it has racial overtones .
snapchat 1 . 5 million daily users through its filters tool to change reality and the portrait becomes comically ridiculous .
you can turn yourself into a pineapple , a dog or a roy lichtenstein painting in the role .
these lenses have a blunt , curved features of the effect , daily production of more than 3000 million through the modification of the selfie .
any mistake will be immediately public attention .

the company &apos;s explanation is : this filter is for the anime character tribute , rather than satire of the asian people .
but for experienced the racism of the viewer , the filter reminds them of the reality having a harmful stereotype .
others strongly opposed these anime image .
a name for these photos published to twitter and widely share the korean-american art students in an e-mail indicates , these filters “ at least people feel uncomfortable and discomfort . ”
she also said : “ it is difficult to distinguish between the extreme nausea of asia satirical image with the filter effect . ”
although filters not just yellow , but yellow is extremely demeaning .

from the company &apos;s board of directors to hollywood , and we carry equipment , american culture seems to have been in the promotion of diversity and inclusiveness .
snapchat huge young population since the ratio of the older generations pay more attention to ethnic diversity , and therefore may be very sensitive .
when snapchat one of the filters to produce a insult to the user &apos;s image , the 25-year-old zhu katie said in a thursday interview , said : “ compared to the previous , such things more difficult to escape people &apos;s line of sight . ”

other observers share her no is snapchat responded to the complaint .
the company did not publish about the employee diversity data , and expressing yourself is a private company .
on thursday , snapchat declined to discuss its employee &apos;s racial background , but a spokesman said the company recently hired a recruiter is specifically responsible for concern inside a lower proportion of the population as well as to promote internal inclusion efforts .

although there is no definitive evidence that the obama administration &apos;s senior officials ordered the changes of these reports , but according to the report below , these analysts feel that they have been from the central command leader of pressure , forcing them to the islamic state , isis or isil ) threat , issued a more optimistic opinion .
the report said , “ in the first half of 2015 , many of the central command &apos;s press releases , statements and congressional testimony than the actual situation much more optimistic . ”
for example , a central command officials publicly stated might be as early as 2015 4 months or 5 months take a large-scale military operation to recapture mosul .
iraq &apos;s second largest city of mosul are still in the islamic state under control .
kansas republican representative mike pompeo said in a statement : “ after months of investigation , the results have been very obvious . ”

the hearty meal of the great depression of the shabby food
1933 3 december , the just elected president franklin delano roosevelt sitting in the oval office for lunch .
as a foodie , president roosevelt , like the fifth avenue of cuisine , such as foie gras and maryland , stewed water fish .
that day , his menu is very simple : ketchup deviled eggs , mashed potatoes and as a dessert fruit pudding .
jean ziggy mann said : “ this is to on food and are suffering the people through thick and thin . ”
her husband , andrew , added : “ it also reflects the american way of eating . ”
this residence in brooklyn heights couple are food historians .
section mr. of the on a book the chop suey is about the american chinese restaurant , and ziggy mann lady in her the 97 orchard book by the food tells about the slum tenant of their life story .
together they have written a new book , a rich feast of will be in on tuesday by the harper publishing house , this book is the great depression united states food history .
in showcasing some of the food aspects of the common opinion upon them in the eisen berg &apos;s sandwich shop , met a journalist . this is located in the flatiron district of simple lunch counter from the 1929 economic crash when play has been operating until now .
54-year-old ziggy mann ms. ordered a cream cheese with chopped olive sandwich , and the 57-year-old , mr. point the turkey , mashed potatoes and vegetable platter .
the reporter ordered a meatloaf , the couple think these dishes are suitable for discussion during the great depression of the diet .
ziggy mann ms. says : “ at the time bread is very popular . ”
then there is peanut bread , liver , bread , soy bread .
they are used as a raw material and a pouring in of raw materials on the cheap toppings made .
imagine , you the dinner is peanuts .
section mr. dress up had a grimace on .
he said : “ they are in your stomach definitely just like the lead does . ”
in the great depression before the occurrence of a few years , americans meal meal is a buffet , especially in the suburbs .
a group of women for male farm workers cook breakfast , lunch and dinner are just test them out on the pie .
a war , exactly americans will be food to the hungry europeans . the hearty meal of record in this country is how to suddenly no longer become a prosperous .
mr. decaux explained why he and his wife to write this book : “ at the time , the food has become the order of americans unhappy with the main topic . ”
another unpleasant topic is a shabby new food : bread and stews , etc . “ fan of food ” has become the main dish , the stew is “ the best leftovers cooking way ” , mr. bergmann says ms. this is because chefs can use the sauce in the cream mask unpalatable ingredients .
fresh fruits are cheap dried fruit instead .
over the years have been americans on the table as the protagonist of the meat has become a rare luxury .
a strange hodgepodge of considering only calories , rather than taste , and even basic cooking common sense , people first consider is nutrition .
in the study of the book , including a variety of recipes in the process , ziggy mann ms. make a stuffed with peanut oil grilled onions .
mr. decaux said : “ this at the dinner table is not common . ”
ziggy mann ms. said : “ this is too strange . ”
peanut oil with grilled onion simply can &apos;t match .
this is where many of the family economy meal characteristics .
home economists to influence the country &apos;s eating habits , for example , from 1923 to 1943 as the federal home economic bureau chef lewis stanley et al , which in history is unique .
them in newspapers and magazines publish recipes and articles that encourage women to “ budget ” and have the courage to put the cream pasta with carrots and other bad food into cuisine .
the hearty meal is a hearty “ history of jane taste ” it .
particularly interesting is the government for the hungry people of the response , such as the president of the public herbert hoover “ someone else &apos;s things i can &apos;t control ” attitude .
although he publicly praised the childhood simple the iowa farmhouse , but his diet was like the millionaires are generally exquisite .
mr. decaux said : “ he likes to eat european-style western food , such as fish , accompanied with cucumber sauce ” is .
he was wearing an evening dress , in a gilt restaurant dining .
he apparently broke away from the people .
if not wife eleanor encouraged him on a diet to set an example , president roosevelt may also be guilty of the same error .
as the book said , roosevelt ms. the hiring of a housekeeper for the taste of no interest , and therefore the white house “ the food is not only washington &apos;s most unappetizing food , and more is cooking worst food . ”
when the united states a return to formal , many depression-era cooking methods will be abandoned .
ziggy mann said ms. , the leaves of our calories and nutrition concerns , as well as the science applied to cooking .
this couple represents in writing this book , they further learned about ziggy mann ms. mother &apos;s eating habits , such as how she does not put the food discarded .
mr. decaux said : “ she is very afraid of wasting food . ”
ziggy mann ms. recalls : “ she actually made many people a disease . ”
such as ever happened with the “ cream puff ” event .
at removed the plates after she and mr. come up with them at home to prepare a dessert : this is what president roosevelt at lunch in the eating of the fruit pudding .
ziggy mann ms. said : “ this is known as butter fruit , “ and adds as a common dish from a trendy name is a “ usual trick ” is .
this dessert without whipped cream , only fruit , a little flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
we all bite the bullet in the spoon deep into a thick brown paste .
unexpectedly , this dessert taste good .
mr. decaux also eat a second spoon , the third spoon .
he thinks this is a acceptable and affordable dessert , then told the wife : “ add some chopped walnuts would be more delicious . ”

nasa climate model : venus was habitable
according to nasa &apos;s new climate model predicted that venus was fit for human habitation .
nasa goddard institute for space studies , the scientists developed a can be out of venus past the situation of the model , the model is the use of the tools and algorithms of the climate scientists use are very similar .
the model is used to determine the surface temperature , anhydrous and the atmosphere is filled with carbon dioxide of venus ever have similar to the earth &apos;s environment .
previously , scientists thought that venus &apos;s rotation is slow is because its atmosphere is thicker .
but the latest simulations suggest that venus may have once had a thinner , similar to the earth &apos;s atmosphere and at the time of the rotation speed also slower .
the model also can display the venus of the early terrain .
venus dry areas may than the earth and more , but there was enough water and the geographical variation to nurture life and to prevent rapid evaporation .
early irradiation in the venus on the sun brighter than the earth dark by 30 % .
goddard institute for space studies scientist anthony del genio at the press conference explained : “ in the goddard institute for space studies model simulation , the venus the slow rotation so that one side of the time of day for almost two months . ”
this makes the surface warming and can be formed thick clouds of rain , thick clouds is like an umbrella , like to the ground blocking most of the sun &apos;s heat .
the result of the simulation is the venus the average climate temperature is in fact higher than now the earth is also lower by a few degrees .
the model is the simulation of the venus evolution and before planetary scientists speculate that the similar .
although venus may have once harbor life , but in billions of years of process , the venus is exposed in the high temperature and ultraviolet .
the planet &apos;s oceans evaporate , the water vapor is also uv burn .
as the hydrogen escapes , leaving only a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere and the deadly greenhouse effect , and thus the formation we know today as venus .
researchers in the geophysical research letters journal published the new venus climate model simulation results .

the union said its recent actions were taken in order to protest the maximum may reach 30 % pay cut , and this is a union 25 for the first time since taking this action .
wood group this year due to market pressures and the north sea , the contractor &apos;s remuneration is reduced by about 9 percent .
the pay cut before the company in 2014 will be the offshore contractor &apos;s remuneration is reduced by 10 % .
the company represents , again , the pay cuts will help the company through the market recession of the storm .
shell has laid off thousands of employees and announced plans to shut down 10 countries of oil and gas equipment , this is because the company with the uk energy company british gas group , after the merger the need to streamline its business .
energy companies are facing from the oil price decline and the uk june off to europe to decide the pressure .

in 2016 , the north sea new item of expenditure not expected to exceed 14 billion dollars , and over the past five years , the average project expenditure to reach about 70 billion dollars .
kepler measured leone sink star clusters stellar rotation speed
the kepler space telescope &apos;s latest mission has helped astronomers capture the most complete of the expensive sink star clusters stellar rotation speed .
the new data are helping astronomers understand why the cluster of stars with different rotation speed and rotation period of the planet consisting of the association .
pasadena california institute of technology infrared processing and analysis center , research scientist lu sa · ray boolean at the press conference , said : “ we hope that through the comparison of our results with other clusters to further understand the stellar mass , age , and even its solar system history between the relationship . ”
expensive the sink cluster distance from earth 445 light years .
the star clusters of many stars are born in about 1 . 25 million years ago , is currently just reaching adulthood .
they reached the lifetime maximum rotation speed .
after reaching the highest rotation speed , these mature stars emitted large amounts of stellar wind .
when these stellar winds through the stellar magnetic field , they will for stars to produce the braking action .
with the sidereal age increases , the rotation speed began to slow down .
kepler by tracking recognizable stars black child as sunspots appear , the time measurement of the sun &apos;s rotation speed .
the latest of the rotation velocity data set show that the larger mass of the stellar rotation speed is slower than the smaller mass stars .
ray boolean the stars likened to a dancer , the larger of the dancers when the rotation speed is slower than the smaller dancers .
ray , boolean , said : “ in the leon sink cluster ‘ ballet performances ’ , we find that the rotation speed of the slower stars are often larger mass , and the rotation speed of the fastest stars are often the most light of the stars . ”
due to the expensive sink cluster distance is near , and therefore can be used as a comparison of the stellar mass and the rotation speed of the ideal cosmic laboratory .
ray , boolean , said : “ the leon sink cluster for the young and old stellar two-way rotation of the theoretical model laid the foundation . ”
about the stars , how , when and why to slow down the rotation speed and the “ stowed their shoes ” , we still have many need to understand knowledge .
ray , boolean , and her colleagues in three new paper detailed in the leon sink cluster rotation speed of the latest analysis . the three papers will soon be published in the astronomical journal .
