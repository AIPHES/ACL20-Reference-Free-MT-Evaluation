primary doctor strike : appeal for new labor operations
the solicitor &apos; s representative called on the union to ratify its new labor action on the new contract dispute .
the council of primary doctors of the british medical association will require its members to support more labor operations since the beginning of september .
the junior doctors committee said the ministers did not settle the deal &apos; s concerns about the contract .
the primary doctors and medical students voted for the contract deal between the british medical association and the british medical association .
of the members involved , 58 % of the members opposed the contract .
in a letter to twitter on thursday night , , chairman of the primary health care committee , said the government had &quot; always been silent &quot; on issues that led to the boycott of contracts &quot; .
&quot; in view of that , the executive committee of the junior medical commission has voted to reject the proposed new contract and call for renewed formal consultations on all concerns , &quot; she said . &quot;
in response to the government &apos; s silence , the executive committee of the junior doctors committee today formally requested the council of the british medical association to convene a special session of the council to approve a long - term plan aimed at upgrading labor operations from september .
the dispute has resulted in junior doctors participating in six strikes this year , including the first full - scale strike in history of the uk &apos; s national medical service .
dr. , head of primary health association of the british medical association , resigned after voting on the terms of the contract recommended by the british medical association .
in a meeting before the 54,000 junior doctors and medical students , he told members of the british medical association that the deal was good and should be accepted .
after the vote , health minister said the contract would be enforced in english medical personnel .
russia and turkey &quot; ？
a gesture ends a crisis .
russia and turkey &apos; s leaders met on tuesday , and the two sides shook hands and announced the formal end of the eight - month spat and economic sanctions .
however , when vladimir putin greeted the turkish president in the splendid hall of a holy peter palace , i had a strong feeling that this reconciliation was the most promising of ankara .
yes , the two sides did shake hands .
however , even in accordance with the standard of mr putin &apos; s long - standing standards , putin is just a shallow smile , almost with enthusiasm .
erdoğan , it is reported , was five times referring to his &quot; good friend &quot; putin .
i can &apos; t remember .
at the same time , he promised that relations with russia would return to the level before the crisis and even higher levels .
the next day , the newspaper wrote that mr erdogan seemed to have acted as if nothing had happened .
but i think his enthusiasm implies something opposite .
however , mr putin &apos; s persistent indifference to the attitude of mr putin shows that he has never forgotten anything .
in fact , the first thing he mentioned in the opening line was the cause of the crisis : turkey had shot down a russian fighter on the syrian border .
moscow was at the time .
mr putin launched a fierce attack against the incident and accused ankara of being behind moscow .
attacks from so-called friends are even more difficult to accept .
it is difficult and impossible for both parties to re - establish genuine trust .
russian public opinion has also reversed from november .
for months , the government - controlled media had made a shocking attack on ankara .
suddenly , the turks seem to be responsible for everything .
among them , the most serious are the accusations from senior officials : mr. erdogan &apos; s family benefits from illegal oil deals in the syrian region controlled by the islamic state .
he has categorically denied the claim .
however , the message from st peter shows that it is time to look forward .
after all , the meeting was based on the premise that putin received an apology from turkey &apos; s president recep tayyip erdoğan .
russia can declare victory .
the benefits of a truce are obvious to ankara .
first , erdoğan had nearly been ousted from a coup in last month &apos; s coup , and he needed the support of all his friends .
the constant terrorist attacks had apparently been a great blow to him .
there is also economic motivation .
russian sanctions have been a big blow to turkey , especially in the ban on the charter services that can deliver millions of russian tourists to turkey &apos; s coast each year .
the number has fallen sharply to nearly 90 % per cent % .
as flights resumed , russian travel agents and charter companies would be relieved .
they will usher in a wave of mediterranean tourism .
state television is even predicting this week that the price of fruit and vegetables will fall once turkey &apos; s imports .
&quot; tourists went , and the tomatoes came back , &quot; said a report in the newspaper in moscow . &quot;
for moscow , the visit also has extra political value .
ankara is angry at the western world &apos; s response to a weak response to the intentions of the takeover .
moreover , ankara is dissatisfied with the slow progress of accession to the european union and putin &apos; s involvement in the long run , and putin is keen to take advantage of political chill and weaken turkey &apos; s relationship with the west .
as a result of the defeat of the coup d &apos; at , russia &apos; s leaders will surely receive ankara &apos; s bonus point .
note that this is a gift to moscow , which has been deeply entrenched in regime change .
so , at a meeting held in this magnificent seaside palace , russia and turkey are allies of the two countries that russia and turkey have been rejected and abused by the west , and an analyst described it as a &quot; league &quot; .
however , despite the public reconciliation , there are significant differences between the two sides .
syria is one of the key factors , and moscow has played a role in syria in recent days , while russia and turkey support the opposite faction .
it is predictable that , after nearly three hours of preliminary talk , the two presidents said at the conference that the subject had not yet been talked about .
the turkish president deliberately avoided the issue of disagreement , while putin emphasized it .
there is no clear consensus on how to seek common ground between the two sides on the syrian issue .
it will certainly be a good thing that the leaders of the north atlantic treaty organization , turkey , shot down a few months of public hostility and triggered a massive disaster .
the royal bank of scotland will no longer serve outside scotland
the bank will be simplified as a logistic unit , according to the royal bank &apos; s chief executive .
the royal bank of scotland will no longer serve customers outside scotland .
rose told the bbc scottish branch that rbs &apos; s brand was committed to its global ambitions .
but eight years ago , when it was close to bankruptcy , relief had to be taken from the beginning , since then , to abandon that pursuit .
that time , the brand strategist used &apos; rbs &apos; to protect other consumer finance brands .
the group has spent millions of pounds in sponsoring international sporting events in the form of andy murray , the six - nation championship and tennis championships .
but now , the right way is to get more national brands to emerge .
the royal bank of scotland will be used for scottish customers but will not return to it .
in england and wales , all references outside the headquarters and the stock exchange are to be changed to the national bank .
the banking brand has been used by clients in the republic of ireland and northern ireland .
there are also other more prominent smaller private banking brands such as the bank , adam &amp; co , and &apos; s bank .
mr was interviewed for his visit to his clients and staff in county .
&quot; the royal bank of scotland will eventually become our investor brand and one of the employees , because at the present time we have become a bank with a large number of brands , &quot; he told the bbc . &quot;
because the bank itself becomes an international brand , rbs has become a global brand .
at the moment , i want to say that we are no longer focused on the world and we have turned our eyes to home .
each brand represents the different industry , and our employees serve customers through different brands .
the royal bank of scotland has shown that it will not continue to sponsor the six - nation championship ; at the same time , efforts have been made to improve the image of different brands in sports events .
chief executive said : &quot; now it &apos; s time for a multi - brand bank , because privately we have been exploring how to become a better service to the bank . &quot;
if we decided to be a big bank with a large number of brands three years ago , it would be a mockery of our own .
at the moment , we focus on customer needs and i am sure you have noticed these changes .
i think we can restart these brands , and now it &apos; s the right time .

bo ge , the champion , has won 4,493 victories in his career as a communist party champion
is one of the greatest jockey of the day , so it is not surprising that he has made this milestone , and there are not many people who have made it before .
he was fashionable and robust , but he was rational in the weighing room that really made him stand out in the weighing room .
he was a great equestrian ambassador for many years , and his enthusiasm and charm attracted a large number of fans for the sport .
a few weeks ago , i said in and , if he wasn &apos; t just a jockey for the weekend , he would have won 6,000 victories ！
indeed , it was too important to say that was the best equestrian winner of $ number years in the united kingdom .
he was lively , and it was good for the british race , but in addition he was an incredible jockey .

his career was a roller coaster ride .
he won the championship , including 1996 , the famous &quot; seven - streak &quot; of the royal in the united kingdom , but he was also hit by a plane crash .
three years ago , when he was back in six months after the six - month ban , he had been struggling , but he showed an amazing character and finally returned to the top of his .
he may not be able to do it for a long time - - he said before he had said that he hoped to compete at least before the age .
russian president vladimir putin has released the post of director of sergei &apos; s office
russian president vladimir putin has unexpectedly lifted the post of president of the presidential office of sergei .
over the years , mr. has been a member of the core of mr. putin &apos; s trusted core group .
, $ number , is now appointed as the special representative for the environment and traffic .
a statement from the kremlin said mr. putin had &quot; announced the release of the head of the russian president &apos; s office in , &quot; but did not give the reason .
anton , 2012 , who began to be mr. &apos; s deputy , has been appointed as his successor .
mr. , a former diplomat , is a former diplomat .
he was born at the estonian capital of , graduated from the famous moscow national institute of international relations ( ) , who worked in the tokyo embassy .
later , he managed the draft president and the government staff , the kremlin website ( using russian ) said .
after his appointment , he said to mr putin , &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
i think this government &apos; s most important task is to support the heads of state to draft laws and control instructions to be implemented .
mr putin told russian television on friday that mr. had asked to resign and recommended mr. to take over as himself .
is such a smile convincing ？
moscow was puzzled by the move .
for a long time , sergei was one of putin &apos; s closest associates , working as putin , in the soviet security council ( kgb .
as director of the office , he was one of the most influential people in the country .
on a meeting with president vladimir putin , on the national television , both were called the director of the office and asked to resign .
while the camera was full of smiles , few were convinced - especially at the time of the parliamentary elections .
so , is this the result of a sort of power struggle ？
it is not yet known .
however , the official statement - a person who had been seen as the presidential candidate - suddenly chose to steer russia &apos; s environmental policy - - which has attracted many doubts .
mr. , on the kremlin &apos; s web site , cited mr. &apos; s dialogue with mr. putin , saying : &quot; yes , i asked you to give me this difficult job in a dialogue , even in a position of trouble , and even a four - year term . &quot;
&quot; as a result , i have been the president of the presidency for eight years and eight months . &quot;
mr was in this position on december 2011 .
before that , he served as deputy prime minister and minister of defense .
he is a member of the russian security council and is the same as mr. putin , a former member of the national security council .
at the end of 1990s , when mr putin was a director of the federal security council ( , formerly known as the national security bureau ) , mr. was appointed as his deputy .
after mr putin came to power , he appointed mr. as one of his most trusted five .
mr was once thought to be the president of russia after the end of his second term in office , because three - term re - election was a violation of the constitution .
but the position eventually belonged to putin &apos; s other intimate aide , dmitry medvedev ) .
mr putin served as russian prime minister before his re - presidency in three and a half years .
a garden of mystery fish
a resident of found a fish in his garden and then asked for help .
kevin thinks the may be a that has been blown by a sea tornado .
mr , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , released a video of this strange scene on , hoping someone would explain why these 2 inch - long fish had come to him .
bridge is now available
the project , which was about $ 1.35 billion , was planned to be completed on may 2017
engineers have linked the bridge to the bridge and the overhead bridge , which means that the bridge is now through .
the , near three of each bridge , is now close to completion , and the project is headed by a bridge .
the bridge , starting from , is 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tonnes .
it uses 10,000 metric tons of steel , 20,000 metric tons of concrete and .
the $ 1.35 billion project is planned to be completed on may 2017 .
economic minister keith brown , who visited the scene today , became one of the first people to climb the bridge .
&quot; this is a historic moment in the construction of the bridge , &quot; he said . &quot;
we are all witness to the engineering work on such a grand project , which uses more than 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel in this part of the bridge .
although the bridge &apos; s size and weight are enormous , the completion of the bridge between the viaduct and the deck is needed for fine work , requiring very precise assembly .
in general , nearly 79 % per cent of the total deck is now installed and the concrete deck of the last section of the bridge is now pouring in , which is to say that all the bridges are ready for placement .
&quot; the first is a major milestone , &quot; said michael martin , the project director of the bridge construction company . &quot;
in the case of the great project , the is the front - line civil engineering technique .
when you install the last section of the road panel and connect it to the expanded road panel , you will need to complete the remaining gap on the side of the north or close to the side of the land .
the completion of the operation would require the north of the 700 mm .
it was a big homework , and it was a very sophisticated job at the same time .
to say it is huge , because the viaduct is 222 meters long , weighs about 6,000 metric tons , and needs to pull out of a margin of about 3 .
it is precise because the engineering team needs to make sure that the deviation is very small , with only a few millimeters per side .
it is gratifying that everything is going well .
simon won the women &apos; s gymnastics all - round championship
forget about the pressure .
forget about the hype .
simon is not affected by all this .

the balance beam is easy to handle .
exercise of free gymnastics is amazing .
the overall performance is very exciting .
now , it has finally become the olympic champion .
the american gymnast picked up the all - round championship on thursday in the olympic stadium showing her talent for the world in gymnastics .
she was 62.198 per cent far above the silver medalist , &quot; the ultimate five group &quot; ( ) and the bronze medal winner ) .
simon from the united states performed a balanced wooden performance on thursday in rio de janeiro , brazil , at the artistic gymnastics women &apos; s individual all - round final in rio de janeiro , brazil .
helped the u . s . team in the olympic games women &apos; s gymnastics individual all - round , she won five medals in the games , and further confirmed that she was this generation , and probably the best gymnast in the world .

there was a final match in brazil , but the match was not so much the competition of and the other gymnasts as a contest between herself and the great expectation of pressure .
if did not return to her home in sprint , texas , everyone would be very disappointed .
simon ( left ) and from the united states have embraced gold and silver medals in the artistic gymnastics women &apos; s finals of the summer olympic games held in rio de janeiro , brazil on august .
won the first gold medal on tuesday , giving his retired national team coach a surprise award .
although insists that he does not plan for the future in the long term , the fact is not entirely the case .
one part of &apos; s free gymnastics , including her iconic , was accompanied by latin music , which she had often heard in her house on a street of the rio olympic stadium .
this is no coincidence .
the girl , discovered by his grandparents in the infancy of a baby period , and on a field trip to the stadium , has now grown to be the backbone of her mother &apos; s mother , amy .
since 2013 , has not lost in the all - round competition , so she will win if she wants to win it .
&apos;s lead was a mere illusion after two times of rotation .

she blew kisses from the crowd at the end of her free gymnastics and announced the return , but it sometimes seems to be in doubt .

brown &apos; s , a , was immune to the shooting in philadelphia
police say a six - year - old boy was shot in philadelphia , a six - year - old boy in the city &apos; s second shot in the city .
the child &apos; s grandparents confirmed that the shot was brown .
they say brown &apos; s groin , leg , arm and abdomen have several gunshot wounds , but the child is sober on the way to the hospital .
&quot; he was guilty of a lot of crime , and his little body was hit by bullets , &quot; his grandmother , , said to the tv station .
i can &apos; t believe it .
the boy &apos; s situation in the hospital was critical and he had been treated for several times .
his family told the television that the child was expected to recover .
he was supposed to have started in a local primary school for the first grade .
brown is one of the four men who have been shot in the area .
among the other three who were shot , the two were three years old and one of them was .
according to cbs , one of the victims of the age of $ number is at risk ; the other two victims are stable .
the child was found on the front seat of a car , the television said .
two other victims were not in the car , and the police were investigating whether there were gunmen in the injury .
the investigators told cbs , looking like a number of gunmen in a fire .
the scene found a number of shells , which can be inferred that they are using a different weapon .
judging from this , there is no doubt that this is a continuing battle .
there were shells on the sidewalk on both sides of the street .
&quot; so there were a number of fighters at the scene of the scene , &quot; , director of police in philadelphia , said on the television .
a number of houses and vehicles have been damaged in the area .
arrests have not yet been carried out , and the police are said to be looking at surveillance videos .
on tuesday , a six - year - old child , a six - year - old child ( girl ) , was ejected from the arm when she was playing at the door of the home of the community .
she is recovering , and the police are still chasing the suspect .
why we need simon , and laurie
this is the way i judge the women &apos; s olympic gymnastics team this year , for more than one reason .
first , from 1984 , i have been to every summer olympic games , but the united states has never been so dominant .
second , the gymnastics team has three excellent gymnasts , simon , douglas and laurie , who have been encouraging a number of colored girls .
the composition of the team makes everyone proud , for it contains the jewish ali and the catholic madison ) .
the team finally looked like the u . s . team .
it has also consolidated black and latino women at the top of the sport .
in the past four years , the leading female gymnasts have been african - american .
last year , simon and were listed first and second .
it &apos; s too strong .
in the last olympic games , douglas &quot; unexpectedly &quot; became the olympic champion , and the united states cheered .
today , the world is able to witness the performance of three world champion simon , douglas and laurie , who the routine gymnastics skills .
on thursday , simon helped the united states achieve four consecutive titles in the women &apos; s individual all - around project .
her teammate , ali , won the silver medal .
we were on the top of the sport , but not so on the class of gymnastics teaching in the united states .
simon , , and laurie entered the olympic team &apos; s way as ali and madison .
they are the ultimate five - person group , because the next olympic gymnastics team will be composed of four gymnasts , a last - year coach .
but the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport , and the gymnasts are trained mainly in private gymnastic clubs , and their parents need to pay for training , facilities , travel , clothing , competition and hotel costs ( including coaches and gym fees .
most of the gymnastics clubs are located in the rich suburbs of the industry that provide support to the industry .
all of the training of the gymnast is completed in these clubs , and it is a long - term expensive expense for the gymnast &apos; s family .
&apos;s coach , amy and &apos; s coach , , have been teaching them since the two gymnasts began to practice gymnastics .
we must bring more affordable , more accessible gymnastics training to young girls who are deeply influenced by simon , and laurie .
five years ago , i set up my own gymnastics foundation .
in my organization , we provide free , low - cost gymnastics to more than 15,000 urban youth ( mainly black and hispanic americans ) in my organization , and cultivate national and world champions .
september we will expand to detroit ( my hometown ) to provide high - quality gymnastics to young people who deserve this learning opportunity and will benefit from this great olympic movement .
it helps to cultivate the strength , flexibility and coordination of the body , and also helps to develop the spirit , self - discipline and determination of the hard - working spirit .
these can lead to life - long benefits for a person &apos; s health , education , and success in work .
inspired by the team , thousands of young girls will learn gymnastics , which is really great .
it is important to participate in the movement , especially for girls .
it was an exciting time .
thanks to simon , ali , lao rui , , and madison to win the gold medal of the olympic group , they also thanked them for motivating so many young girls with different backgrounds to open their path to health , greatness and success .
after jeremy hunt &apos; s proposal , the plans to launch a further strike
the ministers initially hoped to end the dispute with the revised contract of the british medical association ( ) , but 37,000 of the 58 % primary doctors participating in the vote were opposed to the contract .
mr. hunter disclosed a contract to enforce the contract , saying that the nhs was currently in a &quot; vacuum , &quot; which would damage the interests of employees and patients .
the new contract first refers to the modification of the work of primary doctors to work night and weekend , in order to improve the care of non - normal working hours .
in a statement last night , dr. , chairman of the , said in a statement that &quot; the primary doctors have serious concerns about the proposed contract , especially because it will exacerbate the current labor crisis and have failed to treat all doctors with justice . &quot;
we have only eight weeks to sign a new contract for the first doctors , and we need to make progress , not much time .
tried to settle the dispute through a negotiated settlement , but everyone was reluctant to participate , and sometimes the government was in silence .
even so , we got jeremy hunt &apos; s promise last month , and he said his door was open .
&quot; jeremy hunt will now need to take action to cancel the enforcement of compulsory enforcement and solve the primary doctor &quot; concerns .
if he does not , the junior doctor has made it clear that they are ready to take further labor action .
the last strike took place at the end of april , leading to an extension of 13,000 routine surgery and 100,000 cases , as nurses and consultants cover doctors on .
the ministers initially hoped to end the change - induced dispute by accepting the contract .
hopes to get a better weekend wage for the 54,000 junior doctors involved in the contract .
daniel , chief executive of the nhs , called on the primary doctor to stop the strike .
mr said : &quot; the labor action is very small , but it will result in pressure on the already dedicated teams and services , leading to anxiety , anxiety and confusion among patients , nurses and their families . &quot;
in the past two months , we have been negotiating with the junior doctors commission and actively responding to the concerns of the ministry of health and other sectors on their guardian roles and reports .
employers hope to continue to actively explore other important topics - such as deployment , training flexibility , other training costs , training costs , training programmes for students , education and health care in the course of the health of the health care sector , including those of the health education organization ( ) and the ministry of health ( england .
$ number . a daily dose of can reduce the risk of a heart attack
officials suggest that a drug in the day - to - day be extended to more patients and to extend the medication , thousands of heart disease patients will benefit from the drug .
( ) can reduce the risk of heart disease recurrence in patients with heart disease .
the drug continues to take $ number months after the heart attack and reduces the risk of a stroke or heart attack .
the national health and clinical research institute ( nhs ) , a national health and clinical research institute ( ) , advises patients to take four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease .
but now , , the nhs regulator , advises patients to continue taking four years for the patient in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease .
in england , about 140,000 people are suffering from heart disease each year , and 1 / 4 of them continue to suffer from a heart attack or have a stroke .
a heart attack and stroke is caused by the formation of in the arterial wall of the arterial wall .
if the plaque is broken , it can cause a clot , and then hinder the flow of blood into the heart , causing a heart attack .
if the thrombus moves , it goes into the blood flow , blocking the flow of blood into the brain , leading to a stroke .
once a patient with a heart attack has been experienced , the risk of a heart attack is higher in heart attack .
, made by , the british company , sold for the name of , which could reduce the risk of thrombosis by reducing the formation of thrombosis .
the draft released today recommended that patients take for a month and then take and two aspirin every day for the next three years .
professor , director of health technology assessment center , said : &quot; although there are effective secondary prevention treatment , more than 1 / 4 patients with a history of heart attack may have serious consequences once more . &quot;
the fear of recurrence has a great negative impact on the quality of life of a person .
evidence suggests that taking with aspirin can effectively reduce the risk of a recurrence of heart disease and stroke in patients with a heart attack .
we are gratified by the fact that the provisional recommendation of will offer more therapeutic options for the people of thousands of beneficiaries .
because of the efficacy and safety of in three years , especially the information on the risk of bleeding , the draft guidelines do not recommend the continuation of their treatment after that period .
computer culture leading to the prevalence of &quot; electoral fraud &quot;
, former mayor of , has been by corruption last year , prompting a government report to be published .
the culture of &quot; political correctness &quot; has caused widespread election fraud in muslim communities , which is revealed today by an anti - personnel government report .
former cabinet minister eric ( eric ) accuses the police , the electoral regulator and the city hall of the evidence of the abuse of elections because of &quot; excessive sensitivity to racial divisions and religious issues .
the former minister for community affairs , the incumbent and the current icac officer , said the police should be allowed to set up a cordon outside the polling station in order to protect the frightened electorate .
he suggested that voters carry their identity cards in order to confirm their identity when they vote .
at the moment , voters simply have to report their names and addresses .
the report even suggests wiping the finger on the electorate &apos; s fingers to prevent a second vote .

we asked , a master of the new york city &apos; s alliance , to learn how to deal closely with gunmen .
whether he is from the front or close to you , the video will teach you how .
if the gunmen come near you , says , the first thing you have to do is turn around so that you can see the attackers and &quot; clear the lines &quot; .
next , use the forearm and shoulder to hold the gun , and then strike the attacker on the face with your elbow .
next he took his knee over his groin , reversing the gun in his hand , beating his face with a gun tube and a back - gun group , and kept his arms on him .
if the shooter comes out of the front , and with a similar skill - - let your body go out of the line of fire , seize the gun and reverse the muzzle so that the shooter can &apos; t open fire .
at the same time , weigh the weight on the gun and hit the attacker on the chest and turn the gun from the hand that he holds tightly and aim the gun at him .
that sounds complicated ？
check the video to see how the works .
but remember , if you &apos; re not the master of , the safest way to get out of the robbery is to give it up .

china &apos; s mars project is coming
the mission of mars exploration in our country will be carried out in a circle , landing and patrol , which has never been in the foreign country .
our country &apos; s mars exploration target is to think about a step , landing , and patrol , and this task is quite difficult .
because the mars probe will have to meet a time window for six months , experts are working closely to launch plans to launch our first mars detector in the window of 2020 .
although our aircraft has entered a deep space , the completion of the mars exploration mission is still essential , according to xu dazhe , which means that china has entered a real sense of the year .
&quot; once a couple of years or three years , mars is the most recent opportunity to launch a mars probe at this time - point for the launch of the launch rocket . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the quality of the mars detector , we will have the launch of a rocket launched by the long march of our country to complete the launch mission . &quot;
our country &apos; s mars exploration mission is to achieve the circle , the landing and the patrol , which have never been in the foreign country , but the landing has failed .
there is a lot of technology in mars , and the special place is that , while the mars vehicle is a space detector , it has distinct features compared with general space detectors .
that is to say , the mars detector has the ability to determine the traveling route and to discover the dangers of the barrier .
, a researcher pang zhihao the china space science and technology group , said the human being is so popular with mars because it has important scientific and technological implications , and even related to the future of mankind .
now that mars has become the highest human research planet beyond earth , the history of the human space probe is almost throughout the history of human space , using space detectors for the exploration of mars .
so , man wants to build a living base in mars and eventually migrate to mars and turn it into the second home of mankind .
there is also a lot of signs that mars may have been like the present earth before , just a few billion years of evolution into the atmosphere , low temperature , water supply , and so on .
as a result , detection or manned landing on mars could make a plan to prevent the planet from becoming the second planet that could hardly survive .
as of june 2016 , a total of 114 lunar probes have been carried out , and mars exploration .
however , from 1990s to date , a total of $ number mars missions have been carried out by human beings , and lunar exploration has only been carried out .
at present there is a mars orbiter and a mars rover in work , but only a lunar orbiter and a lunar in work .
the world &apos; s largest space powers have set up a reconnaissance plan aimed at the mars system , which shows that today &apos; s mars exploration is hotter than the lunar probe .
november 5 , 2013 , india launched its first mars probe , , and became the first country to explore mars in asia .
was used to study the surface , atmosphere and mineral characteristics of mars , and to explore whether there were methane and signs of life on mars .
the hardest part of the mission is that the detector enters the martian atmosphere and has only one chance to move into a pneumatic shape and a parachute deceleration
the mission is facing many technical challenges , according to , the head sun zezhou the department of mars exploration , the total department of the china space science and technology group company .
the atmospheric pressure on mars is very low , with only 1 % of atmospheric pressure on the earth &apos; s surface , and is highly uncertain .
scientists have not yet fully understood the factors such as its changes and the characteristics of the storm .
mars has often formed a dust storm that is similar to the dust of the earth in the summer , which will result in a sharp drop in the solar energy received by the mars vehicle , which must be designed for mars vehicles to wait patiently for the dust .
at the same time , the martian atmosphere also has a role in reducing the sun &apos; s light , which poses a difficult problem for the energy supply to mars .
this requires the probe &apos; s solar wing to be larger and to be constantly adjusted to try to focus on the sun .
in addition , the surface of mars is only 38 % of the earth &apos; s surface , but more than the gravity of the surface of the moon , so the detector needs more power .
&quot; the most important and difficult part of the mars exploration mission is that the probe enters into the air of the mars atmosphere and slows down , and only once , and must ensure success . &quot;
sun zezhou the earth is far away from mars , the whole process cannot be controlled by the ground , so it must depend on the detector to complete it , said .
as there are not so many to offset such a high speed , the landing on mars depends on the atmosphere of mars &apos; s atmosphere , but the martian atmosphere is difficult to simulate on the ground .
in general , the search for mars is similar to the way in the moon to explore the moon , and it is &quot; winding , falling , and returning , &quot; pang zhihao said .
as mars is far more remote from the earth than the moon , the exploration of mars needs to conquer a series of more complex technical difficulties .
according to taiwanese media , lin quan , the president of the administration , announced yesterday morning that the improper acquisition of property by parties and their organizations came into effect today .
wang zhan qixian , vice - chairman of the kuomintang , said : &quot; a one hundred - year - old kuomintang , a social commitment and responsibility , will not fail to do so &quot; .

he said that , in the absence of the , mr gu li would be a non - candidate , and to borrow hong peigen &apos; s experience in the past to examine major cases related to major cases , which would serve as the basis of the committee &apos; s inventory of inappropriate cases .
zhan qixian believes that today there is no one who will give you a social donation , and if all of them are confiscated , the kuomintang could ask for social support and sponsorship , &quot; today is not the only time to have a chance &quot; .
zhan qixian also stressed that the kuomintang was not completely confiscated and confiscated after the launch of the ordinance , and the rest would continue to commit to zero , and the party would start at zero .

zhang huizhen won the gold medal at the women &apos; s archery competition in the women &apos; s archery competition in rio de janeiro , brazil .
she was first shot at the primary school in fourth grade , not the first time in the world cup to win a solo gold medal in the world cup .
zhang huizhen recalls , &quot; there was so little level of high school before that it would not be able to compete in the country .
zhang huizhen was only fourth in the london olympic games four years ago , and lost the olympic ticket , only to allow his colleague and friend to win two gold medals .
zhang huizhen the end of the ceremony , spoke of his gold medal at the end of the award ceremony for women &apos; s archery individual competition . &quot; it was a good result that could be a good result , &quot; he said .

lost to zhang huizhen in the semi - finals , with mexico &apos; s alexander valencia , the bronze medal of bronze , in the bronze medal .
in order to ensure a bronze medal in the tear after the bronze medal , it is conceivable that the burden of silence is conceivable .

although it has not yet been confirmed , many sources say apple will be held in september , when it will be held in 2016 .
although apple has not responded , the function , configuration , and configuration of the new iphone have been released in succession , and even a picture of the &quot; real machine &quot; is available .
the new generation of the iphone is &quot; the eye of the people &quot; , hot , hot , rich , and rich . . . if you want to buy it for the first time , you must choose a good channel , such as su ning .
this has added to the disappointment of the new mobile phone , &quot; it has been extended , but it doesn &apos; t have the holographic image ! the iphone is terrible . &quot;
, like the other iphone , has been accompanied by innumerable before birth .
in addition , there are multiple sources claiming that the new iphone will cancel the 5mm earphone interface and use a bluetooth connection and a charging interface , which will provide space for apple to add a second speaker .
another evidence that can support this message is that early 2014 , apple allows a headset to produce headphones that are connected via a charging interface .
the messages are true or false , and the answer will be found only until the fall of apple in the autumn of 2016 .
but that does not prevent the industry from looking forward to the prospect of - many believe that will be likely to be the last big jump in apple &apos; s iphone series .
while the iphone &apos; s market share has declined from a recent market study , the market share of the iphone has fallen .
goldman , gao sheng goldman sachs group , kept apple &apos; s shares in a &quot; buy &quot; rating , while &apos; s analysts said would reap a historic sales achievement .
meanwhile , the company &apos; s ceo , , said apple &apos; s future earnings growth would likely exceed 20 % per cent , which fully benefited from the introduction .
some 7 % percent of respondents said they had plans to buy , compared with a 4 % per cent increase in the number of people planned to purchase two years ago % .
it is understood that 20 % per cent of users currently holding or have $ number plans to buy , which is a fairly high proportion .
second , there are expert analysis , most of the like to replace their iphone phones by the replacement of their own iphone .

according to the media , during production , taiwan suffered several earthquakes , &quot; the destruction of the production facilities was more than that of imagination and could have an impact on the early supply . &quot;
the contradiction between supply and demand affects the ordinary users , and it is time to choose a good channel , and the first one is the first one .
in the near future , senior su ning met with apple companies to prepare for adequate supplies , according to people familiar with the matter .
the operator has already talked su ning , and it is foreseen that , with the deep cooperation of the two sides , it will inevitably bring lower prices and more intimate services to users .
&quot; at the lowest price , consumers may be buying $ number yuan a day to buy the iphone , &quot; he said ’ . &quot;
there are plenty of supplies and diverse offers to buy no longer &quot; stress &quot; , and su ning &apos; s logistics will make it a more intuitive sense of experience .
maybe , you &apos; ll get a call in the middle of the night . &quot; hello , su ning , your is here . &quot;

said the ability to improve oil refining equipment has also increased as domestic oil products quality standards continue to improve .
as a result , the quality of petroleum products exported by china is gradually reaching the same level as the world &apos; s highest quality of the world &quot; .
said , &quot; at the end of 2015 , china began to compete with japanese products in the asian market to export high quality products to australia .
while japan &apos; s high - oil oil is facing a crisis , japanese oil companies are taking the strategy to export the strategy only to &quot; focus on the market , which is at the same time as a region that has a profit margin &quot; .
thanks to the impact of china &apos; s exports of petroleum products on the asian market , it is becoming more and more important for the tea refinery .

on some nights , the ionosphere is full of free electrons , which means that radio signals can go farther .
the u . s . air force is interested in copying this effect , according to august 11 .
although a stable large number of free - electron ionization layers can help people listen to this radio station on the edge of a university radio station , this may not be the interest of the us air force .
the electrons filled with electrons mean that the military &apos; s use of radio has a larger range of transmission , and it may provide some protection for the global positioning system ( gps ) signals from solar storms .
the ultimate goal may be to create a series of cube satellites based on demand , which can strengthen the ionosphere when needed .
but first , these teams that contract the air force must prove that the scientific principle will work .
according to industry data , the total capacity of coal production capacity is nearly 6 billion tons , and the country &apos; s coal capacity is over 1.8 billion tons .
over the past decade , the state council has issued notices of the elimination of excess capacity and backward capacity after the state council .
although the former has not been aimed at the coal industry , the target industry is directly related to the coal industry .
last november - 5500 to january this year , qinhuangdao 370 coal prices have long been hovering at 90 % yuan / tons , and $ number per cent of coal companies are losing money .
since february , has recovered gradually , and the recent high prices have risen to a continuous rise , rising to a high of 436 yuan a month , up $ number yuan per tonne , up nearly $ number per cent from the beginning of the year .
as the price picks up , concerns about the emergence of a number of small coal mines will not be ？
in this case , china ( hainan ) reform and development of the institute of economics , the director kuang xianming the institute of economic development analysis and interpretation .
kuang xianming : going to capacity has attracted high attention from all parties , and the report on the production of capacity today in the coal industry is a bit of a concern .
these three surface factors reflect the reason why the past changes in the pattern of growth in the past have not been fundamentally transformed by the way the government - led growth approach has yet to be fundamentally transformed .
second , it is also directly related to the progress of local governments , where funds and corresponding measures will be in place in the process of capacity - making , from which the differences in different regions are indeed relatively large .
third , if the current slow - moving provinces are to be in progress in the second half of the year , they may face a bigger risk .
in such cases , the process of relying on the central prize fund to promote capacity - building may have a negative impact .
first , capacity is not simply a matter of total control .
our goal is to reconstruct the entire coal industry by eliminating backward production capacity , advancing structural optimization , and reconstructing the entire coal industry .
in the process of deployment , the local government must combine the transition from capacity to coal industry to the transformation of the coal industry , and vigorously develop the related services industry .
second , we should give full play to the power of administrative supervision and administrative oversight if we are to complete the task force this year in the year .
finally , we need to strengthen the role of social security .
because the market is directly involved in the issue of employment , we need to strengthen the training of employment skills for staff and workers .

ning zetao &apos; s performance in the 100 m freestyle semi - finals has left many chinese audiences speechless .
can be in the meter freestyle preliminary , ning zetao once again refresh people &apos; s &quot; bottom line &quot; .
in fact , the freestyle is not , his performance and best grades in the tournament , and he has decided that he is unlikely to make a breakthrough in the project .
as a result , hong kong &apos; s authoritative media , , said the biggest reason ning zetao the loss was that he had lost interest in swimming .
many of the factors outside the court may have a great impact on his thoughts on the future , and he is now more interested in entering the entertainment circle .
, after the world championships , ning zetao his high - face value and good results , instantly became the net red .
so , &quot; national husband &quot; , &quot; little meat &quot; , &quot; figure &quot; and other names are also constantly becoming the label of him .
various commercial activities to find the door , beautiful money , become a bright avenue .
in this case , ning zetao is not only his freedom , but also a path that seems feasible , even if he chooses to retire at the moment .
after all , he was only $ number years old and he would be able to play a part in a couple of tv plays with a certain degree of learning .
but needs to see if he has enough qualifications to compare with those of his predecessors ？
2000 $ time the sydney olympic games , $ number years old liu xuan has come to the end of an athlete &apos; s career .
liu xuan &apos; s beautiful appearance made her quickly remembered , and laid the foundation for her future in the entertainment industry .
after his retirement liu xuan starred in a variety of tv plays , and set up his own studio on 2013 .
tian liang took part in the single double race of the two olympic games and won the gold silver silver .
however , after losing to his team - mate hu jia the race of the 2004 olympic games tian liang &apos; s competitive state fell and was expelled from the diving team .
and his daughter and his daughter go to &quot; where to go &quot; and other variety shows , even more let him earn the eye .
once the gymnastics golden generation yang wei li xiaopeng and chen yibing are all high - profile to participate in various variety shows .
it is worth mentioning that li xiaopeng led china to the champion of the 2008 olympic games , yang wei was more than twice taken to the individual all - round gold medal , known as .
and chen yibing , who led china to the 2012 olympic group champion , was also the king .
and in the london olympic games in the case of the gold medal of the gold medal , chen yibing is generous of the action , also let him circle a lot of powder .
but these athletes are still focused on the stadium , and it &apos; s just like on the variety show - - just to go .
but whether it &apos; s retired or active , the popularity of the entertainment industry needs to be guaranteed .
after all , athletes step into a new field , whether it is ability or network , is a blank state .
even tian liang , liu xuan , such as the entertainment circle of &quot; old people &quot; , the average audience to mention them , more or more think of their performance in the olympic games .
yang wei , li xiaopeng , and other new recruits in the variety show when the introduction , no exception is the &quot; olympic champion &quot; .
compared with the above several people , ning zetao a swimming world championships champion is slightly thin .
moreover , the negative effects of ning zetao tian liang , liu xuan , yang wei , in the age of , , and , are likely to be incalculable .
after all , to bring up the athletes , the people &apos; s requirements are &quot; not to ask for the , but to be afraid of the danger , ning zetao distance is a little worse .
step 10 thousand says , the ning zetao is handsome , and can depend on the face of yan to get the support of thousands of powder .
no skill , just depend on the appearance , want to be mixed in the entertainment circle , this difficulty is not more difficult than a good training back .
the choice of the path of life is based on individual wishes , but it is important to know ning zetao to choose .
on the surface , the network social platform expands the communication circle , reducing the sense of loneliness .
the more extensive the network social influence , not only gradually replace the traditional telephone contact , even penetrate into the real life circle , quietly change the people &apos; s social life .

&quot; social networks have the characteristics of low cost , fast transmission , and so on , and meet the needs of contemporary college students . &quot;
expanding interpersonal relationships , a more egalitarian dialogue , and avoiding social concerns are the main reasons for talking more about the line .
the new people in the company love to communicate with their colleagues , &quot; because they are not too familiar , and the relationship is much closer than before , through the of social platforms &quot; .
&quot; there is always a time before and after a friend because there was some misunderstanding , but later in a large group of conversations . &quot;
it engineer wu yan is a depth network of social lovers , most of his social life is on the line , the network contacts more than the number of friends around the line .
wu yan himself also admitted to the internet a more &quot; fish in water &quot; .
&quot; you can respond to your friends at your own time , because there is a lot of time to say , and you can make it clearer . &quot;
&quot; hidden under the id is that you come to avoid face - to - face contacts , not only room for maneuver , even more time and space for each other . &quot;
&quot; people with different identities have the right and the efficiency of the same statement , and in real life , there seems to be all the elimination of cyberspace in cyberspace . &quot;
however wu yan &apos; s friend peng felt that life was wu yan a &quot; very boring &quot; .
peng and wu yan met in a large group because they were both active speakers and soon became .
peng $ number ) if you have a chance to make a difference , you may not be able to make a difference . if you don &apos; t have wu yan chance to make a difference , if you want to go to the internet , you will be able to find out if you want to go to the internet &quot; .

japan &apos; s prime minister shinzo abe will attend the sixth african development conference in kenya , according to the news summit of china .
the african development conference was dominated by japan , which was held in tokyo or yokohama , japan , and the conference would also be the first time in africa .
foreign ministry officials in japan say that a local meeting in africa would help to attract attention from japan and the european countries .
in order to match the visit of shinzo abe , the ldp will send parliamentarians to the countries concerned .
it is not a coincidence that japan &apos; s &quot; &quot; road begins at the beginning of the last century , when japan launched its african development conference at the beginning of 1990s ！
africa , with its seat in the united nations , is an important ticket to the united nations , and how can japan abandon africa ？
exchanges of views on the &quot; islamic state &quot; and terrorist activities of the states would also be exchanged with states concerned .
the &quot; western group &quot; will visit countries such as sierra leone , liberia , guinea - bissau and so on .
japanese foreign minister recently made a statement on the african development conference in the united nations security council .
abe has said in this announcement that , for the sake of stability in sub - saharan africa , 100 billion yen ( rmb 6.1 billion ) will be provided in .
observers generally believe that japan &apos; s generosity to africa has always been two aims : one is to increase japan &apos; s presence in africa ; and to try to win support from african countries on common issues .
according to yang bojiang , a japanese expert , japan has always regarded it as the so-called &quot; big ticket field , &quot; although the number of countries is relatively underdeveloped , but the number of countries is relatively high ’ . &quot;
japan will not give up in the future , and the work of africa will not be terminated in this regard and will continue to be strengthened .
economically , because japan &apos; s productivity is relatively strong , but the domestic market is relatively limited , especially in the context of the aging background , domestic demand is relatively relatively low .
however , from junichiro koizumi , a year ago , to abe , a year after &apos; s , japan has launched many of its , but not all of them .
japanese expert yang bojiang believes that japanese access to the usual intentions is clear , but the way to the common road is bound to be difficult .
japan needs to do well with its neighbors in order to achieve its goals , and japan needs to have a right attitude in terms of geopolitical rivalry or ethnic disputes and historical awareness .

many nba players prove their strength . but there is a decline in people &apos; s progress .
whether the age of age or the appearance of the time limit , each season a number of players will appear to be on the back of a setback .
of course , some &quot; &quot; may simply be the shrink of data , which may not have fallen .
even if wade is still one of the best scoring defenders in the league , his performance in the bull should not be as good as the heat .
he and were limited in range , and the three - point hit of star butler was only 32.8 % , which allowed them to play very crowded next season .
when it comes to , is bound to give the ball more to butler and , who will probably be able to choose a healthy regimen in the regular season .
&apos;s situation is more embarrassing , as the first choice of season in the last season , and he had to compete with simmons and in the new season in the new season .
the competition may not be fast enough for to adapt to the nba stadium , but also needs to be fully recovered from the injury as soon as possible , but whether can be a problem in &apos; s .
in the last season , &apos; s score came from a low offensive , higher than , and brooke lopez , while his use rate was also high .
with simmons already showing his excellent target for the ball striker , also has a more fit for the nba race , and &apos; s position may be harder to make .
in the past two seasons , thompson &apos; s use rate has stabilized in front of the alliance , which was the best two of his career .
the question is , however , that thompson &apos; s use of thompson is bound to fall in the presence of , which is bound to affect his performance .
the impact will not only be the impact of the number of moves , but the &apos; s attack will definitely decrease in the next season , which will also reduce the difficulty of the opponent &apos; s defense against him .
the arrival of will certainly reduce the numbers of the players , but the most serious one may be thompson .
but that doesn &apos; t mean it &apos; s a bit of a setback for , which is more like the sacrifice he has made for the team .
parker &apos; s performance over the last season was better than that of the data , not only because he was at the top of his career , but the chemistry of and benefited the spurs .
duncan retired , declared a year of war , and the combination of gdp ended up at the end , as the youngest of three , and there was little oil in the oil tank of the french sports car .
after getting the third championship ring , only , jordan and russell have won more regular than james , and jordan is the only one who has more than james .
oh , yeah , james just brought to cleveland for the first professional sports championship trophy in the past year .
james , who has been in his career for 14th seasons , needs a better guarantee of physical strength to prepare for the playoffs .
so , in the conventional game , james &apos; s data are likely to fall further , and he will give more of the burden to owen , but he will still easily become the top three in the league .

the united kingdom won a silver medal in the football game , and fiji won the gold medal
the british team failed to continue its excellent performance in the football match on thursday night in the presence of the fiji team , which was defeated by fiji &apos; s stadium in .
the fiji team won the first olympic medal in the country &apos; s first olympic medal , with its , , , , and power , and it was the first olympic medal in the country &apos; s history .
silver was a little consolation to the defeated british team , which won the third silver medal in the day of the british delegation &apos; s first entry into the olympic games .
earlier that day , british teams played south africa with than , which could affect their status in the final .
but at any rate , now fiji is enough to beat a full - fledged team .
tomorrow , at least one british man will wear a gold medal , which may be a comfort to the british team , but probably not , as ben , an englishman from , who served as the coach of the british team .
it is not easy for the british team to achieve today &apos; s achievements .
eight years ago , in the direction of ryan ryan , they did it at the international football game .
now , they are only a step away from the champion .
although they have received a tremendous blow , they have made remarkable progress .
the opening of fiji &apos; s opening was an advantage to keep the british team out of control .
for tom mitchell and his team - mates , it was like a series of running buses . when broke into , the world &apos; s series of champions had been leading the way .
after only four minutes of the race , jerry scored again on the right wing .
was better than , and the british team had hardly touched the ball .
mitchell &apos; s power the giant lyon , who has not scored a third goal , but this is just a delay in the speed of the score .
in minutes , touched the ground at the right angle . was worse .
that &apos; s a point . . . the game . . . the first half of the game was left for a minute .
then , broke through the british team &apos; s defense and went straight to the scoring line .
in the middle of the interval , the score was more .
the are like the birth of a , and the british team is still .
that &apos; s the way it is .
the british team made great changes in the second half and hit the defense in four minutes , and in the first half , the performance was good .
dan norton has created a chance of scoring for the british team , who hit the ground in the left corner and changed the score to , but the competition was already on the platform of the south china sea island , with their fans singing , waving flags and singing and dancing .
the remarkable performance of the fiji team had to be .
at the last minute , william stopped the fiji attack against a attack .
the final whistle sounded and the embraced , and &apos; s british team could only regret the exit .
earlier that day , fiji beat the japanese team in the semi - final in the semi - final , but britain was in the battle against south africa in a fierce semi - final match .
kyle brown helped south africa to help south africa in the first half , but dan norton scored well in the second half .
then , , the brother of the england team , secured the team &apos; s victory with an excellent intercept , and the british team won the silver medal .
helen and heather were inspired by cancer coaching and won a gold medal in rowing
it is no exaggeration to say that this is the most touching of a gold medal .
from the first paddle to the present , helen and heather have accepted 220 punitive exercises , and they have a more extraordinary meaning for the gold medal in .
while the oars were only the two of them , there was a man in the boat - coach robin williams - the voice of the two women in the second round of the women &apos; s double .
they have maintained the record of a record , with absolute superiority .
what we are seeing is that the two talented athletes are walking gracefully on the water , but not all of this victory .
there is a lot of volunteer help behind every rowing gold medal , it is their constant dedication that has created a difference , and the most helpful is the coach who learned that he had cancer before a month ago and didn &apos; t know whether he could live to see the day .
as he said , death is likely to come at any time .
i had bladder cancer , and they did surgery for me .
if no surgery is done , the cancer cells will spread throughout the body .
in this way , the situation will be much worse .
this will change your opinion slightly .
williams was diagnosed as cancer on december 2013 .
fortunately , he began his treatment at the beginning of 2014 , although it may not be appropriate to say that in such cases .
i need to get a salary , so i have to hurry up .
this is an incentive for me .
i live in the hospital , although they say a few steps will be enough , but i walk around the ward every time , 30 feet , 50 feet .
this is the beginning of everything .
the rowing movement itself is a journey , which makes it a bit longer .
at the moment of the gold medal , the first thing they thought of was williams , who was slightly more talkative this morning than usual , to overcome his anxiety .
&quot; i &apos; m in a bad mood this week and it might be a bit extreme , &quot; she said . &quot; i &apos; m a bit of a , but the gold medal is amazing . &quot;
it repeatedly told me how important it was to me , and how much effort i took with helen and robin .
it was the return of helen , robin and me for three years .
if there &apos; s no robin , we &apos; re just a , thank you very much . he &apos; s the best coach in the world .
i can &apos; t find a better trainer and coach than he is .
helen and heather were for five years .
this combination of penalties for the combination is not comparable to their rivals .
even at the end of the last 500 meters , new zealand and denmark began approaching , with a great deal of physical fitness .
it was really exciting .
helen &apos; s name is : &quot; keep your pace and keep your pace &quot; .
not being influenced by your opponent is really important .
we have a very good start , and we don &apos; t look forward to what to do .
we didn &apos; t think about the glory of today , we just want to make every oar and win the game , and we did it .
it took a year to determine the future of its own future .
will marry steve , a television explorer , next month .
but now , she just wants to enjoy the moment .
i don &apos; t want to say it &apos; s my last game .
this will give me too much pressure .
in london , i took about six months to realize that i was the olympic champion .
it was a completely new experience , and i felt very nervous .
it is now about $ number minutes .
&quot; i feel much better , &quot; she said . &quot;

&apos;s &quot; cartoon &quot; effect was pointed to the irony of asians
says the inspiration for this filter comes from animation , but some observers think it has a racial color .
&apos;s 0.15 billion daily users can change the reality through their filter tools and turn people funny and funny .
you can turn yourself into a pineapple , a dog , or a character in roy .
these lenses have the effect of passivation and bending characteristic , and produce more than 30 million each day .
any mistake will immediately be noticed by the public .
the lens has been criticized for the use of a negro or a white skin .
so when it comes to some users this week for some users to create a filter that can create , , and , some critics call it the &quot; &quot; of asia &apos; s .
they even think that the recurring problems mean that the company has a bigger problem in its diversity .
after the indicated its deletion of the function , the report of the and on wednesday caused .
the company explains that the filter is a tribute to the cartoon character , not the irony of asians .
but for the observers who experienced racism , the filter reminded them of the stereotypes of reality .
others are also determined to oppose the cartoon image .
a chinese - american artist , who was widely shared and widely shared , said in an email that these filters were &quot; at least uncomfortable and uncomfortable &quot; .
she also said : &quot; it is difficult to distinguish between the extremely disgusting asian satire image and the filter effect . &quot;
although the filter is not only the , but the people are extremely .
is not the only company that touches the bottom line .
from the company &apos; s board to hollywood and the equipment we carry , american culture seems to have been promoting diversity and inclusiveness .
&apos;s large young group , which is more focused on race than the older generation , is likely to be very sensitive .
when &apos; s filter created an image of insulting the user , zhu kaidi , $ number , said in an interview on thursday : &quot; this kind of thing is harder than before . &quot;
on thursday , ms. zhu , the product manager and engineer in , decided to delete her account and encourage others to do so .
in an article written in and in a telephone interview , she expressed her view that ethnic diversity reflected the lack of racial diversity during the recruitment process .
ms. zhu criticized the company for most of its employees , with the leadership full of men and a label at the end of the article .
&quot; either they don &apos; t have a variety of people in their employees , so they can make this decision or they have some colored people in their employees , but their jobs don &apos; t allow them to talk , &quot; said zhu . &quot;
other observers shared her complaint that she had not been answered .
the company did not publish data on the diversity of staff , and said it was a private company .
on thursday , declined to discuss its employee &apos; s racial background , but a spokesman said the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on lower - level groups and promote internal inclusion .
ms. zhu said she would close her account : &quot; i wonder if they need more people like us to oppose it . &quot;
congressional groups say military officials distort the intelligence of isis
in a report released thursday , a congressional panel pointed out that officials from the us central command have changed their intelligence reports that the war situation in iraq and syria will be more optimistic than the actual situation .
the interim report comes from a special working group organized by the house military commission , intelligence commission and representatives of the national defense committee of the house of representatives of the house of representatives , which reports that there is &quot; widespread dissatisfaction &quot; among the cia intelligence analysts , who say the superiors are altering their assessment of the war between the united states and the islamic state .
the central command in tampa , florida , is a military headquarters to oversee the united states military operations in the middle east and central asia .
according to a report on the report , &quot; the intelligence described by the senior leadership of the central command to the united states counter - terrorism action is more optimistic than the actual situation and has always been more optimistic than the analysis of other intelligence agencies . &quot;
the republican representative in california said : &quot; the central command &apos; s behavior is difficult to accept . the other side is that senior policy makers have received the wrong analysis . &quot;
the leadership of the central command has extended to the top of the agency .
the report has been detailed in the description and analysis of the long - standing issue of the united states training of iraqi forces in the united states and the analysis of the central command .
while there is no certainty that senior officials of the obama administration have ordered the changes to be changed , the analysts feel they have been stressed by the leaders of the central command to make a more optimistic view of the threat of the islamic state ( isis or .
&quot; in the first half of 2015 , many central headquarters press releases , statements and congressional testimony were much more optimistic than the actual situation , &quot; the report said . &quot;
a central command official , for example , publicly said it might be the first to take a large military action against mosul at a large military action on april 2015 or may .
the country &apos; s second - largest city , mosul , is still under the control of the islamic state .
&quot; after months of investigation , the results have been quite obvious , &quot; says , a kansas state republican representative in a statement . &quot;
from 2014 to 2015 , most high - level intelligence officials in the us central command have manipulated the intelligence products of the headquarters and concealed threats from the islamic state of iraq .
when the republicans learned from the analyst that the information about the islamic state was manipulated , a special working group was set up .
as the investigation continues , more discoveries will be made following the report released thursday .
the attorney general of the department of defense also conducted a long-term survey of the central command .
the democratic members of the house of representatives of the house of representatives released their findings on thursday , consistent with some of the republican special working group &apos; s conclusions .
in a statement , the democratic party leader , xie anda , said in a statement that the central command &apos; s intelligence assessment of the islamic state and iraq &apos; s peacekeeping forces had developed an overly narrow process during the period 2014 to 2015 . &quot;
xie anda said the process &quot; hindered the release of information &quot; , lowered the analyst &apos; s morale and &quot; cannot accept different opinions . &quot;
but xie anda and the democrats said they did not find any evidence that the white house tried to put pressure on the central command &apos; s analysts , and that their conclusions were in line with &quot; default or political narrative . &quot;
the wild animal daily reported the preliminary results of the congressional investigation on tuesday .
last august , the new york times reported that after receiving a complaint from the analyst of the central command , the chief prosecutor of the pentagon began its investigation .
a pentagon spokesman , admiral patrick evans , said in a statement that the defense department could not comment on the congressional report before the general prosecutor &apos; s survey was completed .
but he said , &quot; experts are sometimes divided by the interpretation of complex data , and intelligence agencies and the department of defense are encouraging a healthy dialogue on these important national security themes . &quot;
the impact of the survey has exceeded the question of whether the us - led bombing operations in iraq and syria were made ( more and more defense officials have claimed ) to succeed .
but last year , these arguments raised the public about how president obama could trust the military operations of iraq , afghanistan , libya , and other crisis areas released by the central command .
the criticism of the islamic state is reminiscent of the controversy over a decade ago , when the central command , hooker , wrote a research article that pointed out that george w . bush &apos; s government , in spite of the opposition of many analysts , insisted that small - scale troops be sent to iraq and not to consider the situation in the aftermath of the 2003 .
hu ke hook played a key role in the opposition &apos; s opposition to the intelligence of the islamic state .
last year , officials said that hu ke hook &apos; s team concluded that air strikes against the islamic state refinery had not significantly reduced the economic revenues of terrorist organizations , as the terrorist organization built a temporary oil refinery to continue to sell oil on the black market , which is quite different from that published .
according to the report of the times , the central command did not disclose this discovery to the public .
the central command chief commander lloyd austin was criticized last year as a senate testimony to the senate &apos; s testimony to an over - optimistic assessment of the war .
general austin , retired from general , is currently being replaced by joseph in the central command office .

both teams are going to the finals , which will determine who will appear as the first person of the group .

the poor meal of the great feast of the great feast
march 1933 , new president franklin roosevelt was elected president of the president &apos; s office for lunch .
as a gourmet , president roosevelt likes fifth avenue , such as and maryland &apos; s stew .
on that day , his menu was simple : tomato sauce , mashed potatoes and pudding .
jean said : &quot; this is to share the joys and sorrows of people with the suffering people . &quot;
her husband , andrew , added : &quot; this also reflects the american diet . &quot;
the couple who live in the brooklyn highlands are historians of food history .
mr. &apos; s last book , &quot; fried , &quot; is about american chinese food , and ms. tells the life story of the slum tenants in her book of &quot; orchard &quot; in her book .
the new book , a big meal , will be published by harper press on tuesday , which describes the history of food history in the united states during the great depression .
they met a reporter in &apos; s sandwich shop after showing some food . the simple lunch counter in the iron area has been open since 1929 .
ms. , $ number , ordered a cream cheese with a cheese sandwich , while mr. , $ number , ordered a turkey , mashed potato and vegetable .
the reporter ordered a , and the couple thought the dishes were suitable for talking about the great depression .
&quot; it was very popular then , &quot; ms. said . &quot;
then there was peanut bread , liver bread , and soy bread .
they are made of a raw material and a kind of cheap that can be placed on the raw material .
just imagine that your dinner is peanuts .
mr. colin played .
&quot; they &apos; re definitely like lead in your stomach , &quot; he said . &quot;
in the years before the great depression , american were buffet , especially in the suburbs .
a group of women cook for the men &apos; s farm workers , breakfast , lunch and dinner all have freshly made pies .
during the first world war , americans were giving food to the hungry europeans , who recorded how the country suddenly ceased to be a place of prosperity .
mr explains why he and his wife wrote the book : &quot; at the time , food had become a major topic for americans . &quot;
another unpleasant topic is the shabby new food : bread and stew , such as bread and stew , became the main dish , and said it was because chefs could use the cream of the sauce to cover the bad food .
fresh fruit is replaced by cheap dried fruits .
the meat has become a rare luxury in the american dining table for many years .
a strange mixture of calories , more than taste , or even basic cooking sense , is the first to consider nutrition .
in the study of the book , including various recipes , ms. made a roast onion stuffed with peanut oil .
&quot; it &apos; s not common on the dinner table , &quot; says mr . &quot;
ms said : &quot; this is too strange &quot; .
peanut oil and baked onions can &apos; t be matched at all .
this is the characteristic of many family economic meals .
family economists affect the diet of the country , including louis stanley , the head of the federal household economy , 1943 - 1923 , and is unique in history .
they have published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines to encourage women to &quot; &quot; and to make delicious foods such as carrots and carrots as good food .
&quot; the great meal &quot; is a rich &quot; history of the taste of history &quot; .
in particular , the government &apos; s response to the hungry people , such as president herbert hoover &apos; s &quot; other people &apos; s things , i can &apos; t handle .
although he publicly praised the simple iowa farmhouse in his childhood , his diet was like a millionaire .
&quot; he likes to eat european - style western food , like fish with cucumber sauce , &quot; mr said &quot; .
he was dressed in an evening dress and ate in a gold - plated restaurant .
he was clearly out of the way of the people .
if not his wife eleanor encouraged him to set an example in his diet , president roosevelt might have made the same mistake .
as the book says , ms. roosevelt &apos; s housekeeper was not interested in taste , so the white house &quot; food was not only the worst food in washington , but also the worst food . &quot;
when the united states returned to normal , many of the great depression years of cooking were abandoned .
ms. said the left was our focus on calories and nutrition and the use of science in cooking .
the couple said they had further learned about ms. &apos; s mother &apos; s diet , such as how she did not discard food , while writing the book .
&quot; she was very afraid of wasting food , &quot; mr. said . &quot;
ms. recalled : &quot; she actually makes a lot of people sick . &quot;
for example , there had been a &quot; cream &quot; event .
after the plate was removed , she and mr. took out a dessert at home : that &apos; s what president roosevelt had for lunch .
&quot; this is called butter - cream , &quot; said ms. . &quot; and add that a common name for a common dish is a &quot; usual trick &quot; .
there is no cream in this dessert , only , a little flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone the spoon into the thick brown paste of the thick brown paste .
surprisingly , the dessert has a good taste .
mr. ate the second spoon and the third spoon .
he thought it was an acceptable dessert , and he told his wife that it would be more delicious to add to it . &quot;
unfortunately , opec &apos; s latest monthly report shows that the production of crude oil continues to rise , and saudi yields hit a new high .
the report makes the market suspicious of opec &apos; s credibility , and the road to recovery remains fraught with thorns .
this week , opec chairman and qatar energy minister said opec would hold informal meetings during the international energy forum .
the weekly monthly output of opec , including gabon , rose 46 thousand barrels / days to 33.11 million barrels a day , according to the monthly report released by opec on wednesday .
opec also said in its monthly report that low - price oil prices have prompted global refiners to produce more refined oil products , thereby aggravating the level of market supply .
it was affected by the news , coupled with an increase in the us demand for crude oil and an increase in crude oil inventories , and international oil prices fell for two consecutive days .
as of wednesday , light crude oil futures fell 2.48 % per cent on the new york mercantile exchange , and crude oil futures fell 2.07 % per cent in london on october % .
according to reuters , the proposed oil - producing conference is unlikely to tighten the supply , and the data released by the united states energy information agency also depress market sentiment .
iran &apos; s oil minister , , quoted iran &apos; s oil minister wednesday as saying iran &apos; s daily oil production was 3.85 million barrels a day , the highest since 2008 .
as soon as the news of the meeting was held , russian energy minister said there was no need for a new round of freeze - production negotiations under the current price of oil .
the last time the oil producer held the meeting was april , and the opec member states failed to agree on any measures .
richards richards , &apos; s oil and gas analyst , said the market and the media might be overly responsive to opec &apos; s meeting .
, head of commodity strategy at royal bank of canada , said opec would change the market &apos; s mood by releasing the signal that they would bring about .
it was like the smoke and mirror that led a man out of sight ） .
, head of commodity research at the german commercial bank , said it was said that opec attempts to stabilize the market by september .
this is likely to further undermine the confidence of the market over opec , after all , after all , the organization has staged a &quot; wolf &quot; .

scottish cyclist skinner skinner helped the british team in rio last night to help the british three groups after the successful defending of the olympic gold medals after the olympic games in london .
the replaced his scottish fellow fellow of scotland , sir chris , as the backbone of the team , and the legendary cyclist was proud of him as young skinner beat him to the top new zealand team .
four years ago , british team , and won the fifth of the six olympic gold medals .
the british team ranked sixth in the world cycling championships in london , , and then the british team created a great success .
during the beijing olympics to the olympic games in london , the british team &apos; s problem was to replace the &quot; expert of the first circle &quot; jamie .
the convoy was only doing so when hindley appeared .
&apos;s retirement left a blank , and and matt wanted to fill the gap .
after seeing the potential of skinner , the british coach insisted that he would be elected to the national team , and skinner finally came to the end .
skinner &apos; s partner was and kenny , who won gold medals four years huo yi ago , in the first round of the new zealand team .
the three british cycling races finally beat their opponents and won the gold medal .
while hindley was a bit behind , kenny was leading the team , and skinner kept the lead in the end .
the change in the strategy is the key to this reversal , and hindley has chosen the larger flywheel , so the speed is slow , and that allows kenny , especially mr. skinner to keep pace .
huo yi watched the game as a bbc commentator . skinner , kenny and hindley saw him when he was on the podium .
&quot; it makes me flattered , &quot; said glasgow bike hand skinner , aged $ number . &quot;
i &apos; m just doing what i can to make myself .
we made the olympic record in the final and beat the world champion .
this is incredible .
nothing is better than this victory .
when he won a gold medal with kenny and in the early london games , hindley admitted that he had deliberately fallen on the track when he had a bad start .
later , he withdrew his comments , and british rivals could not appeal .
there is no such thing as victory .
&quot; it &apos; s like in london , and the british flag is on the platform , &quot; hindley said . &quot;
we just had a team three months ago .
we have already lost many of the world champions , so it &apos; s surprising that they have been able to defend the olympic champion .
this is only a game and a gold medal for the british team that won the gold medal in the olympic games in beijing and the london games .
if this symbolizes progress in the past five months , we will continue to be successful in the in the next five days .
according to the state of kenny , he is not unlikely to be able to reproduce &apos; s feat of winning three gold medals at an olympic games .
if so , it seems to be a holy day for british sport , steve , and roger , who were born on the day of the birth .
the result was flat with huo yi .
kenny will come down to the beginning today and the three - day race .
&quot; i will focus on this game for a while , &quot; said .
the team game is always the best .
you can win the game with your teammates .
to be frank , one person wins a little lonely .
hindley said : &quot; if he could win two other gold medals , then he would have been awarded jazz . &quot;
it was the only game of the day , but the british team received other good news .
sir bradley , ed , steven burke and owen are on the fastest track to get to the four - group chase .
their achievement is 351.943 .
the world record for the gold medal winners of the 2012 olympic games in london was 351.659 .
the first round and the final ( ) will be held on the second day of the game , and will undoubtedly be the focus of attention .
he was in a dispute with the competition officer yesterday , when the competition officials asked him to measure the height of his height .
in the women &apos; s team that will end tomorrow , laura , joanna , eleanor buck and kate from are in the new world record 413.260 .
the british team relied on a powerful team of bicycle teams to take the initiative in the mid - term and have won more than one medal .
after showing his absolute dominance in the beijing and london games , the british bicycle team made a bit of a disappointment in the course of the trip to rio .
during the period , many of the ups and downs occurred , including the resignation of sean , director of technical director sean , for sex discrimination and bullying , and the retirement of legendary characters like , victoria .
but the bike &apos; s first night night is enough to prove that the british team will play a key role in the peak state of legend .

the head of the national development and development reform commission said today that the excess steel capacity is a global problem .
in recent years , the capacity utilization rate in china is higher than that of the global average , and is higher than that of the united states and the united states and other countries and regions .
our country has taken determined and effective measures to defuse the excess capacity , and the effectiveness is gradually appearing .
the head of the state council attaches great importance to the global issue of excess steel capacity .
all departments and regions actively implement the deployment of the state council and carry out work seriously this year , with 45 million tons of crude steel capacity of this year .
from the national conditions of our country , china does not encourage the export of steel exports , but also takes a series of practical measures to control the export of steel .
the director stressed that international trade in iron and steel is essentially market - oriented and is an independent choice based on the demand of importing countries and consumers in comprehensive consideration of product price ratio .
the implementation of trade protection measures will not help fundamentally solve the problem of development in the global steel industry , but , on the contrary , will only have a further impact on international trade order .
when it comes to debt , the head of responsibility emphasizes that resolving the debt problem is an important issue that needs to be properly dealt with in the process of eliminating excess capacity .
due to the large size of the steel enterprise &apos; s assets , the debt relationship of some enterprises is complicated , and if the disposal is improper , it may cause regional risk .
according to the director , in recent years , as the economic downward pressure increases , the social aggregate demand gradually weakened , some industry capacity utilization rate fell , enterprises production and business difficulties increased .
some enterprises do not adapt to the changing of market environment , production and operation are not to be adjusted to the near future , but they are restricted by some institutional mechanisms , so as to get out of the market and become &quot; zombie enterprises &quot; .
the existence of such enterprises distorted market signals , reduced the efficiency of resource utilization and increased the cost of social management , hampering the establishment of a fair competition market environment .
the main cause of losses is the same as the difficulties faced by the global steel industry - the market demand is weak and the capacity - utilization rate is low .
our country mainly adopts the market mechanism , the economic means and the rule of law , the government is mainly to do the work of the staff and workers and the social stability work to ensure a fair and fair market order .
the leader stressed that the next step would be to continue to catch up with capacity work , to ensure the goal of completing 0.1 billion - 0.15 billion tons of crude steel capacity in $ number .

the future of the portland smelting plant is fraught with uncertainty by the cancellation of power supply contracts
as the power company power to supply power companies revealed that a factory owner would end a supply contract , so that all supply contracts failed , and hundreds of workers in portland , victoria , and factory hundreds of workers are currently facing an uncertain future .
the move took place in the victorian government &apos; s decision not to continue issuing subsidies to ensure factory operations .
the six - year - old fixed subsidy will be terminated on november .
the 2000 workers in portland &apos; s portland factory are likely to face unemployment .
once the factory closes , there may be as many as 2000 people directly or indirectly unemployed .
and since the plant &apos; s electricity consumption accounts for about 10 % of the total power output of victoria , it may also have a chain reaction .
2014 closed the smelting plant in , which led to the closure of the power plant last year .
, the portland refinery , is currently in the process of losing and facing the risk of shutting down .
the move was made after a forecast of the factory &apos; s coming years , initially because the australian dollar was strong , and recently because of the price of the factory &apos; s products .
has been able to supply electricity to the large aluminum refinery by the old power plant in valley , and the company predicts that all of the other three plant owners will also terminate their agreements .
the biggest shareholder of the factory is a joint venture between company and alumina company , and china &apos; s citic group and japan &apos; s also hold a small stake .
&quot; expects that the portland factory will continue to operate , that is to say that the refinery will continue to produce electricity demand , &quot; the joint venture said . &quot;
mr said the contracts were a &quot; hedge - contract &quot; that would have been in effect since november 2016 &quot; .
the termination period of the contract is 2017 months , so they will be terminated on $ date .
&quot; as a result , still predicts that these contracts will continue to generate revenue in the fiscal year 2017 , &quot; the power company said . &quot;
any revenue impact that has been possible since the fiscal year 2018 will now be optimistic in the futures market for wholesale electricity prices .
mr said the company had reduced the value of $ 0.187 billion in the termination event expectations .
said the decision to terminate the contracts &quot; would not affect the ability of to operate the smelting plant or to ensure the power supply of the smelting plant &quot; .
the u . s . company said it had signed a contract for a three - year contract on 2010 and old , which would have been in force on november this year , but the company did not explain why it was withdrawn .
analysts were wary of the closure of the portland refinery in victoria and whether the plant near newcastle would be closed to the industry &apos; s bad economic situation .
according to the comments made earlier this week by analysts , , director of , says portland &apos; s electricity has reached about 600 per year , with the factory reaching about 900 .
if the two factories closed , the demand for electricity in the electricity market would be considerably reduced .
&quot; as a power company , this is not good news for us , &quot; he said &quot; .
community law centres will be closed every year by 0.16 million people
more than 0.16 million of the most vulnerable groups are shut out of the community law center each year , which is already in short supply , and is now facing further financial cuts .
in queensland , three of each of the five individuals were denied access to free legal advice and agency services while most of them were victims of elderly people , migrants , disadvantaged workers , victims of violence and the absence of resources against the victims of unjust expulsion .
the lack of funds for the legal services of the community has exceeded the limits of the limits and is now facing further financial cuts .
from next june , the federal government &apos; s funding for these legal centres will be reduced by 30 % per cent % .
james , director of the queensland community law center , said thousands of people were shut down every year , according to the latest national community association law center survey .
mr says that if the federal government does not change its existing decisions , the situation will only become worse .
&quot; queensland &apos; s community law center has long been short of funding , which means thousands of people will be unable to get the important services they need , &quot; he said . &quot;
those who need to stay away from the violence , those who are unable to repay the debt , the battered family and the crushed workers face legal questions and the report shows that they are unable to get the help they need .
the federal government will cut its funding by june 2017 per cent since 30 % , meaning that thousands of vulnerable groups in queensland will be forced to face complex legal issues without help .
we call upon minister of justice and queensland member george to immediately withdraw these cuts in funding and allow people to get the help they need in the face of legal issues .
last year , the state promised to raise legal aid to the national average .
it is time to focus on community law centres and their community needs , bai leqi the government must be involved in this important work .

britain must pass the olympic spirit and expand the airport at heathrow
heathrow will also bring vitality and prosperity to our communities , london , and the country as a whole .
for me , this is the charm of heathrow , as we do our best to ensure that our country and region are able to benefit from these events .
the olympics have benefited and .
and we will create opportunities for the region to benefit from local people and businesses that are nearby .
as far as our local community is concerned , we will create 10,000 new apprentices , 40,000 new jobs , and leave the youth around the airport out of unemployment .
as some people believed before the 2012 olympic games in london , the expansion of heathrow was too large .
i am told that britain will not be ready for the games and we will be humiliated in the face of the world .
skeptics are wrong about 2012 , and their suspicions about heathrow will also prove wrong .
although there will always be obstacles to the need to overcome , heath is solving every problem .
like the olympics , heathrow is the infrastructure project for most people , not for the minority .
the expansion will create up to 211 billion new jobs , bring about 0.18 million pounds of economic growth , leaving a technology and a wealth for the airport and the entire uk .
we have an excellent heathrow project team , which is on time and completed 11 billion pounds of infrastructure investment projects within the budget , including the terminal of the world &apos; s best airport terminal in five years and on the terminal of the world &apos; s busiest two runways .
now , they are preparing to build a third runway for private investment in ￡ 16 billion .
britain succeeded in hosting the 2012 olympic games , and i believe that the heathrow airport expansion project will also be a great success .
it is the time for us to pass the olympic spirit and expand heathrow &apos; s airport so that we will be able to escort and create a technology and employment wealth that will be proud of us .

nasa climate model : venus is a place for humans to live on
according to projections from nasa &apos; s new climate model , venus was once a place for human habitation .
scientists at nasa &apos; s space research institute have developed a model that can explore the past situation of venus in the past . the tools and algorithms used by the model are similar to that used by climate scientists .
the model is used to determine if surface temperatures , and the atmosphere of carbon dioxide are once similar to the earth &apos; s environment .
previously , scientists believed that the rotation was slower because of its thick atmosphere .
but the latest simulation shows that venus may have had a thinner atmosphere , similar to the earth &apos; s atmosphere , and at the same time as the rotation of the time .
the model also shows the early terrain of venus .
the dry area of venus may be more likely than the earth , but there was enough water and geography to breed life and prevent rapid evaporation .
in the early days , the sun &apos; s brightness on venus was 30 % higher than that of the earth % .
in a news conference , , the scientist at the space research institute , explained at the news conference : &quot; in the model of the space research , the slow rotation of venus makes the day in the first two months of the day . &quot;
this makes the surface warmer and produces rain that can form a thick cloud of rain , thick clouds , like an umbrella , blocking most of the sun &apos; s heat .
the result of the simulation is that the average climatic temperature of venus is actually a few degrees lower than that of the present earth .
the venus evolution simulated by the model is similar to previous planetary scientists .
although venus may have lived on the planet , in a few billion years , venus has been exposed to high temperatures and ultraviolet light .
the planet &apos; s oceans evaporate , and the steam is also burned down by ultraviolet light .
with the escape of hydrogen , only a thicker carbon dioxide atmosphere and deadly greenhouse gas effects form the formation of the venus we know today .
the researchers published a simulation of the new venus climate model in the journal of geophysical research .

measure the rotation speed of the star of the pleiades star cluster
the new mission of the space telescope has helped astronomers gather the most complete star rotation speed of the star cluster .
the new data are helping astronomers understand why the stars of the cluster have different rotation speed and the association of the rotation cycle with the planet .
&quot; we want to learn more about the relationship between stars and other stars by comparing our results with other clusters , &quot; said , a research scientist at the center for infrared treatment at , the california institute of technology . &quot;
the cluster is 445 light - years away from the earth .
many of the stars in the cluster were born about 0.125 billion years ago and have just reached adulthood .
they have reached the highest rate of rotation in their life .
at the maximum rotation speed , these mature stars shoot a large number of stars .
when these stars wind through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a brake on the stars .
as the age of the star increases , its rotation slows down .
measured the rotation speed of each star by tracking the timing of the recognizable star sunspot ( like the sun .
the latest rotation speed data set indicates that the larger star &apos; s rotation speed is slower than the smaller mass of the star .
compared the star to a dancer with a larger dancer spinning faster than a smaller dancer .
&quot; in the of the cluster , we found that the stars with slower rotation tend to have greater mass , and the fastest stars tend to be the lightest stars , &quot; mr said . &quot;
due to the close proximity of the cluster , it can be used as an ideal cosmic laboratory for the comparison of star mass and rotation speed .
&quot; the cylon cluster is the basis for the young and the two - way rotating theory model of the old star , &quot; said . &quot;
we still have much to understand about how the stars , when and why they slow down their rotation and &quot; put off their .
and her colleagues described their latest analysis of their rotation speed in three new papers , which will soon be published in the journal astronomy .
