junior doctor &apos;s strike : calls for new labour action
the solicitor &apos;s representative called on the union to approve its new labour action against the new contract dispute .
the british medical association primary committee will require all its members to support more labour operations since early september .
the primary medical committee indicated that the ministers did not address concerns about the contract .
junior doctors and medical students voted to boycott a contract deal with the british medical association in july .
of the members participating in the voting , 58 % were opposed to the contract .
in a letter dated thursday , the chairman of the committee on primary medicine , ellen mccourt , said in a letter to the member on thursday that the government had been &quot; consistently silent &quot; in connection with the issue of resistance to the contract .
&quot; in light of this , the executive board of the junior doctors committee has voted to completely reject the proposed new contract and calls for a resumption of formal consultations on all concerns , &quot; she said .
in response to the government &apos; s reticence , the commission &apos; s executive committee has today formally asked the council of the british medical association to hold a special session to approve a long-term plan to upgrade the labour movement from the beginning of september .
the dispute has led to the participation of junior doctors in six strikes this year , including the first all-out strike in the history of the nhs .
dr. johann malawana , senior medical association of the british medical association , resigned after the voting was boycotted by the agreed terms of the contract recommended by the british medical association .
during the 54 000 junior doctors and medical students voting , he had said that he had said that the deal was a good deal and should therefore be accepted .
after the vote , health secretary jeremy hunt said the contract would be imposed on paramedics in england .
russia and turkey : &quot; the league of &quot; ?
a gesture that ended a crisis .
russian leaders talk with turkish leaders on tuesday , with both sides shaking hands and announcing an official closure of eight-month water war with economic sanctions .
however , when vladimir putin greeted the president of turkey in a grand hall in the grand hall of a st. peter &apos;s palace , i felt a strong feeling that the reconciliation was one of ankara &apos;s most promising .
yes , the two sides did shake hands .
however , even in the light of mr. putin &apos;s usual standards of convergence , putin is only 浅浅微笑 , with little enthusiasm .
rejoep tayyip erdoğan reported five references to &quot; good friends &quot; putin , according to the report .
i can &apos;t remember .
at the same time , he promised that his relationship with russia would return to pre-crisis levels and even higher levels .
the next day , a newspaper here wrote that mr erdogan had acted as if nothing had happened .
but i think his passion suggests something opposite .
mr putin &apos;s continued indifference , however , suggests that he has not forgotten anything .
in fact , the first thing he mentioned in his opening remarks was the cause of the crisis : turkey shot down a russian warplane at the syrian border .
moscow &apos;s reaction was intense at that time .
mr putin attacked the incident and accused the ankara of stabbing moscow in the back .
an attack from a so-called friend is even more unacceptable .
it is difficult for both sides to make real trust even impossible .
russia &apos;s public opinion has also reversed since november .
for months , the media , which has been controlled by the government , carried out a shocking full-throated attack on ankara .
suddenly , the turks seem to be responsible for everything .
among them , the most serious came from accusations from senior officials that mr. erdogan &apos;s family profited from the illegal oil deal in the so-called islamic state-held part of syria .
he has categorically denied that assertion .
however , the news from saint petersburg showed that it was time to move on .
after all , the premise of the meeting was that putin had received an apology from president erdogan , president of turkey .
russia can declare victory .
for ankara , the benefits of the truce are obvious .
in the first place , erdoğan had nearly been ousted after last month &apos;s coup , so he needed the support of all his friends .
the ongoing terrorist attacks have apparently shaken him as well .
there are also economic motivations .
russia has imposed sanctions against turkey , in particular the prohibition of sending millions of russian tourists to the turkish coast every year .
the figure has fallen by nearly 90 % .
with the return of flights , russian travel agencies and charter companies are bound to be relieved .
they will usher in the end of the season rush .
national television is even forecast this week , and the price of fruits and vegetables will decline once the imports of turkish agricultural products have been released .
&quot; the tourists went and the tomatoes were back , &quot; said a newspaper vedemosti , a newspaper in moscow .
the visit also has additional political value for moscow .
ankara was angry at the weak response of the western world to the takeover attempt .
in addition , ankara is interested in the slow progress of joining the eu negotiations and the long-standing frustration of mr putin &apos;s engagement , putin &apos;s keen interest in the use of political chill and the weakening of relations between turkey and the western world .
as a result of the defeat of the elected authorities after the coup failed , russia &apos;s leaders will be given the points of ankara .
it was noted that this was a gift for moscow , which had been deeply rooted in fear of regime change .
as a result , a meeting at this magnificent seaside palace has led russia and turkey to form allies in countries that have been rejected and abused by the west , and one analyst described it as &quot; an alien alliance &quot; .
however , despite public reconciliation , significant differences remain between the two sides .
syria is one of the key elements in syria . moscow has played a role in syria in recent years , while russia and turkey have supported the opposite factions .
it was anticipated that , after a preliminary conversation in nearly three hours , the two presidents said at a press conference that the subject had not yet been addressed .
the president of turkey had deliberately avoided the question of the differences between the two sides , and putin stressed .
there is no clear consensus between the two sides on how to seek co-existence on the syrian issue .
the resumption of the dialogue by the leaders of the two countries was certainly a good thing in the wake of a few months of public hostility and massive disaster resulting from the shooting down of two russian warplanes in the member countries of the north atlantic treaty organization .
the royal bank of scotland will no longer serve service outside scotland
the bank will simplify as a logistics sector , according to the rbs chief executive .
the royal bank of scotland will no longer serve as customer service outside scotland .
ross mcewen told the bbc scotland that the royal bank of scotland had been committed to its global ambitions .
but eight years ago he was on the verge of bankruptcy and had to accept relief from that time .
at that time , the brand strategy maker uses the &quot; rbs &quot; to protect other consumer finance brands .
the group has spent millions of pounds to sponsor the international sporting events , such as andy murray , the champion of the rugby six and wimbledon tennis championships .
but right now , the right approach is to get more national brands up .
the royal bank of scotland will be used for scotland &apos;s clients , but it will not respond to it .
in england and wales , all references to headquarters and the stock exchange would be changed to the national bank of westminster .
the alster bank brand has been used for clients in the republic of ireland and the northern ireland autonomous region .
there are also other more prominent private banking brands , such as investing in banks , adam &amp; co , drummond and holt &apos;s militarybank .
mr. mcewen was interviewed in the visit of the customers and employees in inverness county .
&quot; the royal bank of scotland will eventually become our investor brand and one of its employees , because we have become a bank with a large number of brands , &quot; he told bbc scotland .
as the bank itself became an international brand , rbs also became a global brand .
at the moment , i would like to say that we are no longer focused on the global , and we have turned their eyes to the home .
each brand represents the difference in each industry , and our employees are customer service through different brands .
the royal bank of scotland has shown that it will not continue to sponsor the six-nation championship ; at the same time , efforts have been made to raise the profile of different brands &apos; sponsorship of sporting events .
&quot; now is the time to become a multi-brand bank because in private we have been looking for ways to be a better bank for our customers , &quot; the chief executive said .
if we aspire to become a big bank with a lot of brands three years ago , we &apos;d be ridiculed .
now we focus on customer needs , and i believe you have noticed these changes .
i think we can restart these brands , and the time is right now .
dai drew on predilection &apos;s success in newmarket &apos;s success in getting a career 3,000 win
two made 3,000
on friday , the professional jockey frankie dettori won his 3,000 victory in newmarket .
the predilettes of the hands of martin gosden , who took the hands of martin gosden , took two victories in the night and realized a career of 3,000 victories .
the 45-year-old italian was the sixth career horse race in the field in the sixth place in the field .
the top five were sir michael richardson , sir michael smith , and berger piggot , weiner ( patty piggy ) , wei dey ( patty carson ) and robinson ( willie carson ) .
&quot; it &apos;s very special , &quot; said dai tutu , a three-time champion jockey who won earlier in ghayyar .
i &apos;m very excited because my family is on the spot
i &apos;m happy about my achievements in newcastle , since i &apos;m starting here 30 years ago .
this is not a massive jockey club , and it is not the british jockey club jockey club ( royal ascot ) , which is just a general friday evening with more than 20,000 spectators .
i am glad and humble .
after winning the winner , doodle led the predilation , causing the whole field .
in the area of obstacles , two jockeys have achieved this achievement , namely , champion jockey richard johnson ( richard johnson ) and sir mccoy , who is now retired , who won more than 4,300 victories in his record career .
bertuccio was the 9-year competition champion and won 4,493 victories in his career .
daisy was one of the best cyclists in the modern times , so it was not surprising that he had achieved that landmark achievement .
he was stylish and robust , but what really made him stand out in the weighing room was his tactical rationality .
he was a great equestrian ambassador who , for many years , attracted a lot of fans to the campaign .
a few weeks ago , i was in the epstein , i said , if he was not just a weekend and a contest rider , he should have been able to get six thousand victories !
seriously , it is too important to wear the best equestrian winner in the past three decades .
his character is good for the british horse , but in addition , he is an incredible jockey .
dai kutui celebrated the milestone with its iconic jump
from jumping to jump dismount , dettori has been a typical representative of the british field in the past two decades .
his career is like a roller coaster .
he was the champion of a multi-field contest , including the famous &quot; seven wins &quot; of the british jockey club jockey club , in 1996 , but he had also suffered a crash and had been banned for the use of banned drugs .
three years ago , when he returned to the court at the end of the six-month period , he showed amazing personality advantages and finally returned to the summit , giving those who doubted .
he might not have been too long ago - before she had said , he wanted to be at least 50 years old .
russian president vladimir putin &apos;s dismissal of the director of the executive office of the president of the russian federation
russia &apos;s president , vladimir putin , unexpectedly lifted the office of the president of the president of sergei ivanov .
over the years , mr. ivanov has been a member of the nucleus of the nucleus of mr putin &apos;s trust .
ivanov , 63 , has now been appointed special representative for environment and transport .
in a statement by the kremlin , mr putin has &quot; declared the post of director of the russian president of the russian president , &quot; but there is no reason .
anton vaino , who began in 2012 as his deputy , has been appointed as his successor .
mr. vino , 44 , is a former diplomat .
he was born in the estonian capital of tallinn in 1972 and graduated from the famous moscow state institute of international relations ( mg imo ) and worked at the tokyo embassy .
subsequently , he managed the draft presidential and government employees , said the kremlin &apos;s website ( russian language ) .
after he was appointed , he said to mr. putin , &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
i believe that the most important task of the government is to support the implementation of the laws and control instructions of the head of state .
mr. putin told russian television on friday that mr. ivanov himself had asked to resign and recommended mr. vaino to take over himself .
is such a smile convincing ?
moscow was puzzled by the move .
for a long time , sergei ivanov has been one of putin &apos;s closest aides and worked with mr putin and worked in the soviet security service ( kgb ) .
as director of the executive office , he was one of the most influential people in the country .
at a meeting with president putin on national television , both men said the chief of staff had asked to resign .
although there was a full smile before the lens , almost no one was convinced - especially when the parliamentary elections were before the parliamentary elections .
so this is the result of the failure in some power of power ?
it was not yet known .
but the official narrative that a candidate who was once seen as a presidential candidate has suddenly chosen to take the helm of russia &apos;s environmental policies has drawn much skepticism .
in the kremlin &apos;s website quoted mr. ivanov &apos;s dialogue with mr. putin , he said , &quot; yes , early in 2012 , i asked you to give me this difficult position , even in trouble , for a four-year term . &quot;
&quot; as a result , i have been the president of the office of the president for four years and eight months . &quot;
mr. ivanov took up the post in december 2011 .
before that , he served as deputy prime minister and minister of defence .
he is a member of the russian security council and , like mr. putin , is also a former member of the national security council .
in the late 1990s , when mr. putin was director of the fsb ( fsb , formerly the national security service ) , mr ivanov was named as his deputy .
after mr. putin came to power , he had designated mr. ivanov as one of his five most trusted .
the outside world once thought mr. ivanov was likely to be president of the russian presidency after mr. putin &apos;s second term , since three consecutive terms were unconstitutional .
but the position was ultimately attributed to another intimate assistant of mr putin , dmitry medvedev ( dmitry medvedev ) .
until three and a half years later , mr. putin served as prime minister of russia .
mysterious fish surprise banff a garden
one of the residents of banff found a fish out of his garden and then asked for help .
kevin bain thinks the 75 fish could be a sandy eel by a tornado at sea .
mr bain , who lives about 500 metres from the sea , posted a video of the bizarre scene on periscope in the hope that someone could explain to him why the two-inch-long fish would appear .
the custus bridge is now open to faruf
the project of 13.5 billion is scheduled to be completed by may 2017
engineers have linked the northern bridge and viaduct of the queanferry bridge to fife .
the bridge fan , located near the three bridge behind each bridge , is now close to completion , and the project is headed by a dragon &apos;s bridge .
the length of the bridge , which began in farf , was 600 metres , weighing 30,000 metric tons .
it uses 10,000 metric tons of steel , 20,000 metric tons of concrete and 46 cables .
the project of pound13.5 million was planned to be completed in may 2017 .
the secretary of economy , keith brown ( keith brown ) , visited the site today and became one of the first people to reach the bridge .
he said , &quot; this is a historic moment in the construction of the bridge bridge . &quot;
we all have witnessed engineering work on such an ambitious project , which uses more than 300,000 metric tons of concrete and steel in this section of the bridge alone .
although the size and weight of the bridge are enormous , the completion of the bridge between the viaduct and the deck requires fine work , requiring very precise assembly .
in general , nearly 79 % of the total deck is now installed , and the concrete deck of the last deck is pouring in rosyth , which means that all the decks are ready .
&quot; whatever the bridge project , the first dragon is a major milestone , &quot; michael martin said .
in the case of the great project , the dragon shows the advanced civil engineering technique .
after installing the final road panel and connecting it to the extended north bridge panel , the remaining gap between the north side or near the land side is needed .
the completion of the operation required the completion of the operation of the north pole bridge south of 700 millimetres .
this is a great operation , and it is also a very precise operation .
it was said that it was huge , because the tall bridge stood at 22m , weighing about 6,000 metric tons , requiring a roughly 3 per cent tilt .
it is accurate because the engineering team needs to ensure that the deviation is very small , with only a few millimetres on each side .
it is heartening that everything has been progressing well .
simon bears took the woman &apos;s gymnastics full title
forget the pressure .
forget the hype .
simon biles ( simone biles ) is not affected by all that .
the vault was full of vitality .
it is more than ever to swim on the balance .
the movement of free gymnastics is amazing .
the overall performance is very exciting .
now , at last he became the olympic champion .
the 19-year-old american gymnast took full title thursday and displayed her talent for the world &apos;s leading world in the olympic stadium .
her total score was far more than a silver medal winner , &quot; raisman ( aly raisman ) , raisman , and the bronze medal winner , russian mustafina , the russian players .
simon biles , from the united states , carried out a balance beam on thursday in the art women final of the 2016 summer olympics in rio de janeiro , brazil .
bayer helped the u.s. team to a four-point win over the olympic women &apos;s gymnastics individual all-rounder , who has won five medals at the games , further confirming her as a generation and possibly the best team in gymnastics .
at the moment when he saw himself , bears couldn &apos;t help shed tears . she finally finished the long journey .
bears are therefore among the ranks of &quot; decades of athletes &quot; as michael phelps ( michael phelps ) , who will elevate the sports in their respective fields to new heights :
&quot; biles is the best gymnast i &apos;ve ever seen , &quot; said mary · , the 1984 olympic champion , mary · , &quot; said mary · , the 1984 olympic champion .
in brazil there was a last game in brazil , but the game was more competition than bears and other players , as she had a contest between themselves and great expectations .
if biles doesn &apos;t have the gold to return to her home in sprint , texas , everyone will be very disappointed .
simon bears , from the united states , embraced the gold medals and silver medals in the first summer olympics in rio de janeiro , brazil , held in rio de janeiro , brazil , in the summer of 2016 , held in rio de janeiro , brazil , in august .
worship beers won the first gold medal on tuesday , giving a pleasant surprise to the outgoing international coach carol karolyi .
although bears insisted that he did not plan the future in the process of standing up the title , but the fact is not entirely true .
the passage of a passage in the free gymnastics of bears , including her signature , was the latin music , and the music was often heard in a street where she had only one street in the rio olympic stadium .
this is no coincidence .
the girl , who was adopted by grandparents during her infancy and has been spotted by coach amy boorman during a gym field trip , has grown into a powerhouse .
since the summer of 2013 , bears had not lost his hand in the almighty , and she would win if he wanted to win .
it is just an illusion that the mustafina is a little ahead of the rotation .
the balance between the balance wood and the two items of the free gymnastics were in ambush .
she scored 15.433 on her balance and scored 15.933 .
when he waited for the final score , les was held gently with bears . when bears learned about his dream , he left tears .
lehrman &apos;s performance was a bit like revenge for four years ago , and then she was third , but lost to mustantin in the final victory .
but this time , this time , the 22-year-old captain of the united states was far ahead of the 22-year-old captain .
she blew kisses to the crowd after the free gymnastics , declaring a return , but such a return sometimes seemed to be in doubt .
bears were 19 years old . from earlier this week , the news was spread like a virus , and in the case of bears , his life had been given a new meaning .
the six-year-old mahajour , six-year-old , had been spared in the philadelphia rifle
police said a six-year-old boy was shot in philadelphia , and that was the six-year-old boy in the second shot in the city this week .
the child &apos;s grandparents had confirmed to cbsculpate that the shot was majj brown .
they say brown &apos;s groin , legs , arms , and abdomen have a number of gunshot wounds , but the child is awake on the way to hospital .
&quot; he was a lot of sin , and the little body was beaten by the bullet , &quot; his grandmother , delores melen , said to the tv station .
i can &apos;t believe it .
the boy was in a critical condition in the hospital and had undergone a number of surgeries .
his family told television that the child was expected to recover .
he would have begun to read the first grade in a local primary school .
brown is one of the four men who were shot in the germantown area .
of the three others fired , the two were 29 years old and one was 32 years old .
according to cbs philadelphia , one of the victims , 29 years old , was in critical condition ; the other two victims were in stable condition .
television said the child was in critical condition with the 29-year-old and was found in the front seat of the car .
the other victims were not in the vehicle , and the police were investigating whether there were gunshots in the injured personnel .
the investigators told the cbsnake that it looked like a couple of gunshots .
many offensive weapons were found in the scene , which could be inferred that they were using different offensive weapons .
as a result , this is no doubt a 持续战 .
there are shells on the sidewalk on both sides of the street .
&quot; so there were many armed men on the scene at that time , &quot; said anthony ginaldi , chief of the philadelphia police commissioner , told the television station .
many houses and vehicles were damaged in the area .
no arrests have been made and police are said to be tuning in to the surveillance video .
on tuesday , there was a six-year-old child ( girl ) , playing arms in a stream when playing in front of the front door of the westoaklane community .
she is now recovering and the police are still pursuing the suspects .
why do we need simon , gabriel and laurie
that &apos;s why i &apos;m doing this this year &apos;s women &apos;s olympic gymnastic team , not more than one .
first of all , since 1984 , i went to the olympic games every summer , but america has never been so dominant .
second , the team has three excellent gymnasts , simon biles , gabriel douglas ( gabby douglas ) and laurie hernández ( laurent lauriehernandez ) , who have always inspired a large number of coloured girls .
the composition of the team was proud of all , as it contained a synagogue , ali raisman , and catholic madison koroma ( madison kohona ) .
the team finally looked like the united states team .
it has also solidified the position of black and latino women in the sport .
in the last four years , the first female gymnastic athlete has been an african-american .
last year , simon and gabby were ranked first and second .
this is too much .
the last olympic games , gabrielle douglas , unexpectedly became the olympic champion , cheered the united states .
today , the world can witness the performance of the three world champions , simon byrs , douglas and laurie hernandez , who have performed the traditional gymnastics skills to the best of their ability .
on thursday , simon helped the united states of america to achieve four titles on women &apos;s personal-power projects .
her teammate ali lehrman won the silver medal .
we reached the summit of the sport , but this is not the case in the classroom teaching class .
simon , gabrielle and laurie enter the olympic team in the same way as ali and madison .
they are the ultimate five group , because the next olympic gymnastics team will be composed of four gymnastics , which is the last year of pre-service .
but the reality is that gymnastics is a costly exercise , and gymnasts are trained mainly in the private gymnasts and their parents need to pay training , facilities , travel , clothing , competitions and hotel costs , including coaches and gymnasts and family members , and the list is increasing .
most of the gymnastics clubs are located in the rich suburbs that can support the industry .
all training for gymnasts is done at these clubs and is a long-term , expensive expense for the gymnasts &quot; families .
biles &apos;s coach , amy boorman , and hernandez &apos;s coach , maggie haney , have been teaching them since the two gymnastics began to teach them .
we must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to countless young girls who are deeply affected by simon , gabriel and laurie .
twenty years ago , i set up my own gymnastics foundation .
in my organization , we are offering free , low-cost gymnastics to more than 15,000 urban young people ( mainly black and hispanic ) in the black residential area , and have developed national and even world champions .
in september , we will expand to detroit ( my hometown ) and offer high-quality gymnasts to those who deserve this learning and will benefit from this remarkable olympic movement .
gymnastics helps to develop the body &apos;s strength , flexibility and coordination , as well as to cultivate the spirit of hard work , self-discipline and determination .
these can bring life benefits to a person &apos;s health , education and success .
thanks to this team , thousands of young girls will learn gymnastics , which is really good .
participation in sport is of great significance , especially for girls .
this is an exciting time .
thanks to simon , ali , laurie , gabriel and madison , thanks for the &quot; girl power &quot; in winning the olympic gold medal , and thanked them for inspiring young girls so many backgrounds to open up to health , strong and successful road .
after rejecting jeremy hunt &apos;s proposal , the primary doctor plans to launch a further strike
the ministers initially wished to conclude the contract by accepting an amendment to the british medical association ( bma ) officials to put an end to the dispute arising from the change , with 58 per cent against the contract .
in july , mr hunt revealed plans to impose the contract , saying the nhs was currently in a &quot; vacuum zone &quot; and that a slight delay would damage the interests of employees and patients .
the new contract begins with a reference to modifying the working practices of junior doctors throughout the night and weekends in order to improve the care of irregular working hours .
last night , dr. ellen mccourt , chairman of the bma primary committee , said in a statement : &quot; primary doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract , especially fear that it will exacerbate the current labor crisis and do not treat all doctors fairly . &quot;
there is only eight weeks left for the first doctor to sign the new contract , and we need progress , and we &apos;re running out of time .
bma seeks to resolve disputes through negotiations , but people are reluctant to participate , sometimes in silence .
despite that , however , we had been promised jeremy hunt last month , and he said he was always open .
&quot; jeremy hunt now needs to take action to cancel the enforcement and address the concerns of primary doctors .
if he did not do so , the primary doctor clearly indicated that they were ready to take further labour action .
the last strike took place at the end of april at the end of april , which led to nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 appointments , as nurses and doctors were covered by doctors and doctors .
the ministers initially wanted to end the dispute arising from the change by accepting a contract from bma .
the bma wants to secure better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors involved in the contract .
daniel mortimer chief executive officer daniel mortimer called on the primary doctor not to put on any strike again .
&quot; labour action has little effect , &quot; mr. mortimer said , on the contrary , putting pressure on workers , caregivers and their families , concerns , worries and confusion , &quot; mr. mortimer said .
in the past two months , we have been negotiating with the junior college committee and with the ministry of health and other departments to respond positively to their concerns about the role and reporting of guardians .
employers wish to continue to actively explore other important topics , such as deployment , flexibility in training , other training for those who have been heavy after career breaks , training costs , common understanding of curriculum outlines , refresher leave and gender pay differences in the medical field , which show the importance of employers , the england health education organization ( england ) and the ministry of health in november , february and may .
two pounds a day can reduce the threat of heart attack
officials suggested that a drug of 2 pounds a day be extended to more patients and to prolong the medication , and thousands of patients with heart disease would benefit from the drug .
anticoagulant drugs may reduce the risk of heart disease recurrence in patients with heart disease .
this drug continues to take 12 months after a heart attack , which can reduce the risk of a stroke or heart attack .
the national institute of health and clinical excellence ( nice ) , a subsidiary of the nhs , has advised patients to continue taking medications for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease .
but now , nhs nice recommends that the patient continue taking medication for a period of four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiac vascular disease .
in england , about 140 people suffer from heart disease each year , and one quarter will continue to suffer from heart disease recurrence or stroke .
heart disease attack and stroke are caused by the formation of fat material in the artery wall deposition .
if the plaque is disconnected , the thrombosis will lead to a thrombosis , thereby preventing blood flow into the heart , leading to a heart attack .
if the thrombosis moves , they will enter the bloodstream and prevent blood flow into the brain , leading to a stroke .
a patient with a heart attack has undergone a heart attack , and the risk of heart attack is higher .

computer culture leads to the prevalence of &quot; electoral fraud &quot; in the muslim region
the former mayor of towers haman , former mayor of the former mayor of the democratic republic of the congo , had been beaten last year because of corruption and contributed to the publication of a government report .
the &quot; political correctness &quot; culture has turned a blind eye to the widespread electoral fraud in the muslim community , a destructive government report that is so today .
sir eric pickles , former cabinet minister , accused the police , the electoral regulatory agencies and the municipal councils to turn a blind eye to the evidence of the abuse of elections because of &quot; gender-sensitive and religious issues . &quot;
the former community affairs minister , who is currently anti-corruption campaigner , said taking a religious position to intimidate voters was bad , and police should be allowed to set up cordons outside polling stations as a way to protect voters from fear .
he suggested that voters should carry identity documents in order to confirm their identity .
at the moment , voters only need to report their names and addresses .
the report even suggested that the report could be wiped out on the finger finger and prevented a second vote .
sir eric said that the protection of whistle-blowers should be intensified .
he called for increased media awareness of parliamentary documentation and avenues for decisions taken by unofficial committees or working groups .
&quot; this is not just to prevent election fraud , but also to protect local governments from a widespread culture of corruption and the poisoning of financial fraud with which they are closely linked , &quot; he said .
the report follows downing street &apos;s request for a release in the wake of the tower hamlets election scandal in east london .
last year , a special electoral court ruled that there was a spate of corruption and violations in the mayor of the mayor , and that he should be dismissed .
the court found that the &quot; rahman &quot; was very ridiculous to abuse the religious feelings of the muslim community and that the sword referred to his allegations of racial discrimination and islamophobia .
he was said to have voted for him to be a religious duty to be loyal to the muslim . &quot;
as many as 300 votes are in doubt , it may be the voters counterfeit others to vote .
sir eric said there was evidence of electoral fraud throughout the country .
in particular , he warned the post election fraud and said that the senior members of the muslim community were said to have exerted pressure on the electorate , forcing the voters to vote for their designated candidates .
sir eric ( in photos ) gives a number of recommendations on the liquidation mechanism , including with good identification documents to confirm their identity
&quot; the evidence shows that senior members , particularly senior members of pakistani and bangladeshi background communities , have put pressure on vulnerable groups in some minority communities , especially women and young people , to vote according to their wishes , &quot; he said in the report .
&quot; by being overly sensitive to racial divisions and religious &apos; political correctness &apos; , they fear that state institutions will turn a blind eye to such behaviour . &quot;
sir eric made 50 recommendations for the liquidation of electoral mechanisms , including the prohibition of the handling of post ballot papers by political activists to prevent &quot; voting . &quot;
the report also called for an investigation into the registration of information to prevent the electoral rolls from being used for immigration and welfare fraud . theresa may is also considering the report .
these recommendations included the requirement for voters to produce identity documents before voting .
after the voting was cast on the finger of the electorate , the ink on the head of the electorate was wiped out , and there was no second ballot .
systematic verification of the national ownership of the electorate in order to ensure the eligibility of voting .
the validity of the automatic mailing request is limited to three years .
political activists and activists are prohibited from handling completed mailing ballots and mailing envelopes .
the police authorized the police to set up a police cordon around the polling station .
the amendment of the provisions of the law makes it easier to prosecute the persons concerned in accordance with the act of deputies of the people &apos;s republic of china ( &quot; act1983 ) . &quot;
it is illegal to make provision for photo-taking at polling stations .
it provides for the use of english only in the polling stations ( except in the wales area ) .
strengthen training to ensure that staff strictly enforce the provisions of the &quot; voters 去 . &quot;
sir eric gave the metropolitan police station a &quot; surprise &quot; to say that they did not file any charges against the metropolitan police service ( metro manila police ) .
&quot; while there are numerous acts of corruption and violations of the human rights council and its electoral officers , the disqualification of the electoral tribunal has been met , &quot; he said .
he is undoubtedly guilty in many respects , in accordance with the standards of criminal certification .
he also criticized the ineffective &quot; 勾选框 inspection &quot; of the town hall election registration department .
&quot; last year , the court heard a wake-up call to all of you , &quot; said sir eric .
my country has the glory tradition of &quot; the mother of parliament , &quot; but it is a matter of concern that some institutions have privately managed the conduct of electoral fraud and ex-gratia payments , which also threaten the reputation of this good reputation .

primark customers are angry about a woman who is shameless to try to wear underwear in the middle of the store
a woman in a primark store in the middle of the store tried to get her underwear on , and the customer didn &apos;t know where to look .
worse still , she looked at how she was wearing , and then put his underwear off and put it back to the shelf .
she continued to browse the shelves and eventually tried four underwear in the shop in the shopping mall in folkestone .
the woman was trying to wear underwear in the primark store in the shopping mall in folkestone , and then put back the shelves back
jenny davidson , who was also inside the store at the time , said that after trying on the underwear , the mystery woman &quot; got dressed again and went out of the shop and didn &apos;t buy anything . &quot;
&quot; everyone can &apos;t believe what you see , &quot; she said .
she was standing in the middle of the store , taking a pair of panties off the shelf , taking off her tight pants and panties , and then wearing it .
&quot; she didn &apos;t try to find a hidden place to try to wear - she was just standing there , and it was a shameless . &quot;
&quot; everyone was shocked when she took off her underwear again , and obviously she was not satisfied , because she put her underwear back on the shelf . &quot;
after that she tried three , and finally found that it was not her own , and then dressed in good clothes and went out of the shop .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t seem to care about someone watching her - or who will eventually buy the underwear she has tried on .
ms. davidson ( 33-year-old ) , who lived in kent town , said , &quot; i think someone will buy someone who walks through and has not been cleaned . &quot;
this happened on tuesday afternoon .

how to use 马伽术 to protect yourself in a gun attack
the world is dangerous , but this video on dailymail . com might give you a bit of a sense of security .
we asked rhon mizrachi , the master of krav maga federation , in new york , to learn how to approach the gunman at close range .
whether he &apos;s from the front or near you , the video will teach you how to lose .
mizrachi states that if the gunner is near you , the first thing you want to do is to turn around so that you can see the attacker and &quot; clear the fire . &quot;
then put your arms with your forearm and shoulders , and then use your elbow to hit the attacker &apos;s face .
the next knee is on the top of his knee , and when the attacker bent down and bent down , he reversed his gun and beat his face with a gun tube and a reserve gun , keeping his weapon on him .
if the shooter approaches from the front , it also uses similar techniques - to keep your body out of the line of fire , take a gun and reverse the muzzle so that the gunman can &apos;t fire .
at the same time , he pressed the weight against the gun and struck the attacker &apos;s chest and turned the muzzle from his clenched hand , then pointed the gun at him .
that sounds complicated ?
look at the video and see what mizrachi did .
but remember , if you &apos;re not a master of marmite , the safest way to get out of a robbery is to hand over the cash .
a rogue family destroyed a low-rent house in 康沃尔郡索尔塔什 before being expelled
a family of hooligans who were expelled because of the threat of intimidation were damaged by intimidating neighbours , causing damage to their rental housing , resulting in a loss of pound50,000 .
after a long list of complaints , tanya skeldon and his husband , shaun trebilcock , were driven out of the low-rent rental housing located in contamine county .
after being forced out of the shelter , the housing society officials were surprised to find that there was serious damage to it .
the wall was full of holes , and the floor was torn , and the garbage was thrown in full , and the walls were painted in a mess .
after being expelled , the family has been moving , and is said to be living in a private home
donna mcei , the housing manager of the contamcounty housing institute , said she feared that the house had been unable to rescue .
&quot; it &apos;s a nightmare for people living here , &quot; she said . &quot; i don &apos;t think people can live like this . &quot;
there are lots of things that need to be weighed , because the house is likely to be a bad element in the county .
the family is notorious and their names are also notorious .
the couple have three sons , and they will stay here , and police say the terrorist acts include the use of baseball sticks to fight and intimidate residents , drug use , drug trafficking , shouting , quarreling , and curses .
in june , the 47-year-old tenant named skeldon had received a resolution on anti-social behaviour .
in the house where the house could be demolished , many of the rooms were placed in a long time
the floor was raised in the room where the drug had been traded
the neighbors said they often saw them fighting in the streets , and they were often called the police
after an 11-week extension giving them voluntary relocation , the cornwall housing association forcibly removed her and her husband from the residence this week .
at last , the neighbors cheered , and they said that the past life was simply a hell of hell .
&quot; they don &apos;t care about anyone , &quot; said one neighbor .
we lived next to them for 20 years , and we have been so bad .
we have seen the police gates countless times .
&quot; we could not have been able to sleep this morning . &quot;
we got up early because it was so quiet - we weren &apos;t used to it yet !
it was wonderful that they had finally gone .
&apos;the family hasn &apos;t worked well with the local government , &apos; said adam fitzpatrick , the community executive director of the cornwall housing association .
the family lived in the house for 20 years , and the police often visited
the junk and the old toys were thrown on the side of the flat .
he added : &quot; it is regrettable that the tenant was not held responsible for her actions with her family and that the eviction was the last consideration of the cornwall housing society . &quot;
it is a very difficult case to deal with , because their behaviour is extremely extreme , and their actions must be extremely frightened by their actions .
i thank my team for the work done , and i would like to thank the police and the members of the community who were brave enough to provide us with information .
i hope that the move will bring some comfort to the neighbors and convey such a message that we are not tolerant of anti-social behaviour .
mr. fitzpatrick said that their three sons lived in the house in different times , but they were all in their twenties .
after they were removed , one bedroom on the floor also threw a dirty mattress on the floor .
housing workers will soon clean up the piles of rubbish around the house
police had searched the house in 2014 and found 70dock cannabis and also found scales , drug paraphernalia and £ 1,700 in cash .
after having pleaded guilty , skeldon was fined for possession of b-class drugs and drug trafficking .
she claims that the money was used to buy a tombstone for lee skeldon , her son who died in a car accident in 2013 .
it was understood that tanya and her husband now lived in a private house in plymouth .
the house was filled with graffiti on the walls of the house .
the police said they would evict tenants who disobey the tenant &apos;s rules .
according to angelina crow at the county police station in dresden county , the expulsion sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to resist the tenant &apos;s rules .
&quot; this warning is directed against those who believe that their behaviour will not be blamed , and those who suffer from such acts , &quot; she said .
deloitte and the county police station are in no way tolerant of crime and anti-social behaviour , and they will continue to work together to protect our communities .

the french court rejected the petition to dismantle shops in the jungle refugee camps
a court in france denied the government &apos;s intention to dismantle dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the &quot; jungle &quot; refugee camps , which currently reside in thousands of refugees in the refugee camps .
at the court &apos;s hearing this week , the government argued that the government of france should have the right to dismantle a total of 72 temporary shops in the refugee camp , selling goods from cigarettes to energy drinks , offering haircuts , and selling prices for 50 cents ( 40 pence ) in makeshift restaurants or selling basic meals in a number of euros .
the office of the governor of gaulle believes that these places should be removed because they are parallel economies that do not pay taxes , and there are fires and health hazards .
the humanitarian community has been extremely important for the court to express these shops and restaurants , as the free food provided by the state-supported association and other groups cannot meet the needs of the growing refugees in the refugee camps .
they say these makeshift shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to people in need .
the lille court ruled that there was no legal basis to expel the operator of the 72 temporary stores , but said the governor &apos;s concern was &quot; entirely understandable . &quot;
mr. jean françois molla , judge jean-françois molla , said the role of these grocery stores , cafes and restaurants is far more than simply providing food to those who live under extremely dangerous conditions . &quot;
he said these places were a calm point of convergence between refugees and volunteers .
one of the dismantled threats was the &quot; jungle bookshop &quot; café in the refugee camp , which provides 200 food , english and french classes every day and offers asylum recommendations for hundreds of unaccompanied minors in the refugee camps .
more than 17,000 people signed a petition to protect the cafe .
closing the cafe &quot; would be a disaster for these children ( as many as eight years old ) , &quot; wrote a letter to the guardian .
two charities , help refugees and l &apos;auberge des migrants , predicted on friday that the number of refugees in the jungle camp had broken through 9000 , the highest level since the surge in the number of refugees in the summer .

the project , which belonged to mechanical processing enterprises , applied for the initial discharge rate of 0.514 tons of chemical oxygen demand ( cod ) and 0.052 tons of ammonia nitrogen ( nox ) .
air pollutant emission rights are used and traded for the central industrial enterprises of electricity and heat production in the city .
as of 1 january 2016 , existing sewage units which have been granted an eia are not subject to payment of royalties .
&quot; the right to access to sewage is not equal to the power to obtain an illegal discharge , and does not discharge pollutants freely . &quot;
liu hongyan , deputy director of the hong kong environmental protection agency , said that it would not be possible to circumvent the penalty through the means of purchasing the right to sewage , if the illegal discharge and excess discharge would still be punished in accordance with the relevant legislation .
in other words , by means of legal means , we should crack down on environmental violations and punish the excessive discharge of enterprises so as to protect the environment and ensure public health .
in the interests of their own interests , enterprises have increased the motivation of cure , cherish the limited amount of sewage and reduce pollutant discharge .
as a result of economic benefits , reducing pollutant emissions from government enforcement to the enterprise &apos;s conscious market behavior , thus actually achieving the purpose of protecting the environment , protecting nature and ensuring public health .
the emission rate , also known as &quot; emissions rights &quot; , is the right to discharge pollutants , meaning the right of the emitters to discharge pollutants into the environment within the limits allocated by the government in accordance with the law .
this right is , in essence , the right of shall to the possession , use and benefits of environmental capacity resources .
in the next step , the amount of pollutant discharge is transferred through a currency exchange between the sources of pollutant emissions without exceeding the allowable emissions .
emissions trading has since been introduced by american economist dales in 1968 , the united states began to apply it to the management of atmospheric and river pollution sources in the 1970s .
we started the pilot in 2007 and there are now 14 provinces ( districts , cities ) in zhejiang and jiangsu .
according to the russian ministry of defence , the russian ministry of defence provided support for the implementation of the six strategic bombers in the air strike against the &quot; islamic state &quot; target in syria , and multi-russian warplanes supported the launch of the syrian air force base from the syrian arab republic .
on 22 february this year , the united states agreed to an agreement with russia on the ceasefire between the parties to the syrian conflict and the ceasefire was commenced on 27 january .

china &apos;s plan for mars is here
our mars exploration mission is to carry out a tour , landing , tour , and this form is never seen abroad .
the target of mars detection in our country is to make a step around , landing , tour , and this task has considerable difficulty .
because mars detects a time window for 26 months to detect mars detection , experts are closely developing a project plan to launch the first mars probe into this window in 2020 .
although our vehicle has entered deep space , it is essential to complete the mars exploration mission , which means china is moving from a real meaning to an era of deep-space exploration , xu said .
&quot; every two years or three years , mars is the nearest chance of mars to launch mars detectors at this time , and it is the most energy source for the launch vehicle . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the quality of the mars detector , it will be carried out by our country &apos;s long march launch vehicle .
the mars exploration mission in our country is to carry out the surrounding , landing , tour , and this form is never done abroad , and the country has been prepared to meet and landing at once , but the landing failed .
mars exploration is very much in the field of technology , in particular because it is a space detector , but it has distinct features compared with a general space probe .
in other words , the mars probe will have the ability to determine the route and detect the obstacles .
&quot; the reason humans are so keen on mars exploration is because the exploration of mars has important scientific and technological implications , even for the future of mankind , &quot; said pang chun , a researcher at the china space technology group &apos;s five institutions .
at present mars has become a planet of the highest level of human research beyond the earth , and the history of mars exploration through space detectors is almost cross-cutting in the history of human space .
we therefore hope that humanity will someday establish a residence base in mars , eventually to mars and to turn it into the second home of mankind .
there are plenty of signs that mars is likely to be the same as the current earth , just after billions of years of evolution into a thin , low temperature , low water supply and so on .
so a probe or a manned landing on mars could put a plan in place to prevent earth from becoming the second mars to survive .
as of june 2016 , a total of 114 lunar exploration and 43 mars detection were conducted globally .
however , from the 1990s to date , however , human beings carried out 18 mars detection , while the lunar probe conducted only 14 times .
there are currently five mars orbiter and two mars rover working , but only one lunar orbiter and one lunar lander are working .
the world &apos;s space-faring nations have developed a detection plan aimed at the mars system , which shows that today &apos;s mars detection is hotter than the lunar probe .
on 5 november 2013 , india launched the first mars probe &quot; manga , &quot; which became the first country in asia to successfully detect mars .
&quot; manga &quot; is used to study the surface , atmospheric and mineral characteristics of mars and explore the signs of methane and life on mars .
the hardest part of the mission was when the probe entered the martian atmosphere and the pneumatic shape and the parachute slowed only once
the mars reconnaissance mission faces many technical challenges , according to sun 泽洲 , chief designer of the mars detectors of the five of china &apos;s space science and technology group .
the atmospheric pressure on mars is low , and only one per cent of the surface pressure of the earth &apos;s surface has high uncertainty .
scientists have no thorough knowledge about its changes and the characteristics of the storm .
in the summer , mars often produces dust storms similar to the earth &apos;s dust storms , which will lead to a sharp fall in the sun &apos;s solar energy , and it is necessary to design a &quot; hibernation &quot; model for the spark vehicle , so that it waits patiently to wait for dust storms .
at the same time , the mars atmosphere also has a reduction in solar light , which poses a problem for the energy supply of mars .
this requires that the detector &apos;s solar wings be bigger , and it needs to be adjusted constantly , trying to focus on the sun .
moreover , mars surface gravity is only 38 per cent of the earth &apos;s surface gravity , but the gravity of the surface is mostly high , and the detectors require greater power .
&quot; the most central and difficult place for the mars exploration mission is that the probe enters the martian atmosphere in the process of pneumatic and parachute , with only one chance to ensure success . &quot;
according to sun zang , the entire process cannot be controlled by the ground because the earth is far away from mars and the entire process cannot be controlled by the ground .
owing to the absence of so many propellants to offset the high speed , the slowdown would depend on the role of the mars atmosphere , but the atmosphere was difficult to simulate on the ground .
overall said , in general , the way to detect mars is similar to that of the moon , &quot; around , fell , drinks , back , &quot; and ultimately the goal of manned landing on mars .
because mars is far away from earth than the moon , mars needs a series of more complex technical difficulties .
according to taiwan media reports , the &quot; administration of the administration &quot; announced yesterday morning that &quot; political parties and their attached property treatment regulations &quot; have entered into force today .
&quot; the kuomintang vice-chairman of the kuomintang said , &quot; one hundred years of history of the kuomintang , with social commitment and responsibility , will not fail . &quot;
the secretary-general emphasizes that , in cases of violations of the prohibitions imposed by the political parties , accompanying organizations or trustee , the committee will investigate and &quot; punish and punish &quot; in accordance with the terms of reference and &quot; in accordance with the law . &quot;
deforestation also announced the misconduct of the party committee , which will be held by the &quot; deputy director of agency &quot; hong kong .
he said he was a non-member of the main committee of the commission on the misconduct of the communist party on the basis of the experience of the commission in the past to examine the relevant gross cases and would serve as the basis for the committee to inventory the related cases of misconduct .
today , as long as the communist party has a party , no one will give you social contributions , and the kuomintang has just been able to ask for social support and sponsorship . &quot; today there is no chance to go . &quot;
the kuomintang party has not been completely confiscated , confiscated , and the remaining remains under the commitment to donate it , and the rest of the party will return to zero , and the party shall all start with zero , even after the failure of the party &apos;s regulations on the road .

&quot; zhang huizhen , a 27-year-old korean archer , won a gold medal in women &apos;s archery competition and won a double as the team won after the match , according to international media .
zhang deguang was thought to be a very late player , and she was sorry to have no tickets for the last olympic games , and now proudly stood at the top of the olympic games .
zhang lo won the gold medal in the women &apos;s archery individuals final in the avenue stadium in brazil .
she first shot the arrow at the fourth grade of the primary school until the 27-year-old olympic gold medal for the first time in the world cup .
zhang hui recalled that there was no level before the upper secondary school so that she could not be able to take part in the country &apos;s competition .
zhang feng , who won four years ago in the london olympic games , was only a fourth and a pity for winning the olympics , but only one day as a co-worker and a friend of friends to seize two gold medals .
in the end of the shooting ceremony of the woman &apos;s archery of the woman &apos;s archery , mr cheung said , &quot; until the end of the shooting , &quot; he said , &quot; and it might be a good result .
chifu , a 28-year-old south korean archer and london olympic archery event gold medalist , won the bronze medal .
chateau-fu won a bronze contest in the semi-finals of the semi-final semi-finals with a bronze contest with the mexican player adriana valencia .
it is conceivable that chateau-fu plays the game in ensuring the lactation of bronze after a bronze medal .
first of all , the training group has accumulated rich experience in continuous research , followed by scientific training , all of which require long-term accumulation .
the archery team helps the team to focus and stay normal by means of military training and night crossing of the cemetery .
although it has not been confirmed , many sources say apple will be in september 2016 , and the iphone 7 is really going to come .
apple did not respond , but there has been news about the features and configuration of the new iphone , and even the iphone7 &quot; machine model &quot; image on the web .
the new generation of the iphone is &quot; millions of eyes , &quot; hot , hot and rich ... if you want the first time to buy it , you must choose a good channel , for example , suchinin .
this has exacerbated the disappointment of new mobile phones , &quot; it has been extended , but no holographic images can be projected ! &quot; the iphone is worse . &quot;
iphone7 , like the other iphone , is accompanied by countless anecdotes .
in addition , there are a number of sources claiming that the new generation of iphone will cancel the 3.5 mm headphones interface to a bluetooth connection and charging interface , which will provide a space for apple to add a second speaker .
another evidence to support the news is that apple in 2014 allowed headphone makers to produce headphone products connected through the charging interface .
these messages are either true or false , the answer is until the opening of the apple in the autumn of 2016 .
but this does not hinder industry &apos;s prospects for the iphone 7 - many believe that the iphone 7 would be likely to be an apple last big upgrade of the iphone series .
the market share of the iphone has declined , despite the recent data published by market idc .
among them , goldman maintained the &quot; buy &quot; rating of apple &apos;s shares , while bmo analysts believed that iphone7 would reap a historic sales record .
at the same time , botong ceo , ceo of botong , also said apple &apos;s future revenue increase would be more than 20 % , and this would benefit entirely from the launch of iphone7 .
seven percent of those surveyed said they had plans to buy the iphone 7 , compared with only 4 per cent in the first two years ago .
it was understood that 20 per cent of the user groups currently holding the iphone 6 or 6plus were to buy the iphone 7 , a fairly high proportion .
second , with expert analysis , most of the powders prefer to replace their iphone mobile phones .
according to statistics , about 26 per cent of users in all iphone users have not replaced their mobile phones in two years , or nearly 1.2 billion users have been using the iphone for two years .
according to the media , there were several earthquakes in taiwan during the production of the iphone 7 production , which was more than imagined and could have an impact on the initial iphone 7 supply . &quot;
the contradiction between supply and demand will affect ordinary users , and it is time to choose a good channel , first time to start the iphone 7 .
in the near future , mr su ning met with apple in order to prepare a sufficient source of goods , according to the person familiar with the person familiar with the matter .
the operator already talks with suen , and it is foreseeable that , with the depth of cooperation between the two sides , it will inevitably bring lower prices and more sensitive services to users .
&quot; the lowest price , consumers may &quot; need seven yuan a day to buy the iphone 7 . &quot;
the abundant supply source and a variety of preferences make it easier to buy the iphone 7 no longer &quot; pressure mountain , &quot; and suen &apos;s logistics will become a more intuitive sense of experience .
maybe you &apos;ll get a call in the middle of the middle of the night , &quot; hello , sue , and your iphone 7 . &quot;

in the first night in the middle of the diving pool , the organizers were working overtime to deal with the problem of the diving pool in the evening , but the color of the pond was rapidly changing in the morning .
while the australian team worked with the japanese team , the environment conditions were deteriorating gradually , but officials stressed that they would return the water quality to their original colors on 11 november .
mario andrada , a spokesman for the rio olympics , said : &quot; yesterday afternoon , the water &apos;s level of alkaline water became weaker in the first place . &quot;
&quot; we have learned a series of causes that might trigger the color of the pool and the inclusion of water . &quot;
water sports centres carried out a series of tests of water quality , and hundreds of divers and swimmers used the pool to determine the quality of water quality . &quot;
&quot; we have been a normal procedure for these days , but we may overlook the potential impact of athletes on water quality . &quot;
&quot; but water color changes are certainly not affected , especially for athletes . &quot;
&quot; this independent team confirmed our assessment and confirmed the steps we took to restore normal colours and normal chemical conditions in the pool , &quot; he said .
&quot; we would have hoped that the swimming pool would be normal in the morning , but the speed of recovery was affected by the rain . &quot;

on the morning of 12 august , the state council information office held a press conference on the operation of the national economy in july 2016 .
national information , a spokesman for the national bureau of statistics and the director of the integrated national statistics division , said that in july , the economic component of the national economy slowed down , but still operated in a reasonable range .
the data released by the national bureau of statistics show that data on the growth rate of fixed assets in july and the total amount of imports declined .
on the state of the national economy in july , i would like to borrow a word from the premier on the state of the national economy in july , and i would like to borrow a word from the prime minister , &quot; which is better summed up in july &apos;s economic performance .
he explains that &quot; volatility &quot; means that some of the economic indicators have slowed in july .
since the economy is still in deep adjustment in july and abroad , the international situation is complex and volatile , and the world economy &apos;s recovery is less than expected , so export pressure is relatively large .
in the case of domestic circumstances , the entire economy is also in the critical phase of adjustment , the pain of the adjustment is being released , the economy faces a little downward pressure , and some of the indicators fluctuate .
in july , there was a special case in july , and the floods were more severe , and the hot summer weather had some effect on production operations in some areas .
according to the recent issuance of the ministry of civil affairs , more than 6,000 million people were affected by the ministry of civil affairs , with a direct economic loss of over $ 20 billion .
in terms of industrial , investment and transport-related indicators , these areas have been affected to varying degrees .
in july , the volume of cargo turnover increased by 3.6 percentage points over the previous month , and the flood disaster had a certain impact on the traffic in those areas .
from these factors , the volatility of some of the indicators for the month of july is also normal and is expected to be expected .
&quot; the potential is still good , &quot; he said , &quot; despite the slowdown in economic growth , the overall stability and stability of the economy , he said , did not change in stability and stability .
the cpi rose by 1.8 % in july , and the ring rose by 0.2 % , and the price situation was generally stable .
according to the chongqing meteorological bureau portal , the statistics of high temperature weather in each district county , except in the city , can receive varying degrees of high-temperature benefits .
currently , at least 28 provinces in the country have clear criteria for the issuance of allowances , although the standards are not the same in the provinces , whereas in chongqing the high-temperature allowance is paid in the form of a high-temperature weekday allowance .
less than 37 ° c below 37 ° c shall be issued at less than 10 yuan per person per person per person per day ; more than 37 ° c shall be issued per person per person per person per person per person per person .
above 40 ° c , high temperature staff may receive a maximum of 20 yuan / day allowance per month ( with the exception of the worker &apos;s allowance for high temperature jobs in accordance with the law ) .
according to this standard , the most high-temperature weather station was able to receive 330 yuan last month , and the lowest number of days was 80 yuan , while the highest temperature is not high because of the non-high temperature standard .
in the past , a number of units would offset the high temperature allowance with cool drinks , and the city said it was not in line with the current approach .
the employing units shall not deduct or reduce the wages of workers due to the cessation of the work and the reduction of working hours due to high temperature weather .
according to misers , the employee has not received a high temperature allowance at high temperature , but can seek legal rights or appeal to the 12333 in the labor dispute mediation agency in which the enterprise is located .
if the employing unit refuses to issue a high-temperature allowance , the worker may lodge a complaint with the competent human security department of the human resources social security department at the county level .
at the same time , since the high temperature allowance is part of the wage , it is not a benefit , it should be included in the total wages and deductions .
as a result , the high temperature allowance is not within the minimum wage and must be issued in a cash form and cannot be replaced with beverages such as beverages .
the newly constructed urumqi station is located in the high-iron area in urumqi city , with an overall area of about 10 square metres .
the first and second floors of the ground are on the ground floor , waiting room and office , business premises , and the first floor of the ground .
at present , urumqi station is the largest integrated transport hub in xinjiang , which integrates high-speed rail , crossrail , public transport , rental and so on .
the platform is located on both sides of the platform and the north side of the station , with a total of 39 manual sales tickets and 34 automatic vending machines .
in the area of the waiting hall , there are 30 channels on both sides of the waiting hall , and the passengers can check the ticket according to the ticket number on the ticket .
if you need help , you can choose the 41 call buttons set up within the station , and can be provided with timely service .
from july 1 , the old station , the passenger train from the urumqi south station , took a step to the urumqi station .
in other words , all moving cars and 30 trains can be stopped at urumqi station .
now both stations can be bought by car , the train between them lasts about 10 minutes , and passengers need to pay attention to the location of the ticket and the location of the terminal .
the official input of the new passenger station in urumqi will become an important platform for xinjiang to build a national integrated traffic city and push forward the &quot; silk road belt &quot; and new area building .
greta is a growing female bird , and the smell of tropical rain forests is distributed throughout the world .
in the central american countries , costa rica , the toucans bird gracian and its story are well known .
at a press conference on 10 august , gray west , after surgery , finally appeared to show its brand new 3d printing plastic bird beak .
it was only a year half a year before the man broke the beak , the dying giant bird , and now finally regain its freshmen .
it was a day when it declared that it had been a 100 % recovery , but it moved into a deluxe bird , and the days of meeting with its human friends .
in the new home , greta was shy , but it became lively , but it became lively in the water basin , with a new beak to eat grapes .
to remind people about the damage it had suffered , technicians did not paint their new beak , but retained the original white of 3d printing materials .
the bird &apos;s beak is a thin , thin sheath sheath , which is hollow inside , and there is only a few fine bone support rods .
in spite of this internal reinforcement , the beaked bird &apos;s beak is still fragile and will break when it is hurt .
animal rescue center , bird class scientists and a united states 3d printing company have worked together to produce several &quot; test beak &quot; for greta , and finally created the &quot; perfect beak &quot; for its &quot; perfect beak . &quot;
now greta has been able to use new beak to drink , eat things , and even peck small grains .
&quot; the final product design takes about two months , printing out only four or five hours . &quot;
&quot; 3d printing isn &apos;t the future technology , and it has actually entered your life , &quot; said thomas langg , chairman of the united states sg3 printing firm , in an interview with international reporters in china .
in january 2015 , in january 2015 , a farm in grey western province , central , costa rica , was found to be found in the blood-blood giant gray .
at that time , its beak was brutally broken by a group of young men . it was completely unable to eat and was in danger of dying .
in the aftermath of the tragic media report of gray western asia , gray &apos;s tragic media raised a wave of opposition to abuse of animal in both internal and outside costa rica .
there is a call for stricter animal protection laws and increased penalties for abusers .
people came spontaneously and tried to do their utmost to help grey western asia restore the lives of the injured before the injury .
even three-dimensional printing technology inventors are also involved in the design of greta &apos;s beak .
&quot; the situation in gray is very special , with the remaining part of its beak is less than 1 cm , so many difficulties are brought to the installation of the new beak . &quot;
&quot; we are looking forward to greta scanning , and then design and produce a longer prosthesis that is longer than the remaining part of its beak , with glue fixed on its beak . &quot;
&quot; this can reduce further invasive damage to gracian , &quot; says told xinhua international reporter .
prior to the installation of the prosthesis , staff members are required to clean up their beak for tigray to prevent infection .
far away from a thousand miles away , the story of greybird gray was moved by the famous documentary director , paula eredia and the producer of journalism , john hoffman .
they recorded a few drops of dots in the new beak in gray western asia , recording a documentary on the kingdom of the bird , which had been broadcast on the animal-star channel this month .
the documentary film the kingdom of big bird tells people how a little bird bird is how to make a country change , how to make a citizen involved in the fight against abusive animals .
central tip : japanese oil companies are particularly wary of the rise of a small , independent oil refinery known as the &quot; teapot . &quot;
japan &apos;s export expansion is one of the reasons why china &apos;s export expansion is one of the reasons why china &apos;s biggest oil companies , jx energy , said on 12 august .
japanese oil companies are particularly wary of the rise of small and independent oil refineries known as the &quot; teapot . &quot;
the quality of china &apos;s petroleum products is gradually approaching japanese oil products as a result of the chinese government &apos;s toughening of environmental regulations .
prior to obtaining the import license of crude oil , the &quot; teapot refinery &quot; generally imported sulphur content with high sulphur content from russia .
the high sulphur content in the production of petroleum products is high , and the oil products are poor and become one of the causes of environmental pollution .
after obtaining an import licence for crude oil , the &quot; teapot refinery &quot; can import 阿曼产 crude oil and russian crude oil , and the quality of its petroleum products has also increased .
&quot; as china &apos;s domestic oil product quality standards have continuously improved , the ability of refining equipment has also increased as china &apos;s domestic oil product quality standards have been improved .
as a result , china &apos;s exports of petroleum products have gradually reached the same level as japan ( the world &apos;s highest quality ) .
jx energy said &quot; after the end of 2015 , china began to export high-quality light oil to australia &quot; to compete with japanese products in the asian market .
although &quot; japanese high-quality oil &quot; is facing a crisis , the response strategy adopted by japanese oil companies is simply &quot; to pay attention to the market and to export to the profitable areas . &quot;
due to the great influence of china &apos;s exports of petroleum products on the asian market , the visibility of the teapot is becoming more and more high .

not only is the ultraviolet light not only the skin &apos;s skin , not only the skin , but also the skin , how to make the skin smooth through military training , not by the sun ?
the sunscreen packaging is generally marked by spf and pa , which is the sun-proof index , which is targeted at uvb uv light , and our common spf index is 15 , 30 and 50 .
with pa-marked products are targeted at uva , such a sunscreen will play a more effective role , usually with + as + as + to express an effective protection time .
oily skin should choose the more permeable water protection products , sunscreen is also a good choice .
dry skin skin should choose a frost-like protective clothing ; neutral skin is generally not strict , sensitive skin is a burden on the skin . it is recommended that pure physical protection products should be selected .
remember to apply sunscreen in advance half an hour because it takes time for sunscreen products to penetrate into the skin .
when the military training day is long , the sunscreen has a lasting effect every two hours , and do not steal .
because the skin had just been inspired by the sun , the military training returned not to use white-white products at once .
after the military training is burning , such as conditional towels are used to pack the ice into the ice town to burn the damaged skin to slow the local heat .

on some nights , the ionosphere is full of free electrons , which means that radio signals can go farther .
the american air force was interested in replicating the effect , according to the american journal of mass science , on 11 august .
although a stable mass of free electrons can help people listen to the radio station on the margins of a university radio station , this may not be the interest of the united states air force .
the electronic ionospheric ionosphere means that the radio has a bigger picture of the radio , and it may provide some protection for the global positioning system ( gps ) signals from the impact of solar storms .
the ultimate goal may be to build a series of cube satellites based on demand , and they can strengthen the ionosphere when needed .
but first , the team of these agreements with the air force must prove that the relevant scientific principles will work .
industry data show that the total size of coal capacity in 2015 is close to about 60 billion tons , with a total of 18 billion tons of coal in the country .
over the last decade , the state council has issued a total of five notifications of excess capacity and backward capacity before and after the state council .
although the first four did not target the coal industry , the target industry had a direct relationship with the coal industry .
last november and january this year , in january this year , the prices of 5,500 high-power coal prices in the qinhuangdao island had been hovering over 370 yuan / ton , and 90 per cent of the coal enterprises fell into a loss .
since february , coal prices have risen gradually , with recent qinhuangdao coal prices rising around four weeks , rising to a peak of 16 months , rising to $ 436 per ton , up nearly 70 yuan from the beginning of the year .
as prices rebound , concerns grow that a small coal mine will not resume production ?
in this regard , china ( hainan ) has conducted an analysis and interpretation of the director of the institute for reform and development of the institute of development .
the high level of attention paid by the parties to the production capacity of the coal industry today is also really worried by the high level of attention paid to productive capacity .
these three surface factors reflect the fact that the relative lag in our growth approach in the past is that the government growth approach has not yet been fundamentally transformed .
second , this is also directly related to the push ahead of the local government , and in the process of generating capacity , funding and corresponding matching measures are in place , and the differences in different regions are indeed relatively large .
third , if some of the provinces that are currently relatively slow are to make progress in the second half of the year , they may face greater risk .
in this case , the process of relying on central prize money to boost capacity may have a negative impact .
first , the production capacity is not simply a simple overall control .
our aim is to reconstruction the structure of the whole coal industry by eliminating backward production capacity , advancing the structure optimization and rebuilding the whole coal industry .
in the process of deploying 去产能 , local governments must combine the transformation of the coal industry and coal industry to develop the related services .
second , in order to complete this year &apos;s production capacity this year , we still need to give full play to the power of administrative supervision and administrative supervision .
finally , we need to strengthen the supporting role of social security .
because the market is directly related to the problem of employment , we need to strengthen job skills training for employees and workers .
&quot; the decline is due to the expected deterioration in gdp growth in brazil in the medium term . &quot;
in 2015 , brazil &apos;s participation in global direct investment was 3.7 per cent , down from 5.7 per cent in 2014 .
the imf international investment attraction index includes four sub-sub-indicators : infrastructure , economic prospects , commercial environment and direct investment volume .
in 2015 , brazil &apos;s international direct investment amounted to $ 646 billion , less than $ 731 billion in 2014 .
last year , brazil &apos;s &quot; greenfield investment &quot; ( investment model for investing abroad ) was $ 179 billion , a decrease of 2.1 % over the same year .
&quot; there are a total of 288 &quot; greenfield investment &quot; projects in brazil , compared with 314 years from 2003 to 2014 . &quot;
however , in the first half of 2016 , international direct investment in brazil had reached $ 338 billion , an almost 10 % increase compared to the same period last year .

in the video , a man with a black hat was reading the koran , referring to crimes against muslims , and vowed to launch an attack on a city in canada soon .
in the video , he said the attack would take place within 72 hours , and it was at peak time .

after the upgrade of the renovation of the beijing-hangzhou grand canal , the yangtze river , the north great barrier reef on 9 september shall receive toll toll .
the two tributaries of these tributaries take social financing ways to overhaul construction , and the charge has been approved by the relevant departments of the provincial government .
the old edmond river channel flows through township , new , and into the main channel of the beijing grand canal , with a total length of 32.5 km .
according to the requirement of navigation , the method of the conservation transformation of the old fukui river waterway was carried out , and the conditions of navigation were improved and the conditions of navigation were improved and the conditions of navigation were improved .
the waterway runs through the jinxiang county , nintendo city , the main course of the main waterway through the south-yang lake and the main route of 19 kilometers .
the renovation of the two waterways began in february 2011 and the acceptance of the contract was completed in january 2015 , with the investment construction and operation subject being the city of jining anping canal logistics service centre .
according to the principle of &quot; loan construction and repayment of fees , &quot; the jining canal logistics service centre shall levy tolls on the basis of the fee standard for the approval of prices in shandong province .
of which , the base toll is calculated at $ 1.75 / dtt and the mileage toll is calculated at 0.05 yuan / km .
the toll of toll collection was on 15 june 2016 and on 14 june 2019 .
the reporter learned from jining pmb that there are currently four fees in jining , the 洙水 river channel , the white horse , the northern skating waterway , and the old 万福河 .
four channel for the beijing-hangzhou grand canal branch of the channel , all took social financing way to upgrade and upgrade .
the lanes is the first to use the &quot; government + market &quot; model for the construction of the basis infrastructure in shandong province .
it is the way of a pure market-oriented way to operate the river channels such as the white ma river , the old river river and the north great leaf river .
the financial resources allocated by the state cannot meet the needs of the construction of the project , constraining the pace of the upgrading of the waterways .
the use of social capital for public infrastructure is in accordance with the requirements of national policy , which also serves as a way to break the bottleneck of funds .
ningbo tao tao &apos;s performance in the 100-meter freestyle semi-stroke semi-finals has allowed many chinese audiences to speak .
in the 50 meter freestyle pre-race , ningbo , ningbo , once again refresh the people &apos;s &quot; bottom line . &quot;
in fact , the 50-meter freestyle is not the master of ningbo , and his performance and best performance in the kishan expo , and the possibility of a breakthrough in this project is not big .
indeed , the biggest reason for ningbo &apos;s failure is that he has lost interest in swimming , according to the official gazette of hong kong &apos;s authoritative media .
many of the factors off the counter may have a big impact on his future ideas , and he is now likely to be more interested in the recreation circle .
after the world championships , ning peter , with its high 颜值 and good grades , became a 网红 in a moment .
so the name of a &quot; husband &quot; , &quot; small &quot; meat &quot; , &quot; tricks &quot; , etc . , is constantly being labeled as a label on him .
all sorts of commercial activities come to the door , better money , make a golden light flashing .
in this case , ningbo tao , even if you choose to retire into the entertainment circle at this time , is not only his freedom , but also a plausible path .
after all , after all , he was only 23 years old , and after a certain degree of study , it was entirely possible for his popularity to play in two tv series .
but ningbo is needed to see if you have enough qualifications compared with these predecessors ?
at the 2000 sydney olympics , liu tang , a 21-year-old , had arrived at the end of the sportsman &apos;s career .
liu jiaxuan &apos;s appearance made her quick to remember , and laid her foundation for the future of the entertainment circle .
after his retirement , liu made a series of tv dramas and set up his own studio in 2013 .
he took part in the two games of two games , two double-meter competition , and obtained two gold silver .
but after a 10-meter race in the 16-meter race in 2004 , he lost his team and was shot out of the diving team .
and he and his daughter took part in the &quot; daddy , &quot; he said , and he made his eyes full of eye .
once the golden generation of gymnastics , yang wei , li xiaopeng and chen an bing all participated in various variety shows .
it is worth mentioning that yang wei li , which led china to win the 2008 olympic champion of the 2008 olympic champion , was called full-win gold medals .
and chen &apos;s ice , while leading china to the olympic team champion in 2012 , has also become the king of the crane .
and after the london gold medal in the london olympics , chen 一冰 &apos;s generous move , also made him 圈粉 .
but the main energy of these athletes is still in the field , and it &apos;s just like a drab . it &apos;s just like a drab .
but whether retired or active athletes , it is necessary to get the rest of the entertainment circle to be guaranteed .
after all , athletes step into a new field , both in terms of competence or human veins , is a blank state .
even if it was a light , liu tang , the &quot; old man &quot; for many years , the ordinary audience brought them , more or more thought of their performance in the olympics .
and yang wei , li xiaobao and other new people , the introduction of the art show , all of them is the &quot; olympic champion . &quot;

the traditional methods of measurement usually use calcium-fed tissues , which can be used in some sharks , but this calcification is scarce in greenland .
the new study , led by julius nelson of the university of copenhagen in denmark , uses a greenland shark &apos;s eye lens for radiocarbon dating .
this method has previously been used to determine the age of whales , but for the first time it was used to determine the age of fish , such as sharks .

the researchers thus wrote in the paper that the greenland shark is the oldest known vertebrate species on the planet , over the previous long-lived champion orangutan whale ( 211 years old ) .

to play a leading role in urban and rural integration and full-domain tourism to accelerate the construction of feature-style small town , integrate tourism elements into each project and build tourism scenic spots in each country and town .

the committee secretary , zhang qi , deputy governor of the provincial council , wang road , deputy governor of the provincial government , is far from participating in research and talks .
deng yaping , who won 18 world championships in 14 years , became the first to win four gold medals in olympic history .
she maintained the world first in eight consecutive years , the world &apos;s longest female athlete in the history of table tennis .
on 26 september 2010 , the under-secretary-general for people &apos;s day and the general manager of the people &apos;s search network , general manager of the people &apos;s day search network , were senior officials .
recently , she will work together with miss denise yue to build the first innovative business industry innovation platform in the country .
on the sports side of china , there are also a group of star-studded coaches : the boundless beauty of the athlete &apos;s day , the countless glory it has won for the country , the years of lessons learned from years of learning and the creation of the champion .
as the first champion of the chinese men &apos;s gymnastics , huang yuanbin chose to pick up a whip .
from the coach coach to the coach , huang yuanbin has created a &quot; olympic gold group , &quot; and the team scored 9 gold and 4 bronze in the beijing olympic games .
since then , the light has been advertised and has played an important role in recent years .
many nba players have proved their strength , but there has been a decline in someone &apos;s progress .
there are a number of players who have regressed each season , either because of an age increase or a time limit on appearances .
of course , some of the &quot; step &quot; may be only the shrinking of data , and the strength of these players may not fall .
even though wade is still one of the best scoring guards in the league , his performance in the bulls should not be as good as the heat .
he has a limited range of rear field ranges , and there are only 32.8 per cent of the three-point ratio of home-star butler , which makes them very crowded for the next season .
arriving in the windy city , the lightning man is bound to give the ball more to butler and rondo , and he is likely to opt for a regimen in the regular season .
ole said the situation was embarrassing , as the first choice last season , and he had to play with simmons and the right to play in the new season .
the competition may not come soon , and simons needs to adapt to the nba , and 恩比德 will recover from the injury as soon as possible , but it is a problem for okafor to have a position in the 76 people .
in the last season , he scored 32 per cent of the score from low-level attacks , which was higher than cossus , vučević and brooke lópez , while his usage was also high in the previous 40 years .
as simmons has shown the excellent ball forward , earl &apos;s position is more suitable for the nba game .
in the last two seasons , thompson &apos;s use rate has stabilized at the top 20 of the league , and this is the best two seasons of his career .
the problem is , however , that , with the arrival of durant , thompson &apos;s usage would have declined , which would have implications for him .
this effect will be not only the impact of the number of shots , but also will be a significant reduction in the next season , which in some respects also reduces the difficulty for his opponent to defend him .
durant &apos;s arrival will make it possible for men players to shrink , but the most serious shrinkage is thompson .
but this does not mean that the level of 汤神 &apos;s level step , more like his sacrifice for the team as a whole .
parker showed better than the data in the last season , not only because his basket efficiency came to the top of his career , and his chemical reaction to aldridge also benefited the spurs .
duncan retired , and ginobili announced another year of war , and the combination of gdp eventually reached the end , as the youngest of the three people , the french sports car &apos;s tank was not much oil .
after the third championship ring , only jabbar , jordan and lazio have won more conventional mvp than james james , and jordan is the only fmvp more than james james .
oh , yes , james has just brought the first professional sports championship trophy for the past 52 years .
james in the 14th season of career , james needs a better guarantee of strength , ready to prepare for the playoffs .
so , in the regular season , james &apos;s data is likely to fall further , and he will share more burdens to owen , but he will still easily become the first three players in the league .
&quot; it must be in russia , &quot; he said .
local yellow , chairman of the russian federation of chinese overseas chinese , was thrilled to see the 中新网 reporter .
shortly before , she participated in a training course on chinese talent ( calligraphy , painting ) , hosted by the chinese state council of china , hosted by the state council of china , hosted by the state council of china .
in the course of the training course , he had no idea of where to come from , and after the course of the training course , it had been able to draw up and write his own work .
after returning to moscow , you must learn the knowledge and skills you have learned to make our own contribution to the spread and promotion of the chinese culture .

she said she had made great progress with the help of the training teachers , and had felt the burden of being &quot; overseas communicator of chinese culture . &quot;
那 said his return to f would spread and promote the chinese traditional culture among the chinese and the russians who love chinese culture .

the british team won gold medals in seven football games , and the fiji team won gold medals
the british team was unable to perform the outstanding performance before the front of the fiji team on thursday night , and was beaten by the fiji team in the dobo stadium in rio + 7 .
the fiji team won the gold medal with impeccable performance in control , breaking , avoiding , cooperating , running and power , which is the first olympic medal in the country .
the silver silver medal was a little consolation to the defeated british team , and the silver medal was the third silver medal that the british delegation had gained on the day : they beat new zealand , argentina and south africa on the first seven football games for the first time .
earlier this day , the british team was winning the south african south , which could have an impact on the status of the finals .
but in any case , the current fiji team is enough to defeat a spirit team .
at least one englishman will wear a gold medal tomorrow , but it may not be a comfort to the british team , but it may not be the british coach from winnion , the manager of the england team .
it is not easy for the british team to achieve today &apos;s achievements .
eight years ago , under ryan &apos;s teaching , they did not taste law in the 阿德莱得 international football game .
and now , they &apos;re just one step away from the championship .
while they have been dealt a huge blow , great strides have been made .
the opening of fiji &apos;s opening will be an advantage , making it impossible for the british team to take advantage of it .
in the case of tom mitchell and his teammate , this is like a series of running buses . the world &apos;s winning team has been ahead of five to 0 .
the game was just four minutes later , and jerry 图怀 scored a touchdown on the right wing .
at 12 to 0 , the british team hardly met the ball .
mitchell &apos;s strong interdiction has made a third score of lyon , a giant of the giant , but it merely slowed the pace of fiji &apos;s score .
in seven minutes , the british team was added to the right angle at the right angle .
the kalamawa got a minute , and the first half of the game was still one minute left .
and then , watt label broke through the team &apos;s defensive , direct score line .
the score was 29-0 .
the fijians seem to have been born to play 7 rugby , and the british team is still a cub .
this is the case .
the british team had made great changes in the second half and hit the fijian line in the second half , and the performance had been excellent for the first half . but after the first half , the team scored a second score .
dan norton , who created a scoring opportunity for the british team , changed the score to 36-7 in the left corner , but the game was in the hands of the south china sea island , where fans sang , waved flags , danced and danced .
the wonderful performance of the fiji team was compelling .
mata willian stopped a indifferent attack by the fiji team in the final moments .
at the end of the whistle , the fijian embrace , and the defeated british team will only regret to retreat .
earlier this day , the fiji team defeated the japanese team in the semi-final semi-finals , and britain was winning the south african team in a violent semi-finals .
in the first half , kyle brown helped africa lead , but dan norton scored with a good 的 in the second half .
after that , england &apos;s anthony watson &apos;s brother , marcus watson , secured the team &apos;s victory with excellent interception and eventually the british team won the silver medal .
helen graf and heather steinberg are encouraged by cancer-related coaches to win the gold medal
there is no exaggeration to say that this is the most moved gold medal .
from the first oar to now , helen graf and heather steiningen have accepted the 220 punitive pull-up training , and they have more extraordinary significance in the gold medal in estacio da lagoa .
although they were the only two to paddle , there was a man on board , coach robin williams , who had been with them for the second consecutive women &apos;s double sculls olympic gold medal , the uk &apos;s first rowing women &apos;s team to reach that height .
they have maintained a 39-game unbeaten streak and have an absolute advantage .
what we see is the grace of the two gifted athletes on the water , but this is not the whole of this victory .
there are many voluntary help behind each of the gold medals , and it is their constant dedication to create a difference , and one of them is to learn about their own cancer , not knowing whether or not they are alive to see the day &apos;s coach .
as he said , death could come .
i got a bladder cancer , and they operated for me .
if the surgery is not done , the cancer cells are 扩撒 to the whole body .
in that way , the situation would be too bad .
it will change your opinion a little .
williams was diagnosed with cancer in december 2013 .
fortunately , he began treatment in early 2014 , minimizing the impact , although that may not be appropriate in this case .
i need my salary , so i have to hurry up .
this is an incentive for me .
i live in the hospital , though they say it was enough , but i was walking around 20 feet , 30 feet and 50 feet in the ward .
this is the starting point of everything .
the racing movement itself is a journey , which makes this journey longer .
at the moment of gold , the first thing they thought of was williams , who was a little more talkative this morning than usual , to overcome his anxiety .
&quot; i &apos;m not in a bad mood this week , but the gold medal is really extraordinary , &quot; she said . &quot; i &apos;m in a bad mood this week , &quot; she said .
it repeatedly told me how important it was to me , and how hard it was for me , helen , and robin .
this is helen , robin and i have worked hard for three years .
if there is no robin , we &apos;re just a nobody , thank him very much . he &apos;s the best coach in the world .
i &apos;m not likely to find a better trainer and coach than him .
helen graf and heather steiningen did not taste the defeat in five years .
the penalties imposed on the combination are not comparable to their opponents .
even in the last 500 metres in the end of the last 500 metres , the new zealand team and the danish team are beginning to close , stanning and graf still have plenty of physical reserves .
it was amazing at that time .
helen cried , &quot; keep pace and keep pace . &quot;
it is indeed important not to be affected by opponents .
we have a good start , and we are not looking forward to doing something earth-shattering .
we &apos;re not going to think of the glory of today , but we just want to think about each oar and win the game , and we can do it .
it took a year to determine its own future .
graf will be married next month with steve buck , a television explorer .
but now she wants to enjoy the moment .
i don &apos;t want to say that &apos;s my last game .
this will bring me too much pressure .
in london , i spent about six months to realize that i was the olympic champion .
this is a new experience , and i feel very nervous .
it has been about four minutes now .
she said , &quot; i feel better . &quot;

the &quot; animation &quot; effect of snapchat was referred to the irony of the asian people
while snapchat indicates that this filter is inspired by animation , but some observers think it has ethnic colors .
snapchat &apos;s 150 million daily users can change reality through their filter tools and make people seem funny .
you can turn yourself into a pineapple , a dog or a role painting .
these lenses have the effect of passivation and bending characteristics , which produces more than 3,000 copies each day .
any error will be brought to the attention of the public at once .
the sapchat lens has been criticized , which is used to motivate black or white skin for beauty .
so , when the application this week provides some users with a filter that can create 斜眼 , 怪牙 and face effects , some critics call it racial satire on the &quot; yellow race &quot; in asia .
they even think that these recurring problems mean that the company has a larger problem in its diversity .
on wednesday the vergeand motherboard report on wednesday the verge and motherboard report sparked public anger after the deletion of the function .
the company &apos;s explanation is that the filter is to pay homage to animators , not satirical asians .
but for observers who have experienced racism , the filter reminds them of the harmful stereotypes of reality .
others are strongly opposed to these animation images .
in an e-mail message from a korean-american art that has published twitter and widely shared with these photos , &quot; these filters &quot; are &quot; at least uncomfortable and uncomfortable &quot; in an e-mail .
she also said : &quot; it is difficult to distinguish the effects of an extremely sick asian satirical image and filter . &quot;
although the filter mirror is not only a yellow species , the yellow species are extremely deft .
snapchat isn &apos;t the only company that touches the bottom line of these cultures .
american culture seems to be promoting diversity and inclusiveness from the board of directors to hollywood and the equipment we carry .
snapchat &apos;s large young group may be very sensitive because of a greater focus on racial diversity than the older generation .
when a filter produced an insult to the user &apos;s image , juba , 25 , said in an interview thursday : &quot; it is more difficult to escape from people than before . &quot;
on thursday , ms. zhu , who served as a product manager and engineer , decided to delete her sánchez account and encourage others to do so .
in an interview with the written articles and a telephone interview , she said she thought that race-related disputes reflected the lack of ethnic diversity in the recruitment process .
ms. zhu criticism that the company &apos;s employees are mostly white , the leadership is all men and a label is added at the end of the article : # deletesnapchat .
as a chinese-american , ms. zhu said , &quot; or they have no colour in their employees , so they can make such decisions , or some of their employees , but their positions do not allow them to speak freely . &quot;
other observers shared complaints that she had not been responded to by snapchat .
the company did not publish data on the diversity of staff and said that he was a private company .
snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic background of his employees on thursday , but a spokesman said the company had recently hired a recruiter to pay attention to the more population and to promote internal inclusiveness .
ms. zhu said she would close her sánchez account : &quot; i want to know if they need more users like us . &quot;
the congressional panel said military officials had distorted the intelligence of isis
in a report released thursday , a congressional panel noted that officials of the us central command changed intelligence reports and described the war against the islamic state in iraq and syria as more optimistic than the actual situation .
the midterm report came from an ad hoc working group set up by the house armed services committee , the intelligence committee and the chairman of the house appropriations committee &apos;s national defense division republican party that said there was &quot; widespread dissatisfaction &quot; among the central command intelligence analysts who said superiors were tampering with their assessments of the u.s. war with the islamic state .
the central command ( centcom ) , located in tampa , florida , is the military headquarters responsible for overseeing united states military operations in the middle east and central asia .
according to a news report on the report , &quot; intelligence informed by the senior leadership of the central command is more optimistic than the actual situation in the united states and has always been more optimistic than the analysis of other intelligence agencies . &quot;
the republican representative of california said : &quot; the conduct of the central command is difficult to accept . on the other hand , our fighters are suffering from war , and the other side is the wrong analysis of senior policymakers .
the leadership of the central command has been extended to the highest level of the institution .
the report detailed a long-standing issue in 2014 and 2015 between central command in describing and analysing the u.s. training of iraqi forces .
while there is no deterministic evidence that the senior officials of the obama administration have ordered the change of these reports , these analysts feel themselves under pressure from central command leaders , forcing them to make more optimistic views on the threat of islamic countries ( isis ) .
in the first half of 2015 , the report states that &quot; in the first half of 2015 , many central command press releases , statements and congressional testimony are more optimistic than actual circumstances . &quot;
for example , a central command official has publicly indicated that a major military operation could be taken back to mosul in april or may 2015 .
iraq &apos;s second largest city , mosul , is still under the control of the islamic state .
&quot; after months of investigations , the results have been very clear , &quot; said mike ponpeo , a republican on the state of kansas , in a statement .
since mid-2014 to mid-2015 , most of the us central command &apos;s top intelligence officers have manipulated the command &apos;s intelligence products to conceal the threat from isis .
the republicans have set up a dedicated working group after being manipulated from analysts to know that the intelligence of the islamic state was manipulated .
as the investigation continues , there will be more discoveries following the report released on thursday .
the attorney general of the ministry of defence also conducted a long-term survey of the central command .
the democratic members of the house intelligence committee released their findings on thursday , in line with some of the conclusions of the republican task force .
in a statement , the democratic leader of the committee , on behalf of the democratic leader of the committee , said in a statement that the central command developed a too narrow process for intelligence assessment of isil and iraqi peacekeeping forces during the period 2014-2015 . &quot;
&quot; the process &quot; interferes with the release of intelligence , and has reduced the morale of the analyst and &quot; unable to accept different opinions , &quot; mr. said .
but mr xieandar and democrats also say they have found no evidence that the white house is trying to pressure analysts at the central command , so that their conclusions fit &quot; default or political narratives . &quot;
the beast daily reported the preliminary results of congress investigations on tuesday .
in august last year , the new york times reported that the attorney general of the pentagon began to investigate after receiving complaints from central command analysts .
a spokesman for the pentagon spokesman , patrick evans , said in a statement that the ministry of defence did not comment on this congressional report before the prosecutor general &apos;s investigation was closed .
but he said , &quot; experts sometimes divide differences in the interpretation of complex data , while intelligence agencies and the ministry of defense encourage a healthy dialogue on these important national security themes . &quot;
the impact of the investigation has gone beyond the question of whether the us-led bombing campaign in iraq and syria has been successful , as more defense officials claim .
in last year , however , these claims brought the public to question the extent to which president obama could trust the military operations in iraq , afghanistan , libya and other crisis areas released by the central command .
the criticism of the islamic state &apos;s intelligence was reminiscent of a more than 10 years ago , when the central command intelligence analyst , greg dahuk , wrote a study stating that george w. bush &apos;s government , despite opposition from a large number of analysts , insisted on sending small-scale troops to iraq and almost did not consider the situation following the 2003 invasion .
mr. dahuk played a key role in the opposition campaign on the intelligence of the islamic state .
last year , officials said that mr. dahuk &apos;s team had concluded that air strikes against the islamic state refinery did not substantially reduce the economic earnings of terrorist organizations , since the terrorist organization had built an interim oil refinery to continue selling oil on the black market , unlike the announced statement .
according to the september report of the times , the central command has not published this discovery .
when a number of lawyers examined the senate testimony about an overly optimistic assessment of the war , the commander of the central command , lloyd austin iii , was criticized last year .
in april , general austen was retired in april and is currently being replaced by joseph walter in the position of the central command .
the united states won four victories in the women &apos;s tennis match and will match with britain
katie bam , a three in the 6 victory over japan , helped the american team to win a 3 victory for the american women &apos;s hockey team on thursday .
five goals in two games were four , but bam , 27 , said she didn &apos;t know she was doing so well .
&quot; i don &apos;t know anything about that , &quot; she said .
i &apos;m not that kind of person who will remember myself in a few balls .
she knew that the united states had won four victories in the olympic games and would compete with the team in the first place in the team after winning the japanese team on thursday at 2-0 .
britain and the united states met in the last match of the first game on saturday .
both teams made their way to the quarterfinals , which will determine who will emerge as the team &apos;s first .
the team first team will be able to avoid a strong dutch team , so we can walk farther . the dutch team is out of line first in another group .
in the game on saturday , the united states created a miracle in an astonishing performance , knowing that the united states had put the floor in the 12 teams four years ago .
bartham was also in the team at that time .
growth grew up in whelped , pennsylvania , and first picked up a hockey stick ( her twin sister in 德雷克塞尔 ) at the age of 3 and joined the national team at the age of 16 , becoming the youngest member of the national team to date .
she missed the 2008 olympic games due to the failure of the final list .
in 2012 , she and her teammates were all right .
the next year , the british , craig parham , took the job as head coach and everything began to change .
&quot; this is a change in culture , mentality and substance , &quot; he said .
we haven &apos;t reached the current level in london at that time .
we came up to the bottom of the bottom .
on thursday night , bynum was shot first in the first half in front of a close counter-hand shot .
india &apos;s success in this competition is still not good , but this team has shown an amazing tenacity and keeps a 1-0 score to the end of section iii , when bartham broke out .
she took the ball on the left side of the court , and then went to the middle of the road and shot the net , and the united states team was in the lead .
梅利萨 gonzalez launched the final goal in the middle of the fourth quarter .
in the first three victories in the first three victories , the united states was playing a ball in the first three victories in the first three victories .
this time she was super-standing .
bartham is also the same .
&quot; we have a good state right now , but how much better will depend on the outcome of the saturday game .
poor food in the great depression of the great depression
in march 1933 , franklin delano roosevelt , elected president of the president , was sitting in the presidential office for lunch .
as a foodie , president roosevelt loved the fifth avenue cuisine , such as foie gras and maryland braised water fish .
on that day , his menu was simple : ketchup devil eggs , mashed potatoes , and fruit pudding as a snack .
&quot; it is for people who are suffering from suffering and suffering from suffering , &quot; jane zman said .
her husband andrew koroma added : &quot; it also reflects the way americans eat . &quot;
the couple , who live in the brooklyn highlands , are food historians .
in the first book , mr. krugman &apos;s last book on the united states was a chinese food , and ms. zizman told the life story of the slum-tenants by food in her 97 orchard .
the new book , written by their co-writers , will be published on tuesday by harper publishing house , which is the american food history in the great depression .
they met a reporter in the sandwich shop in adberg &apos;s sandwich shop after displaying some of the common insights on food , and the simple lunch counter of the iron-fighting area has been operating since the 1929 economy .
ms. 齐格曼 , 54 , ordered a cream olive sandwich , while mr. kfor , 57 , ordered a turkey , mashed potato and a vegetable dish .
the reporter points out a piece of baking meat , which is suitable for the couple to think that these dishes are suitable for a diet during the great depression .
&quot; the bread was very popular , &quot; said ms. qigman .
there was peanut bread , liver bread , soy bread at the time .
they both use a raw material and a cheap feed on the raw material .
imagine your dinner is peanut .
mr. ko made a face .
&quot; they must be like lead in your stomach , &quot; he said .
in the past few years before the great depression , the united states has been a buffet , especially in the suburbs .
a group of women are cooking , breakfast , lunch and dinner for male farm workers .
in world war i , it was the americans who gave food to the hungry europeans , which recorded how the country suddenly ceased to be a place of prosperity .
mr. koko explained why he and his wife had to write the book : &quot; at that time , food had become a major topic for the americans . &quot;
another unhappy topic is the new foods such as cold acids : bread and stew , such as &quot; craftsmanship , &quot; said ms. zman , because the chef could use the cream in the sauce to cover the uneaten raw materials .
fresh fruits are replaced by cheap dried fruits .
it has been a rare luxury in the united states for years to serve as a leading role in the american dining table .
the strange hodgepodge only takes into account calories , and people are the first to think about nutrition than the taste , even the basic culinary sense .
during the study of this book , including various recipes , ms. 齐格曼 produced a roast onion stuffed with peanut oil .
&quot; the dinner table is not common in the dinner table , &quot; he said .
&quot; it &apos;s too strange , &quot; ms. zman said .
the peanut oil is no match with baking onions .
this is the characteristic of many families .
family economists have influenced the country &apos;s eating habits , such as louis stanley , who was a chef at the federal department of family economics from 1923 to 1943 , which is unique in history .
they published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , and they encouraged women to &quot; lean &quot; and be brave enough to turn to a bad food like carrot and carrot .
&quot; the big meal &quot; is a rich &quot; flavor of history . &quot;
it is especially noteworthy that the government &apos;s response to the hungry people , such as the president of the president , herbert hoover , &quot; i can &apos;t mind . &quot;
while he publicly praised the simple love of the farmhouse in iowa , his diet was just as delicate as a millionaire .
&quot; he likes to eat european western food , such as fish 伴 , &quot; mr. kfor said .
he wore an evening gown to eat in a gilded dining room .
he was clearly separated from the people .
if her wife , eleanor , encouraged him to set an example in his diet , president roosevelt might have made the same mistake .
as the book says , ms roosevelt hired the housekeeper to taste without interest , and the white house &quot; food is not only the most difficult food in washington , but the worst food . &quot;
when the united states came back to being formal , many times of the great depression were abandoned .
ms. zman said that what was left was our concern about calories and nutrition and the application of science to cooking .
in writing this book , the couple learned to learn more about the eating habits of ms. zman &apos;s mother , such as how she did not discard the food .
&quot; she is very afraid of wasting food , &quot; mr. kfor said .
&quot; she actually made a lot of people sick , &quot; ms. zman recalled .
for example , there had been a &quot; cream bubble &quot; event .
after removing the dishes , she and mr. kfor took out a dessert they had prepared at home : this was the fruit pudding that president roosevelt ate during his lunch .
&quot; this is called the cream , &quot; said ms. zman , &quot; and adding that the name of a new tide for a common dish is &quot; idiopathic tricks . &quot;
there is no cream in this dessert , only a fruit , a little flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
all of us will make it difficult for all of us to keep the spoon in depth in the thick brown paste .
the unexpected is that the taste of the sweetener is not good .
mr. kfor ate the second spoon and the third spoon .
he thought it was an acceptable practical dessert , and told his wife , &quot; it would be better to add some crushed walnuts . &quot;
unfortunately , opec &apos;s latest monthly report showed crude oil production continued to rise in july , with saudi production even more at record highs .
the report raises doubts about the credibility of opec , and the road to oil recovery is still 布满 .
on monday , the president of opec and the qatar energy minister , posada posada , said that opec would hold an informal meeting during the international energy forum on 26 - 28 september .
opec &apos;s monthly report released wednesday , including gabon , rose 4.6 million barrels a day / day to 3311 million barrels per day , according to the monthly report released on wednesday .
opec also said in december that the low price of crude oil had prompted the global refinery to produce more refined oils , thereby adding to the extent of the market &apos;s supply of surplus .
international oil prices fell for two consecutive days as a result of the news , combined with an increase in u.s. crude oil production expectations and an unexpected rise in crude oil inventories .
the crude oil futures price fell 2.48 % in september , down 2.48 % in october , and the london brent price fell 2.07 % in october , as at last wednesday .
according to reuters , it is unlikely that the proposed meeting of oil-producing countries would be less likely to tighten the supply , and the data published by the united states energy information department also depress market sentiment .
iran &apos;s official news agency , the fars , quoted iranian oil minister gonzaga on wednesday as saying iran &apos;s crude oil production is at a maximum of 3.85 million barrels a day , the highest level since 2008 .
the news of the meeting came just as russian energy minister bernard novak said there was no need for a new round of freeze talks under the current oil price .
the last meeting of the last oil-producing countries had been in april , and the opec member states failed to reach agreement on any measure .
the market and the media are likely to be overly responsive to opec &apos;s conference response , said richardson richardson , an oil and gas analyst at bmir .
mr croft croft , the chief of commodity strategy of the royal bank of canada , said opec would change the market &apos;s mood by releasing the signal that they would lead to an agreement .
the tool is like a mist of smoke and a mirror ( deliberately giving the wrong impression ) .
mr wen weinberg , director of the german commercial bank &apos;s commodity research , said opec was thinking that opec was trying to stabilize the market by september .
it is likely to further undermine the market &apos;s confidence in opec , after all , the organization has performed a &quot; wolf . &quot;
the number of medical institutions that are subject to violations of medical advertisements , complaints of complaints , and multiple punishments are subject to a spot examination .
the national health insurance board , the national medical administration of china and the national drug administration will supervise the supervision and inspection of special supervision checks in part of the province .
according to the media , as a result of the massive influx of capital into the internet medicine , the problem of the current product homogenization is serious , the investment boom is receding , the capital into the outlook period .
in addition , according to the hong kong international hospital management research center data , internet health companies in the year of entrepreneurship have died in large numbers and about 20 per cent of start-up internet health enterprises have ceased to exist .
however , while most of the internet-based medical firms struggled on the way of the acd or bam , several segments of the leading companies were still able to obtain capital heat .
it seems that internet-based medical start-ups cannot be &quot; a beehive , &quot; but rather to look at the market demands and have a deep heart to do so .
the fish jumped $ 1,200.00 million , accounting for 40 per cent of the registered capital , and nine state-owned equipment invested $ 180 million , representing 60 per cent of the registered capital .
in recent years , with the policy support of the state in the area of medical information , the electronic and integrated supply chain management system has gradually entered the various levels of hospital .
the co-operation between the fish and nine states is aimed at market demand , helping hospitals build up the advanced supply chain management system and serve as an opportunity to seek more cooperation .
unlike many internet-based medical companies , the ivodship was initially focused on the vertical vertical area of the internet , with a deep ploughing mother and a doctor at both ends .
the expectant mother is not only a 24-hour and one-to-one doctor to ask for a doctor &apos;s visit , but also a pay-oriented doctor .
at the doctor &apos;s end , ibaby breaks territorial limits by organizing expert seminars for grass-roots doctors on online lectures , peer exchanges , case discussions , and so on .
at present , there are three plates open to doctors , doctors , doctors , and doctors .
provide online learning , case discussion , academic exchange ; social platforms with hospitals , with the doctors and doctors ; legal aid and entrepreneurial support required for doctor-patient relationships or personal life .
according to media reports , ceo wang lei has recently said ali &apos;s health is &quot; willing to &quot; take the health big data .
internet companies , data companies lack professionalism and are not uniform in writing methods on the same word .
ali &apos;s layout in the area of medical health is divided into three blocks , namely , ali &apos;s health , the sky medicine library and the future hospital .
wang lei said that health-health entrepreneurship would be harder than any other industry , &quot; it was not just a lot of money , but it would have to be in the heart of loneliness and slow to do . &quot;

later , he summarized the information provided by the aeronautical meteorological service of the united states air force and submitted a detailed report .

hillary clinton released its 2105 tax declaration on friday and declared the democratic presidential candidate and her husband &apos;s earnings of $ 1,075 million for 2015 and 34.2 per cent of federal taxes .
in 2015 , the clinton couple &apos;s charitable contributions amounted to $ 1 million , most of them to the clinton foundation ; former president bill clinton had reached nearly $ 5.3 million , while the former secretary of state earned $ 3 million from publisher simon and schuster , with a book on her tenure in the state council .
clinton &apos;s campaign partner , senator tim kane , and his wife , anne holton , announced a 10-year tax declaration .
they paid 20.3 per cent of federal taxes in 2015 .
hillary clinton and tim kane will continue to be a benchmark for financial transparency , clinton &apos;s campaign aide jennifer par said in a statement .
in stark contrast to it , donald trump has made false reasons to cover up and recover the promise of the declaration of the tax declaration made before him .
although the law does not require , the presidential candidates of the united states should disclose their tax declaration in accordance with established practice .
as a new york businessman , trump and his lawyers would justify the tax declaration of the united states treasury department as a reason for refusing to publish the tax declaration .
bill clinton &apos;s campaign assistant , ian savage , said to you that you are the lord , and attach a link to the declaration of the party &apos;s tax declaration .
on thursday , trump &apos;s special counsel , michael cohen , told cnn that he would not allow trump to release his tax returns until the audit is complete .
critics of trump , including republican presidential candidates mitt romney and other republicans , said trump &apos;s refusal to publish the tax declaration would trigger questions about its net worth , charity contributions , commercial transactions and various other relationships , including relations with russia .
bill clinton caught the issue violently and released a web video on friday , highlighting high-profile democrats urging trump to publish his taxes .
on thursday , she raised the issue in a speech speech in michigan .
&quot; for decades , he refused to release his tax returns like any other presidential candidate , &quot; she told the crowd .
the new york times business columnist quoted several tax lawyers and accountants on friday , according to cnn news , and the new york times business columnist quoted several tax lawyers and accountants on friday that the current situation might still be so .
the federal tax has become a major problem in the presidential campaign .
bill clinton &apos;s name , warren buffett , named a million-million investment home , named a provision guaranteeing at least 30 per cent of taxes to be paid for people who earn more than $ 1 million .
president obama also supported the proposal .
last week , clinton held a rally in omaha , nebraska , at berkshire hathaway , where mr. buffett asked trump to meet and exchange tax returns .
buffett says he is also receiving irs audits , trump &apos;s &quot; fear &quot; is not tax authorities , but voters .
the first tax declaration of the clinton campaign was published in 2007 as the first tax declaration published by the clinton campaign .
the average federal rate paid by the clintons , who currently reside in charker , new york , was about 32 percent of the average federal tax rate paid between 2007 and 2014 , with a combined tax rate of about 40.5 percent .
the bill clinton &apos;s tax declaration in 2015 shows that , unlike most americans , their wages are only $ 100 .
their main investment is the low-cost index mutual fund , and the clintons pay dividends and interest income of $ 109,000 .

jewish filmmaker criticises berlin hotel for removing israeli phone code in line with arab clients - reuters news
a french filmmaker with jewish roots told the media that the kettinsky hotel in berlin did not list israel &apos;s phone code , and hotel employees said it was in line with arab clients &quot; demands , prompting an uproar .
claude langman , the author of the holocaust documentary on the holocaust , expressed his disappointment at the quinn hotel and an open letter was published in the frankfurt report of germany .
lanzmann wants to find israel on the telephone code list provided by the hotel during the most recent stay .
however , israel does not have a list of countries that can direct the room directly from the room .
did israel disappear in the german capital , berlin , in 2016 ?
朗兹曼 wrote .
instead , the guests can call the israeli telephone at the call center of the quinn hotel .
in order to find an explanation , the filmmaker asked the hotel front desk .
in the letter , lanzman said in his letter he was shocked by the answer to the front desk .
the hotel personnel said it was a deliberate decision in the hotel management .
the reason for doing so is to make the film producer angry .
lanzmann quoted the employee &apos;s original words : most of our guests were arabs and they asked to delete israel &apos;s code . &quot;
according to the rio daily , the israeli ambassador to germany , yakov ardas handerman , described the incident as &quot; an insult . &quot;
we were surprised to learn of the incident .
it is a great disgrace to the matter itself .
and it happened in germany and that chain of chains .
there is no need to explain the matter .
&quot; we want the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; the official said .
the incident sparked a heated debate on the internet , and all of us thought it was a scandal .
it was thought that the quinn hotel was simply to meet the demands of the arab clients .
another post pointed directly to the hotel &apos;s &quot; real donald , &quot; and pointed out that the street , which is located on the famous bank of culpeam , was near a synagogue .
it was reported that the hotel soon clarified all allegations and claimed that everything was &quot; negligence &quot; and said &quot; apologies &quot; to lanzmann .
the daily nande quoted kempinski as saying : &quot; there has never been a direct order to remove israel from the fast dial list . &quot;
the paper also said that the israeli code had been added to the list .

scotland own 卡尔姆 won the gold medal after winning the gold medal
scotland 卡尔姆卡尔姆 skinner success last
the 23-year-old glasgow bicycle was replaced by sir chris hawk , the 23-year-old glasgow cyclist , and became proud to be the legendary bicycle player when the young spitz defeated the winning team and the reputation of the winning team .
four years ago , the british team was astonished , and hawking had won the fifth gold medal in the six olympic gold medals .
the british team was ranked sixth in the world &apos;s cycling tournament in march in march , and the british team became brilliant .
during the beijing olympic games to the london games , the british team &apos;s question was to change the &quot; first circle of experts , jamie starff . &quot;
the convoy was doing so only when he appeared .
hoy &apos;s retirement left a gap , and and matt cranpton wanted to fill the void .
after seeing skinner &apos;s potential , the team of british men insisted that he would be selected for the national team , and skinner eventually lived .
the skinner &apos;s partner was winning gold medals four years ago with hogwarts and kenny kenney , who had updated the olympic record in the qualifying period , but the result was transcending the first round of the team .
and the three british cyclists eventually beat their opponents and won gold medals .
although he had a little lag behind the team , kenny led the team ahead , and skinner took this leading edge to the end .
the change of strategy is the key to the reversal of this reversal , and sant chose the larger flywheel , so it was slow at a slower pace , and that would allow kenney to keep pace .
hawking watched the game with the bbc commentator , and skinner , kenny and sickle saw him at the podium .
this skinner , 23 , said : &quot; this makes me feel flattered . &quot;
i &apos;m just doing what i can to make a name for myself .
we created the olympic record in the finals and beat the world champion .
this is unbelievable .
nothing is better than this victory .
after winning the gold medal with kenny and hoy at the london games in 2012 , 辛德斯 admitted that he was deliberately down on the track in a bad start .
later , he withdrew the comments , and the british team &apos;s opponents were unable to appeal .
there is no such problem for this victory .
&quot; it &apos;s like the british flag on the platform , &quot; he said .
we just arrived at the team three months ago .
we have lost a lot of world champions , so it &apos;s amazing to be able to defend the olympic title .
it was only a game and a gold medal for the seven british teams that won the 10 gold medals in the beijing olympic games and the london games .
if this represents the progress we have made in the last five months , we will continue to succeed in the bicycle hall in the next five days .
according to kenny &apos;s performance , he was not unlikely to recreate the feat of winning three gold medals at an olympics .
if it was so , the day of younger 12 years younger than hogwarts and the same day in the british sports community , steve reid and roger fedare would have six gold medals and one silver medal in this day .
that achievement was at the same level as hogwarts .
kenny will go on to compete in the three-day race to start today .
&quot; i &apos;m going to focus on the game , &quot; said the 28-year-old bolton .
the team race has always been the best .
you can win the game with your teammates .
frankly speaking , a person wins a little lonely .
&quot; if he wins two other gold medals , he should be awarded a knighthood , &quot; he said .
it was the only match of the day that produced a medal , but the british team received other good news .
bradley sir wiggins , ed clancy , steven burke and owen doerr advanced to a four-man four-kilometre race with the fastest results .
their grades are 351.943 .
the world record for the 2012 london olympic gold medal winner is 351.659 .
the first round and the finals ( at 10 : 42 pm ) were held in the second world cup today , and willis will undoubtedly become a focal point .
he had a dispute with the competition officer yesterday , when the competition officer told him to measure his height .
in the women &apos;s team competition , which ends tomorrow , laura trott , joanna rotherell shander , elinor barker and kate archibald from milehead have set a new world record of 413.260 .
the british team relied heavily on its own site to ride on its own site in the middle of the games and won more than a number of medals .
after showing its absolute dominance at the beijing and london games , the british bicycle team was a little disappointed in the process of going to rio .
during the period , many waves were held , including the resignation of sean savton , director of the april technical director , who resigned as a result of gender-based discrimination and bullying , as well as the retirement of hawk , victoria penetrton .
but the first game of the bicycle hall is enough to prove that the british team will come up again at the moment of peak state .

the individual &apos;s resistance to self-exposure and its emotional experience is designed to prevent self-awareness and self-esteem of the individual .
some behaviorism psychologists understand the impedance as an individual &apos;s disobedience to his behavior correction .
i tried to get amy to do an exercise to calm herself down through breathing , to feel the agony .
once she left the situation situation , she felt relaxed and regained her freedom .

today , the head of the enterprise coordination division of the national development reform commission has pointed out today that the excess capacity of steel is a global problem .
the capacity utilization rate in our country has been higher in recent years than the global average and is higher than the countries and regions of the united states .
our country has taken resolute and effective measures to resolve excess capacity , and its effectiveness is gradually emerging .
according to the director , the central state council attaches great importance to the global problem of excess steel capacity .
departments and regions are actively involved in the implementation of the state council and carry out their work seriously and will reduce rough steel capacity of around 4,500 tonnes this year .
in view of china &apos;s national conditions , china does not encourage the export of steel ; on the contrary , a series of practical measures are taken to control the export of steel .
the chief stressed that the nature of international trade in steel products was essentially market behaviour , and the choice of self-choice was due to the demand of importing countries , the integration of consumers into consideration of the value for money .
the implementation of trade protection measures does not contribute to a fundamental solution to the development problems of the global steel industry and , on the contrary , will only have a further impact on the international trade order .
when it comes to debt , the officer-in-charge stressed that resolving the debt problem is an important issue that needs to be properly addressed in the process of eliminating excess capacity .
because of the large scale of the assets of the steel enterprises , the debt relationship of some enterprises is complicated and can lead to regional risk .
according to the director , in recent years , with the downward pressure on the economy , social aggregate demand has been gradually weakened , with a decline in productivity utilization in some sectors and increased productivity in enterprises .
some enterprises do not adapt to the changes in the market environment , and production is difficult to fail even on the verge of collapse , but by some institutional mechanisms constraints , more barriers to market-oriented exit have become a &quot; zombie enterprise . &quot;
the existence of such enterprises distorts market signals , reduces the efficiency of the utilization of factor resources , increases the cost of social management and hinders the establishment of a fair competition market environment .
the main causes of the loss are the same as the plight of the global steel industry - market demand and low capacity utilization .
in our country , market-based mechanisms , economic instruments and the rule of law approach are mainly taken by the government , mainly in the pursuit of social stability and social stability , and ensuring a fair and fair market order .
the leader stressed that the next step is to continue to work on the 去产能 work and to ensure that five years of the goal of resolve 1 million tons of steel capacity will be completed .
on the afternoon of the 10th afternoon , the chinese tourist police appeared in the red square in moscow , and the chinese tourists waved with surprise , and locals and foreign tourists stopped to look back .

on the same day , the chinese tourist police also shared their russian counterparts on the tour of the city tour police brigade in the city of moscow .
&quot; i used to deal with chinese tourists , and i was very happy to see them come to russia . &quot;
&quot; the question they usually turn to : how the road goes , where a monument is , how to rent it , and how to get back to the hotel . &quot;
in recent years , the urban environment and tourism atmosphere in moscow has become better and more attractive to foreign tourists .
in response to the need for tourism development , a tourist police force was established in july 2014 to assist and channel visitors on patrols in various attractions .
at present , all the moscow travel police are proficient in english , in part in spanish and german .
the police brigade divided them into nine teams on the basis of the level of foreign language and twice a week to learn in self-defence , laws and regulations and foreign languages .

as a young european player , a lot of fans told him not to know , but it was impressed by the performance of surrey &apos;s performance through the olympic games .

the future of portland smelter is fraught with uncertainty as a result of the cancellation of the power contract
due to the fact that a factory owner will terminate a supply contract for all of the factory owners due to the fact that a factory owner will terminate a supply contract so that all supply contracts fail , and hundreds of workers are currently facing uncertain future .
the initiative took place following the decision of the victorian government to continue to release subsidies that guarantee the operation of the factory .
the fixed subsidy for 20 years will be terminated in november .
2000 workers in the portland factory in alcoa may face unemployment .
once the factory closes , up to 2,000 people may be directly or indirectly unemployed .
and because the plant &apos;s electricity consumption accounts for about 10 % of victoria &apos;s total power output , it may also have a ripple effect .
in 2014 , the aluminum company closed the hanriel smelter in 2014 , which led to the closure of the power plant in guernsey last year .
portland smelter smelters are currently losing their losses and are at risk of closing .
the move was followed by a forecast for the coming years of the factory and the initial reason was that the dollar was stronger than the price of the factory product .
the agl provides electricity to the large aluminum smelter through the old elvin power station in the montserrat valley . the company predicts that three other factory owners will also terminate their agreements .
the largest shareholder in the factory is a joint venture with aluminium companies and alumina companies , while china &apos;s china-china-china-china-china-china-china-china-china-based club and japan have a small share of shares .
&quot; agl is expected to continue to operate , &quot; said the joint venture , which means that the smelter will continue to produce electricity demand . &quot;
agl stated that these contracts were &quot; hedge contracts &quot; that should have entered into force since november 2016 .
the termination of the contract is 12 months , so they will be terminated in 2017 .
&quot; therefore , agl continues to predict that these contracts will continue to generate revenue in the fiscal year 2017 . &quot;
any income effect that the agl might have had since the fiscal year 2018 is now subject to an optimistic outlook for the wholesale price of wholesale prices .
the agl stated that the value of the contract had been reduced by the company in terms of &quot; termination activities &quot; and the value of the contract value of $ 1.87 million .
the aluminium company said the decision to terminate these contracts would not affect the ability of aluminium companies to operate the smelter or to guarantee the power supply of the smelter . &quot;
the united states company stated that it had signed a 20-year contract with lao yang in 2010 , which would have entered into force in november this year , but the company did not explain why the contract was withdrawn .
analysts are cautious about whether the portland smelter in victoria and the 托马戈 plant near newcastle will be closed because of the bad economic situation in the industry .
in response to comments from analysts earlier this week , agl operations chief michelsen said the annual electricity use in portland amounted to about 600 megawatts and the tomo plant reached about 900 megawatts .
if the two factories are closed , the demand for the power market will be significantly reduced .
&quot; as a power company , it is not a good news for us , &quot; he said .
the community law centre excludes 160,000 people each year
each year , more than 160,000 the most vulnerable groups are excluded from the community law centre . this service is already overstretched and is now facing further funding cuts .
in queensland , three out of every five people were denied access to free legal advice and representation , most of them elderly people , immigrants , vulnerable workers , victims of violence and lack of resources to counter unfair evictions .
the lack of funding for community legal services has already exceeded limits , and further financial cuts are now being faced .
the federal government &apos;s funding for these legal centres will be reduced by 30 % since june next year .
james farrell , head of the queensland community law center , said thousands of people were excluded every year , according to the latest national community association law centre .
mr. farrell said the situation would only be worse if the federal government did not change the existing decision .
&quot; there is a long-term shortage of funding for community legal centres in queensland , &quot; he said , which means that thousands will not be able to obtain the important services they need . &quot;
people who need to stay out of violence , those saddled with huge debts that cannot be repaid , families facing fragmentation , squeezed workers , these populations all face legal problems , and the report shows that they do not have the help they need .
the federal government will cut a 30 per cent reduction since june 2017 , meaning that thousands of vulnerable groups in queensland will be forced to deal with complex legal issues in the absence of assistance .
we call upon the minister of justice and the queensland councillor of queensland , george brin , to withdraw the decision on these cuts , so that people can obtain the help they need in the face of legal issues .
last year , the state promised to raise legal aid funds to the national average .
attention must now be paid to the needs of community legal centres and their counterparts in their communities , and the government must also invest in this important work .

trump &apos;s campaign team said the media cut off his words , and he did not advocate violence .
in his complaint , bodini asked the campaign team to compensate for his lax supervision , and asked philip to pay compensation for his attacks , beatings and mental injuries .
trump spokesman hawker hx did not respond immediately to the message .
it &apos;s not possible to get in touch with philip .
philip was reportedly leaving the campaign team in the near future , according to a newspaper wccb , a local news agency in charlotte .

the uk must pass the olympic spirit and extend to heathrow airport
it will also bring vitality and prosperity to our communities , london and the entire country .
for me , this is the charm of heathrow , as in the 2012 london olympics , we made every effort to ensure that our countries and regions could benefit from these events .
the olympic games benefited greatly from the stratford and eastern regions .
and we will create opportunities for the benefit of the local population and enterprises in the vicinity of heathrow .
for our local communities alone , we will create 10,000 new jobs , 400,000 new jobs and get young people around the airport to get out of their jobs .
as before the 2012 london olympic games , some people think hologna &apos;s expansion is too large .
i was told that britain would not be able to prepare for the olympics , and we would be humiliated in the face of the world .
the question of those questioned was wrong with the suspicion of the 2012 olympic games , and they would have proved wrong with regard to the suspicion of the heathrow project .
while there is always an obstacle to overcoming the obstacles that need to be overcome , hologna is addressing the problems facing each of them .
as the olympic games , heathrow is the infrastructure project for most people , rather than a few .
the expansion works will create up to 18 million new jobs , bringing about 2110 billion in economic growth , leaving a technology and employment wealth around the airport and across the uk .
we have an excellent heathrow project team , which has completed a 110 infrastructure investment project on time and within the budget , including the t5 terminal of the world &apos;s best airport terminal for five consecutive years and the t2 terminal between the two busiest runways in the world .
now they are ready to build three runways in private investment in pound1.6 billion .
britain successfully organized the 2012 london olympic games , and i believe that the expansion of the project at heathrow airport will also be a great success .
it is time for us to pass the olympic spirit and extend the good time of heathrow airport , so we can sail for our future and create a wealth of pride in technology and employment .
lord paul danton was chairman of the board of trustees of heathrow airport and the minister for commerce of the former british ministry of finance
a woman committed suicide and was run over on the swiss highway
the victim lay on the highway at midnight .
the woman who tried to commit suicide was over on the freeway in the early morning , and the police were looking for witnesses .
the accident happened on the a1 highway near mordeco , on thursday morning .
the warzhou police said a woman was &quot; desperate &quot; lying on the road late in the night and spent over a dozen cars .
the victim was a 49 swiss woman with a clear suicide intention . she was run over by a number of cars , including a truck .
the woman died on the spot .
the police told the police that many of the drivers had been surveyed , but some of the drivers still did not confirm . the police were calling on them and the accident witnesses to receive an investigation .
counsel of the geneva tribune said that the lawyer , gilleshoff , said to the geneva tribune that a criminal investigation had begun , which was a routine process for such incidents .
but it is not yet known whether there will be a charge against the driver .
is it possible to avoid collisions ?
&quot; this will be determined by the prosecutor , &quot; he said .
according to the results of two similar cases in the last five years , the driver will not be held accountable .
it was reported that both cases were due to the fact that the pilot was driven by the expressway in the late night . the final sentence was that the driver could not expect a pedestrian to cross the highway at midnight .
last year , a police officer was charged with negligence as a result of negligence , and the allegation was that in august 2014 , she hit a man and killed a man and died on a a1 highway near paso .
the court was informed that the 22-year-old victim crossed the road after drinking .
after the investigation , the judge said the police officer was in full legality , and the man appeared on the road , &quot; entirely unexpected and unpredictable , &quot; and the police officer then dialed the first aid phone .
any person who could provide information on the accident near mordeco on thursday should call 0216 448346 or 0216 444444 .
nasa climate model : venus was once fit for human habitation
according to nasa &apos;s new climate model , venus was suitable for human habitation .
scientists from the nasa goddard space research institute have developed a model that can explore the past situation of venus , and the tools and algorithms used in this model are similar to that used by climate scientists .
the model is used to determine whether venus , where the surface is high , without water , and the atmosphere full of carbon dioxide , has an environment similar to the earth .
previously , scientists believe that the speed of venus is slower because its atmosphere is thicker .
but the latest simulation suggests that venus is likely to have a thinner , similar atmosphere similar to the earth , and the pace at which time was too slow .
the model also shows the early terrain of venus .
the dry areas of venus may be more than the earth , but there are enough water and geographic changes to breed life and prevent rapid evaporation .
in the early days , the brightness of sunlight on venus was 30 % darker than the earth .
&quot; in a model simulation of the goddard space research institute , the goddard space research institute , anthony del jay , explained in a press conference , &quot; the slow move of venus to the side of the day is nearly two months . &quot;
this makes the surface warming and produces a thick cloud of rain , thick clouds like an umbrella block most of the sun &apos;s heat .
the simulation result is that the average climate temperature of venus is actually lower than the current earth .
the venus evolution of the model is similar to that of the previous planetary scientist .
although there may have been life on venus , venus has been exposed to excessive temperatures and ultraviolet rays over the course of billions of years .
the seas on the planet evaporate , and water vapor is also consumed by ultraviolet rays .
with the escape of hydrogen , there is only a thicker atmosphere of carbon dioxide and a deadly greenhouse gas effect that forms the venus we know today .
the researchers published the simulation results of the new venus climate model in the journal of geophysics research .

the north sea oil field workers stopped the strike and continued negotiations
the chief negotiator said the workers in the north sea field stopped working on pay , and the parties involved in the dispute began a new round of negotiations .
the royal dutch shell , the royal dutch shell , appeared on a number of strikes against oil field service companies wood group on several occasions .
according to a joint statement , &quot; wood group and compliance and rmt trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute . &quot;
we will start a multi-day meeting in the coming weeks to revisit these issues , starting early next week .
the union said its recent action was intended to protest a maximum pay cut of up to 30 per cent , which was the first time the union had taken this action in 25 years .
the wood group has reduced the remuneration of north sea contractors by about 9 % this year due to market pressure .
before the pay cuts , the company reduced the compensation of the maritime contractor by 10 % in 2014 .
the company said another pay cut would help the company survive the market slump .
shell has cut thousands of employees and announced plans to shut down 10 countries , because the company needs to streamline its operations after the merger with the uk energy group .
energy companies are facing a decline in crude oil prices and pressure from the brexit decision in june .
dave anderson , a member of the scottish parliament , met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss the biggest labour dispute in the north sea .
he said the north sea was vital to the region &apos;s economy .
&quot; in the north sea and the entire country , dave said in a statement , &quot; we need a kind of services that serve most people rather than a few . &quot;
in 2016 , expenditures for the new north sea project were expected to exceed $ 1.4 billion , while the average project expenditure for the last five years amounted to approximately $ 70 billion .
kepler measurement of the rotation speed of the star star
the latest mission of the kepler space telescope has helped astronomers gather the most complete rotation speed of the stars of the pleiades star cluster .
the new data are helping astronomers understand why the star &apos;s star has a different rotation speed and the connection between the rotation cycle and the planet .
&quot; we want to learn more about the relationship between star quality , age and even the history of the solar system by comparing our results with other stars , &quot; said luiza ray , a scientist at the center for infrared treatment analysis at the university of california .
the pleiades star cluster is 445 light-years away from the earth .
many of the stars in the cluster were born about 125 million years ago and have just reached adulthood .
they have reached the highest speed of rotation in their lifetime .
these mature stars emit large numbers of stars when reaching the highest rate of rotation .
when these stellar winds pass through the magnetic fields of the stars , they act as a brake on the stars .
as the age of the star increases , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
kepler measured the rotation speed of the stars by tracking the time of trace stars ( like sunspots ) .
the latest wave of self-transmission velocity data sets show that the high quality of the star is slower than the smaller star .
lebrčko likened the star to a dancer , and the larger dancers were rotated at a slower pace than the smaller dancers .
&quot; in the &quot; ballet performance , &quot; the fastest-moving star is often the most light star in the &quot; ballet performance &quot; in the &quot; ballet performance . &quot;
due to the proximity of the pleiades cluster , it can be used as an ideal space laboratory for comparing star quality and rotation speed .
&quot; the pleiades cluster provides the basis for a two-way rotation theory model of young and old stars , &quot; raible said .
we still have a lot of knowledge about how the stars , when , and why slow down their own pace and &quot; pick up their own shoes . &quot;
murray and her colleagues elaborated their latest analysis in three new papers , and the three papers will soon be published in the journal of astronomy .
the south lake water management section chief zheng jun said that the south lake at the bottom of the bottom of more than 10 meters , do not understand the situation of water users , it is likely to be dangerous .
