the junior doctor strikes : calls for new labor action
the primary doctor &apos;s representative called on the union to approve its new labor action against new contract disputes .
the british medical association junior medical council will require all its members to support more labor operations since early september .
the junior doctors &apos; committee said the ministers did not solve the concerns about the contract .
primary doctors and medical students voted in july to boycott contract deals with the british medical association .
of the members who participated in the vote , 58 % opposed the contract .
in a letter addressed to twitter on thursday night , ellen mccourt , chairman of the junior medical council , said the government &quot; has remained silent &quot; for problems that have led to a boycott of the contract .
&quot; in view of this , the executive committee of the junior medical council has voted completely to reject the proposed new contract and called for a formal resumption of consultations on all concerns , &quot; she said .
in response to the government &apos;s silence , the executive committee of the junior medical council has formally requested the council of the british medical association to convene a special meeting to approve a long-term plan aimed at upgrading labor operations from early september .
the dispute has led the junior doctor to participate in six strikes this year , including the first comprehensive strike in the history of the uk &apos;s national health care system .
dr. johann malawana , the leader of the british medical association , resigned after the boycott of the agreed terms of the contract recommended by the british medical association .
in a meeting before 54,000 junior doctors and medical students voted , he told members of the british medical association that the deal was good and should be accepted .
after voting , health minister jeremy hunt said the contract would be enforced in england health care workers .
russia and turkey : &quot; out of tune &quot; ?
a gesture ends a crisis .
russia and turkish leaders met on tuesday , the two sides shook hands and announced the official end of eight months of war of words and economic sanctions .
however , when vladimir putin greeted the president of turkey in a magnificent hall of the st. petersburg palace , i had a strong feeling that the reconciliation was what ankara wanted most to see .
yes , the two sides do shake hands .
however , even in accordance with mr. putin has always been introverted standards , putin is only a shallow smile , almost did not show the meaning of enthusiasm .
according to reports , lei jie pu taipu erdogan five times referred to &quot; good friend &quot; putin .
i can not remember .
at the same time , his commitment to relations with russia will return to the level before the crisis , or even reach a higher level .
the next day , a newspaper wrote that mr. erdogan did not seem to have anything to do .
but i think his passion hints at some of the opposite .
however , mr. putin &apos;s indifferent attitude shows that he has not forgotten anything .
in fact , the first thing he mentioned in his opening remarks was the reason for the crisis : turkey shot down a russian fighter on the syrian border .
moscow &apos;s reaction was intense .
mr. putin furiously criticized the incident , accusing ankara of plotting behind moscow .
the attack from the so-called friends is even more difficult to accept .
the two sides is difficult , or even impossible to re-establish the real trust .
since the beginning of november , russian public opinion has also reversed .
over the past few months , the government-controlled media carried out a shocking full attack on ankara .
suddenly , the turks seemed to be responsible for all things .
among them , the most serious is from the accusations of senior officials : mr. erdogan &apos;s family from the so-called islamic countries controlled syrian illegal profits in the oil trade .
he has categorically denied that .
however , the news from st petersburg shows that it is time to look forward .
after all , the premise of the meeting is that putin received an apology from turkish president erdogan .
russia can declare victory .
for ankara , the benefits of truce are obvious .
first of all , erdogan in the last month after the failure of the coup was almost ousted , so he needs all the support of friends .
the constant terrorist attack has made a big blow to him .
but also economic motives .
russian sanctions are a big hit against turkey , especially for charter flights that can transport millions of russian tourists to the turkish coast each year .
the figure has fallen sharply by nearly 90 % .
with the resumption of flights , the russian travel agencies and charter companies will breathe a sigh of relief .
they will usher in the end of the season to the mediterranean tourism tide .
state television stations even predicted this week that prices of fruits and vegetables would fall as soon as turkish imports of agricultural products were reopened .
&quot; visitors went and tomatoes came back , &quot; a report from the moscow newspaper vedemosti said .
for moscow , the visit also has additional political value .
ankara was angry at the weak reaction of the western world to the intention of taking over .
in addition , ankara is dissatisfied with the slow progress of joining the eu negotiations and putin &apos;s intervention , putin is keen to use political chill and weaken the relationship between turkey and the western world .
as the coup failed to support the elected authorities , the russian leaders will receive ankara &apos;s extra points .
note that this is a gift for moscow , which has been embracing the deep-seated fear of regime change .
thus , the meeting held in this splendid seaside palace made russia and turkey two ally in the western world refused to embezzle the country , an analyst described it as &quot; out of tune &quot; .
however , despite public reconciliation , there are still major differences between the two sides .
syria is one of the key factors . moscow has recently played a role in syria , and russia and turkey have supported the opposite faction .
it is foreseeable that after nearly three hours of initial conversation , the two presidents said at the press conference that they had not yet talked about the topic .
the president of turkey deliberately avoided the question of differences between the two sides , while putin was stressed .
the two sides have reached a clear consensus on how to seek common ground while reserving differences on the syrian issue .
it is certainly a good thing that the leaders of the two countries will be able to restart the dialogue again in the months when the nato members of the north atlantic treaty organization ( nato ) have shot down russian warfare .
royal bank of scotland will no longer serve customers outside of scotland
according to royal bank of scotland ceo , the bank will be simplified as a logistics department .
royal bank of scotland will no longer serve customers outside of scotland .
ross mcewan told the british broadcasting corporation scotland division , the royal bank of scotland brand has been committed to its global ambitions .
but eight years ago on the brink of collapse , had to accept the rescue since then began to give up that pursuit .
during that time , brand strategists use &apos; rbs &apos; to protect other consumer finance brands .
the group has spent millions of pounds to sponsor the rugby six nations and wimbledon tennis championship champion andy murray , etc. sponsored international sports events .
but now , the correct approach is to let more national brands cut a striking figure .
royal bank of scotland will be used by scottish customers , but will not return to the original .
in england and wales , all references outside headquarters and the stock exchange will be changed to national westminster bank .
the alster bank brand has been used by customers in the republic of ireland and northern ireland .
there are a number of other more prominent smaller private banking brands , such as consultants , adam &amp; co , drummond and holt &apos;s military bank .
mr. mcewan was interviewed at the inverness county customer and staff tour .
&quot; the royal bank of scotland brand will eventually become one of our investors &apos; brands and one of the employees &apos; brands , &quot; he told the bbc scottish division , &quot; because we are now a bank with a lot of brands . &quot;
as the bank itself becomes an international brand , rbs has become a global brand .
at present , i want to say is that we no longer focus on the world , we have turned to the local .
each brand represents the difference between their respective industries , and our employees through different brands for customer service .
royal bank of scotland has indicated that it will not continue to sponsor the six-nation championships ; at the same time , efforts have been made to enhance the image of sponsors of different brands in sporting events .
&quot; now when we become a multi - branded bank , we have been looking for a better way to serve our customers , &quot; said the chief executive .
if three years ago we are determined to become a large number of brands with large banks will be ridiculed .
at present we focus on customer needs , and i believe you have noticed these changes .
i think we can restart these brands , and now the time is right .
with the success of predilection in newmarket &apos;s career to win a career of 3,000 wins
newmarket &apos;s two victories helped to get a career of 3,000 wins , and then he champagne to celebrate
on friday , professional jockey officer frankie dettori made his first 3,000 victory at newmarket .
he pursued the predilection from the hands of the trainer john gosden on the road , won two victories in the evening , and achieved a career of 3,000 wins .
the 45-year-old italian is the sixth professional racing jockey in the field of fieldwork .
the top five are gordon richards jazz , doug smith , lester piggott , pat eddery and willie carson .
earlier in ghayyar won the three championship jeseys dali said : &quot; this is very special .
i am very excited because my family is also on the scene
i am happy with my achievements in newmarket because i started from here 30 years ago .
it was not a big jockey , nor the royal ascot , which was just an ordinary friday night with 20,000 spectators .
i am very pleased and very humble .
dai tuli received the predilection after winning , causing the audience cheers
in the field of obstacle , two jockeys have achieved this achievement , namely , the championship jazz richard johnson and retired 20-time champion sir anthony mccoy , where sir mccoy has achieved more than 4,300 victories in his record-breaking career .
berger is the ninth german championship , in his career the communist party made 4,493 victories
it was not surprising that he had made this milestone , and it was not surprising that he had made this achievement before him .
he is fashionable and robust , but really let him stand out in the weighing room is his tactical rationality .
he is a great equestrian ambassador , for many years , his enthusiasm and charm for the sport to attract a large number of fans .
a few weeks ago , i was in epsom with dali said that if he was not just a weekend with a racing jockey , he should have been able to get 6,000 victories !
it is so important that it is true that it is the best equestrian winner of the british thirty years .
his character is lively , it is a good thing for the british horse racing , but in addition , he is an incredible jockey .
wearing a symbol of the jumping action to celebrate this milestone
jumping from the red line to jump off , twenty years , dai li li has been a typical representative of the field of british flat race .
his career is like a roller coaster in general .
he won several championships , including the famous &quot; seven-game winning streak &quot; at the royal ascot jockey club in 1996 . but he also suffered a crash and was banned for taking doping .
three years ago , when he returned to the stadium after the end of the six-month period , he was once very difficult , but he showed a striking character and finally returned to the top , giving those skeptics a blow .
he may not have been a long time - dayton had said before , he hoped to participate at least until the age of 50 years ago .
russian president vladimir putin dismisses the post of director of the office of sergei ivanov
russian president vladimir putin unexpectedly lifted sergei ivanov &apos;s presidency .
over the years , mr. ivanov has been part of the core group of mr. putin &apos;s trust .
the 63-year-old ivanov has now been appointed special representative for environment and transport .
a statement by the kremlin said mr. putin had &quot; declared the dismissal of ivanov &apos;s head of the russian presidential office , &quot; but did not give a reason .
anton vaino , who began as an alternate in mr. ivanov in 2012 , has been appointed as his successor .
mr. vino is 44 years old and is a former diplomat .
he was born in tallinn , estonia , in 1972 , and graduated from the prestigious moscow international institute of international relations ( mgimo ) , working at the tokyo embassy .
later , he managed the draft presidential and government employees , the kremlin website ( in russian ) .
after being appointed , he said to mr putin , &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
i think the most important task of this government is to support the heads of state drafting laws and control instructions to implement .
mr putin told the russian television station on friday that mr. ivanov himself had called for resignation and recommended mr. waino to take over himself .
is this smile so convincing ?
moscow is puzzled by the move .
for a long time , sergei ivanov has been one of putin &apos;s closest assistants , and with putin , also in the soviet security service ( kgb ) work .
as the head of the office , he was one of the most influential people in the country .
in the national television broadcast of a meeting with president putin , the two are called the director of the office asked to resign their own .
despite the smile in front of the camera , but almost no one convinced - especially in the parliamentary elections before this time .
so , is this in a power struggle to defeat the result ?
not yet known .
however , the official statement - a candidate who had been regarded as a presidential candidate , suddenly chose to take charge of russia &apos;s environmental policy - attracted many doubts .
the kremlin website quoted mr ivanov &apos;s dialogue with mr. putin . &quot; yes , early in 2012 , i asked you to give me a difficult job in a conversation , or even a job , a four-year term . &quot;
&quot; the result is that i have been the director of the office of the president for four years and eight months . &quot;
mr. ivanov took the post in december 2011 .
prior to that , he served as deputy prime minister and defense minister .
he is a member of the russian security council and , like mr. putin , is a former member of the national security agency .
at the end of the 1990s , mr. ivanov was appointed as his deputy when mr. putin was head of the federal security agency ( fsb , formerly known as the national security agency ) .
after mr putin took office , he appointed mr. ivanov as one of the five most trusted .
it was once believed that mr. ivanov could become russian president after the second term of mr. putin , because the three re-election was unconstitutional .
but this position eventually belong to putin &apos;s other close assistant dmitry medvedev ( dmitry medvedev ) .
after three and a half years before serving as president , mr. putin served as prime minister of russia .

the queens ferry bridge is now open to fife
the £ 1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed in may 2017
engineers have linked the north bridge and viaducts of queensferry crossing , which means that the bridge is now open to fife .
the four &quot; bridge wind turbines &quot; near the three bridgeheads of each bridge are now nearing completion , and the project is the first bridge .
the bridge , which starts at fife , is 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 metric tons .
it uses 10,000 metric tons of steel , 20,000 metric tons of concrete and 46 oblique cables .
the £ 1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed in may 2017 .
economic secretary keith brown visited the site today as one of the first people to board the bridge .
&quot; this is a historic moment in the construction of the queens ferry bridge , &quot; he said .
we have witnessed the engineering work on such ambitious projects , and more than 30,000 metric tons of concrete and steel are used in this section of the bridge .
although the size and weight of the bridge is very large , but the completion of the viaduct and bridge between the closure of the need for fine operations , the need for very precise assembly .
in general , nearly 79 % of the total bridge is now installed , the last section of the concrete deck bridge deck in rosyth pouring today , that is all the deck have been ready to prepare .
&quot; no matter which bridge project , the first closure is a major milestone , &quot; said michael martin , project director for the queens ferry bridge construction company .
in terms of the great project , the closure of the cutting edge of the civil engineering technology .
after installing the last section of the pavement and connecting it to the enlarged northbridge road deck , the next need to complete the left side or near the land side of the remaining gap closure .
the completion of the operation requires the north elevation bridge to move south by 700 mm .
this is a huge job , but also a very sophisticated job .
said it was large because the viaduct was 222 meters long and weighs about 6,000 metric tons and needs to pull out a slope of about 3 % .
it is precise because the engineering team needs to make sure the deviation is very small , only a few millimeters on each side .
it is gratifying that everything is going well .

forget the hype .
simone biles is not affected by it all .
vogue is full of vitality .

when he saw his total score , beiers could not help but shed tears , and she finally ended the long journey .
beiers is among the same &quot; michael phelps &quot; as the &quot; decades of athletes , &quot; the ranks of their respective areas of sports to a new height :
baier has been dominating the world for the past three years and has won 15 world championship medals , including ten gold medals , and she has been training for her every day to achieve higher accuracy , and mary lou retton , the 1984 olympic champion , said : &quot; beiers is the best gymnast i &apos;ve ever seen .
there is still the last game in brazil , but this game is not so much beers and other gymnastics players competition , as it is her own great pressure between expectations and the contest .
if beiers did not have a gold medal back to her home in spring , texas , everyone would be very disappointed .
simon beers ( left ) from the united states and lisman hugged each other , and they won gold and silver medals in the racing gymnastics women &apos;s individual finals of the 2016 summer olympics in rio de janeiro , brazil , in august ( thursday ) .

this is no coincidence .
the girl who was adopted by her grandmother in her infancy and was found by her mother , aimee boorman , who was traveling on a field trip to the gym , has grown into a backbone .
since the summer of 2013 , beiers has not missed the all-around game , as long as want to win , she will win .
musta fenna has just turned a little illusion after two turns .
balanced wood and liberty gymnastics two projects defending world champion beiers ambush pending .
her balance wood score of 15.433 , free gymnastics score of 15.933 .
while waiting for the final score , lesman gently took baers , and when beiers learned that he had achieved his dream , he had left his tears .
lesman &apos;s performance was a bit like a vengeance four years ago , when she tied for third , but lost to mustafina in the deciding game .
but this time , the 22-year-old captain , who was dubbed the &quot; grandma &quot; by the americans , was leading the way .
she kissed the crowd after the end of the free exercise , declared the return , but this time before the return seems to be in doubt .
beers was only 19 . from earlier on this week , the news spread on twitter , and in the case of baiers , his life has been given new meaning .

why we need simon , gabrielle and laurie
i was like this evaluation of the women &apos;s olympic gymnastics team this year , more than one reason .
first of all , from 1984 onwards , i went to every summer olympic games , but the united states has never occupied such a dominant position .
second , the gymnastics team has three excellent gymnasts - simone biles , gabby douglas and lauren laurie hernandez , who have inspired many colored girls .
the composition of this team makes everyone feel proud , because it contains the jewish ali lisman ( aly raisman ) and the catholic madison kexian ( madison kocian ) .
this team finally looks like the us team .
it also reinforces the pinnacle of black and latino women in this sport .
over the past four years , the leading female gymnast has been an african-american .
last year , simon and gabriel were the first and second .
this is too much .
the last olympic games , gabriel leo douglas &quot; unexpected &quot; to become the olympic champion , which makes the united states cheered endless .
today , the world can witness the three world champion simon beiers , douglas and laurie hernandez brilliant performance of their traditional gymnastics skills to deduce the superb .
thursday , simon helped the us team in the women &apos;s individual all-around project to achieve four consecutive championships .
her teammate ali lisman won the silver medal .
we boarded the pinnacle of the sport , but in the whole gymnastics teaching class is not the case .
simon , gabrielle and laurie into the olympic team with the way ali and madison .
they are &quot; final five &quot; ( final five ) , because the next olympic gymnastics team will be composed of four gymnasts , which is marta karolyi last year coaching .
but the reality is that gymnastics is a costly exercise , and gymnasts are trained primarily in private gymnastics clubs where their parents need to pay for training , facilities , travel , clothing , competitions and hotel expenses ( including coaches and gymnasts and family ) , and the cost list is increasing .
most of the gymnastics clubs are located in the affluent suburbs that can support the industry .
all the gymnastics training is done at these clubs , which is a long-term costly expense for the gymnast &apos;s family .
beers &apos; coach aimee boorman and hernandez coach maggie haney have been teaching them since the two gymnasts started practicing gymnastics .
we must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics to countless young girls who are deeply influenced by simon , gabrielle and laurie .
20 years ago , i set up my own gymnastics foundation .
in my organization , we offer free , cheap gymnastics to more than 15,000 urban youth ( mainly black and hispanic americans ) in black residential areas and train national and world champions .
in september , we will expand to detroit ( my hometown ) to provide high quality gymnastics to young people who deserve this opportunity to learn and benefit from this great olympic sport .
gymnastics helps to develop the body &apos;s strength , flexibility and coordination , but also help to cultivate hard-working spirit , self-discipline and determination .
these can bring lifelong benefits to a person &apos;s health , school and work success .
encouraged by this team , thousands of young girls will learn gymnastics , it is really great .
it is of great importance to the sport , especially for girls .
this is an exciting moment .
thanks to simon , ali , laurie , gabrielle and madison in the olympic gold medal in the process of winning the wonderful &quot; girl power &quot; , but also thank them to inspire so many different background young girls open to health , strong , successful road .
after dismissing jeremy hunt &apos;s proposal , the junior doctor plans to launch a further strike
the ministers initially wanted to end the change-induced dispute by accepting a revised contract from the british medical association ( bma ) , but 58 percent of the 37,000 primary doctors who participated in the vote were opposed to the contract .
in july , mr. hunter revealed plans to enforce the contract , he said the british national health service system ( nhs ) is currently in the &quot; vacuum zone &quot; , a slight delay will damage the interests of employees and patients .
the new contract first mentions the revision of the junior doctor &apos;s overnight and weekend work practices to improve the care of non-normal working hours .
&quot; there was still a serious concern about the proposed contract , especially for fear that it would exacerbate the current labor crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly , &quot; said dr. ellen mccourt , chairman of the bma junior medical council last night , in a statement .
it took only eight weeks to sign a new contract from the first doctors , and we needed to make progress and it was running out of time .
bma tried to resolve the dispute through negotiations , but we were reluctant to participate , and sometimes the government responded silently .
nevertheless , last month we still got jeremy hunt &apos;s promise that he said his door was always open .
&quot; jeremy hunt now needs to take action to cancel the enforcement , to solve the problem of the junior doctor &quot; worried .
if he does not do so , the junior doctor makes it clear that they are ready to take further labor action .
the last strike occurred at the end of april , resulting in nearly 13,000 regular surgery and 100,000 appointments due to nurses and attendants who screened the doctors on the picket line .
ministers initially wanted to end the dispute caused by the change by accepting the bma revised contract .
bma hopes to get better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors involved in the contract .
daniel mortimer , chief executive officer of nhs employers , called on the junior doctor not to take any further strike .
&quot; labor has little effect , but on the contrary , it puts pressure on teams and services that are already devoted , leading to concerns , worries and confusion among patients , caregivers and their families , &quot; mr. mortimer said .
over the past two months , we have been negotiating with the junior medical council and actively with the ministry of health and other departments to respond to their concerns about the role of guardians and reports .
employers want to continue to actively explore other important topics - such as deployment , training flexibility , other training , training costs , general knowledge of training courses , training fake and gender differences in the medical field for those who are postponed after a career break , which shows that employers , the health education england and the ministry of health attach great importance to the agreements reached in november , february and may with bma .
a £ 2 drug per day reduces the risk of heart attack
officials suggested that a $ 2 drug per day should be extended to more patients and prolonged medication , after which thousands of heart patients would benefit from the drug .
antithrombotic ticagrelor can reduce the risk of heart disease recurrence in patients with heart disease .
the drug continues to take 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or heart attack .
the national institutes of health and clinical optimization ( nice ) , a regulator of the national health service system ( nhs ) , recommends that patients continue to take four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease .
but now , nhs regulators nice recommends that patients continue to take four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease .
in england , about 140,000 people suffer from heart disease each year , and a quarter of them continue to experience heart disease recurrence or stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by the formation of plaque in the arterial wall .
if the plaque is broken , it will lead to thrombosis , and thus impede the flow of blood into the heart , leading to heart attack .
if the thrombus moves , it will enter the bloodstream , hinder blood flow into the brain , leading to stroke .
those who have experienced a heart attack have a higher risk of heart attack again .
ticagre is manufactured by british company astrazeneca and sold under the trade name brilique to reduce the risk of thrombosis by reducing thrombus formation .
the nice guideline today announced that patients should take 90 mg of ticagrex for 12 months , followed by 60 mg ticagrel and aspirin twice daily for three years .
&quot; despite the effective secondary prevention , but as many as a quarter of patients with a history of heart attack will once again develop disease or stroke , which can have serious consequences , &quot; said professor carole longson , director of the nice health technology assessment center .

computer culture makes &quot; election fraud &quot; prevailing in muslim areas
former hamlet former mayor lutfur rahman was dismissed last year for corruption and prompted a government report to be published .
the &quot; political correctness &quot; culture has led to the vagueness of electoral fraud that is prevalent in the muslim community , and the report ,
former cabinet minister sir eric pickles accused the police , the electoral regulators and the city hall of turning a blind eye to the evidence of abuse of the election because of &quot; excessive sensitivity to racial division and religious problems &quot; .
the former community affairs minister , the current anti-corruption leader , said that the practice of intimidating voters in religious positions was bad , and that the police should be allowed to set up a cordon outside the polling station to protect frightened voters .
he suggested that voters vote to carry identity documents to confirm their identity .
at present , voters only need to report their name and address can be .
the report even suggested that the voters should be painted on the brush , to prevent someone to vote twice .
sir eric said that the protection of whistleblowers should be increased .
he called for increased media awareness of the documents of the meeting and the way in which decisions were made by unofficial committees or working groups .
&quot; it &apos;s not just to guard against election fraud , but also to protect the local government from widespread corruption culture and the financial fraud that is closely linked to it , &quot; he said .
the report was released in east london after the tower hamlets election scandal , downing street asked .
last year , a special electoral court ruled that there was a series of corrupt and illegal acts in the mayor rahman , which should be dismissed .
the court found that rahman &quot; was very ridiculous to abuse &quot; the religious feelings of the muslim community and talked about allegations of racial discrimination and islamophobia .
it is said that rahman &quot; in the campaign declared to vote for him is a religious obligation of loyal muslims .
as many as 300 votes in doubt , may be voters counterfeiters vote .
sir eric said there was evidence that there were electoral fraud in the country .
in particular , he warned of postal election fraud , and it was said that senior members of the muslim community had exerted pressure on voters to force the voters to vote for the candidates they designated .
sir eric ( photo ) gave a number of suggestions on the clean-up voting mechanism , including a good identity document to confirm his identity
&quot; evidence suggests that senior members , especially senior members of the pakistan and bangladesh background communities , exert pressure on vulnerable groups , especially women and young people , in some ethnic minority communities to allow them to vote according to their own wishes , &quot; he said in the report .
&quot; because of the over-sensitivity of racial division and religious &apos; political correctness &apos; , they fear that state agencies will turn a blind eye to such behavior . &quot;
sir eric proposed 50 proposals to clean up the electoral mechanism , including the prohibition of political activists in handling mailing papers to prevent &quot; voting gains &quot; .
the report also requires thorough investigation of registration information to prevent voter lists from being used for immigration and welfare fraud , and theresa may is also considering the report .
these proposals include requiring voters to present their identity documents before voting .
after the vote on the voter finger painted on the ink can not be wiped to prevent someone to vote twice .
systematically verifies the nationality of the electorate to ensure that the voters are eligible .
will automatically post a polling request for a period of three years .
prohibit political activists and militants to deal with completed mailing and mailing envelopes .
authorize the police to set up a cordon around the polling station .
modify the legal provisions , making it easier to sue the person concerned for intimidation in accordance with the representation of the people act 1983 .
it is illegal to take pictures at the polling station .
provided that english can only be used at polling stations ( except wales ) .
strengthen training to ensure that staff strictly enforce the &quot; voters to the polling hall alone &quot; requirement .
sir eric denounced the metropolitan police , saying that they did not raise any charges of allegations after the tower hamlets incident , which was &quot; surprising &quot; .
&quot; rahman and his electoral officers have a lot of corruption and illegal acts and are therefore subject to the removal of the electoral tribunal , &quot; he said .
in accordance with the criminal certification standards , he is in many ways no doubt is guilty .
he also criticized the city hall election registration department in the form of &quot; check box check &quot; .
sir eric said : &quot; last year the court ruled on the tower hamlets that we sounded the alarm .
our country has a glorious tradition of &quot; the mother of parliament &quot; , but some institutions privately sneaky election fraud and the subsequent despair is really worrying , but also threaten this good reputation .

whether it is from the front , or behind you , the video will teach you how to turn for victory .
mizrachi said that if the gunman approached you from behind , the first thing you had to do was turn around so that you could see the attacker and &quot; clear the line of fire &quot; .
then , with the forearm and shoulder grip gun , and then use your elbow hit the attacker &apos;s face .
then with his knees at the top of his groin , when the attacker bent down due to pain , to reverse his gun , with the barrel and the reserve gun group to fight his face , keep the arms have been aimed at him .
if the gunman approached from the front , also use a similar technique - let your body is not within the line of fire , take the gun and reverse the muzzle , so gunmen can not fire .
at the same time , press the weight on the gun and hit the attacker &apos;s chest , and from his hand to reverse the muzzle , and then the muzzle at him .
sounds complicated ?
look at the video and see what mizrachi is doing .
but keep in mind that if you are not a master of martha , the safest way to get rid of robbery is to hand over cash .
a rogue family was destroyed before the destruction of low-cost housing in cornwall , soltas

&quot; it &apos; s a nightmare for people who live here , and i do not think people can live like that , &quot; she said .
there are a lot of things that need to be weighed , because this house is likely to be a very good element in cornwall .
this family is notorious and their names are notorious .
the couple have three sons and they will stay here from time to time , and the police say the terrorist acts of the family include the use of baseball bats to fight on the streets , intimidate nearby residents , drug addicts , drug trafficking , shouting , quarreling and cursing .
in june , the 47-year-old tenant named skeldon received an anti-social behavior resolution .
in the house where the building may be demolished , many rooms are kept for a long time
the room was lifted in the room where the drug had been traded
neighbors said they often see them fighting on the streets , and often so the police

and finally relieved neighbors to cheer for this , they said that before the life is simply hell on earth .
&quot; they do not care about anyone , &quot; said one neighbor .
we stayed for 20 years in the neighborhood , and it was so bad .
we have seen the police countless times .
&quot; this morning we could not sleep . &quot;
we got up early , because it was too quiet - we were not used to it !
they are finally gone , really good .
adam fitzpatrick , community executive manager at the cornwall housing association , said the family did not work well with the local government .
the family lived in the house for 20 years , and the police often visited
garbage and old toys are thrown in the low-rent housing weed side
&quot; regrettably , the tenant did not take any responsibility for her behavior with her family , &quot; he added . &quot; the expulsion was the last thought of the cornwall housing association . &quot;
this is a very difficult case to deal with , because their behavior is very extreme , and their actions must also make the neighbors feel extremely fear .
i would like to thank my team for the work done , thanks also to devon county and the cornwall police and community members who are brave enough to provide information to us .
i hope this will give the neighbors a little comfort and pass on a message that we will not tolerate antisocial behavior .
mr. fitzpatrick said that their three sons lived in the house at different times , but also said that they were only 20 years old .
after they were driven away , one of the bedrooms had a dirty mattress on the floor
housing association workers will soon clean up the rubbish around the house
in 2014 , the police had searched the house and found more than 70 grams of marijuana , also found a balance , drug addicts and 1,700 pounds in cash .
after pleading guilty , skeldon was fined for holding class b drugs and drug trafficking intentions .
she claims that the money is used to give death to the car accident in 2013 , lee skeldon to buy the tombstone .
it is understood that after homelessness , tanya and her husband now live in a private house in plymouth .
the walls of the room are full of graffiti .
police said they would expel tenants who defied the tenant rules .
angela crow of devon county and cornwall police said the expulsion gave a clear warning to other tenants who continued to violate the tenant rules .
&quot; this warning is aimed at those who think that their actions will not be criticized , and those who suffer by this behavior , &quot; she said .
devon county and cornwall police station will never tolerate crime and antisocial behavior , and they will continue to work together to protect our community .

china &apos;s mars plan came
china &apos;s mars exploration mission to achieve a surround , landing , patrol , this form has never been in foreign countries .
china &apos;s mars exploration launch target is to want to step around , landing , patrol , this task has considerable difficulty .
because the mars probe to 26 months to encounter a time window , so the experts are closely working on the project plan for the 2020 launch of this window , china &apos;s first mars detector .
according to xu dazhe , although china &apos;s aircraft has entered a deep space , but the completion of the task of mars exploration is still indispensable , the detection of mars means that china from the true sense into the deep space exploration era .
&quot; every two or three years , there is a chance that mars is closest to earth , and that at this point in time the mars probe is the most energy for the launch vehicle . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the quality of mars detectors , will be china &apos;s long march 5 launch vehicle to complete the launch mission . &quot;
china &apos;s mars exploration mission to achieve a surround , landing , patrol , this form is never in foreign countries , foreign countries have once to achieve a surround and landing , but the landing failed .
mars exploration involves a lot of technical areas , in particular , is that although the rover is a space detector , but compared with the general space detector , it has a distinctive feature .
in other words , the mars probe must have the ability to determine the driving route and find the risk of obstacles .
china aerospace science and technology group five researcher pang zhihao said that the reason why man is so favored by mars exploration , because the detection of mars has important scientific , technical and other aspects of significance , and even related to the future of mankind .
at present , mars has become the planet with the highest degree of human research outside the earth , the history of human use of space detectors mars exploration almost throughout the history of human space .
therefore , the human hope that one day in mars to establish a base of residence , and ultimately to mars immigration , it turned into a second home of mankind .
a large number of signs also show that mars is likely to be the same as the current earth , only after billions of years of evolution into the atmosphere thin , low temperature , water depletion and so on .
therefore , the detection or manned landing on mars to study , can prevent the earth into a human difficult to survive the second mars put forward plans .
as of june 2016 , the world conducted a total of 114 lunar exploration , 43 mars detection .
however , since the 90s of the 20th century , mankind has carried out 18 mars exploration , and the moon probe only carried out 14 times .
there are currently five mars orbiters and two mars rovers at work , but only one lunar orbiter and one lunar lander are working .
the world &apos;s space powers have developed a mars system as the goal of the detection plan , we can see , today &apos;s mars exploration is still hot than the lunar exploration .
november 5 , 2013 , india launched the first mars probe &quot; mangalian &quot; , becoming asia &apos;s first successful detection of mars countries .
&quot; mangalian &quot; is used to study the surface of mars , the atmosphere and mineral characteristics , to explore whether there is methane on mars and signs of life .
the hardest part of this mission is that the probe enters the martian atmosphere after the aerodynamic profile and parachute deceleration is only one chance
according to the china aerospace science and technology corporation , the overall design of the institute of mars mars , the total designer sun zezhou introduction , mars exploration task is facing many technical challenges .
mars atmospheric pressure is very low , only 1 % of the earth &apos;s surface atmospheric pressure , with high uncertainty .
scientists have not had a thorough understanding of factors such as its changes and the characteristics of the storm .
mars in the summer often form a dust storm similar to the earth &apos;s dust weather , which will lead to rover solar energy received a sharp decline in the design of the rover must be &quot; sleep &quot; mode , let it wait patiently dust storms in the past .
at the same time , the martian atmosphere has a reducing effect on the sun &apos;s light , which poses a problem for the energy supply for mars detection .
this requires the detector &apos;s sun wing area is larger , and need to constantly adjust , and strive to align the sun direction .
also , the surface gravity of mars is only 38 % of the earth , but most of the gravity on the surface of the moon , so the detector needs more power .
&quot; the core of the mars exploration mission , the most difficult place , is the probe into the martian atmosphere after the aerodynamic shape and parachute deceleration process , only one chance , must ensure success .
sun ze said that because the distance between the earth and mars , the whole process can not be controlled by the ground in real time , it must rely on the detector to complete their own .
because there is not so much propellant to offset the high speed , so landing on mars , the slowdown to rely on the role of the martian atmosphere , but the martian atmosphere is difficult to simulate the ground .
pang zhihao said , in general , the way to detect mars and the way the moon is similar , but also &quot; around , down , patrol , back &quot; , and ultimately to achieve the goal of manned landing mars .
because mars is much more distant from the earth than the earth , so the detection of mars need to overcome a series of more complex technical difficulties .
according to taiwan media reports , taiwan &quot; chief executive &quot; lin quan announced yesterday morning , &quot; political parties and their accompanying organizations improperly obtained property handling regulations &quot; since today effective .
kmt vice chairman zhanqi xian said , &quot; a hundred years of history of the kuomintang , social commitment with the responsibility , not so close . &quot;

he said that by gu lixiong as the chairman of the committee is not the two candidates , to use hong peigen to examine the relevant major cases of experience , as the commission will check the basis of the relevant cases of misconduct .
zhan qixian that today as long as there are party production , no one will give you social donations , if the party was all confiscated away , the kuomintang can just ask for social support and sponsorship , &quot; today really have no chance to go . &quot;
zhan qixian also stressed that even if the party production regulations on the road , the kuomintang party production is not fully confiscated , confiscated , the rest will continue to promise to donate , so that the party is zero , the party to all from scratch .

these messages or true or false , the answer until the apple 2016 autumn conference to be announced .
but this does not prevent the industry optimistic about the prospects of iphone7 - many people think that iphone7 will be likely to become apple &apos;s iphone series of the last major upgrade .
although the market research firm idc recently published data from the point of view , iphone &apos;s market share has declined .
among them , goldman sachs will apple &apos;s stock to &quot; buy &quot; rating , and bmo analysts believe that iphone7 will gain a historic sales results .

according to informed sources , recently , suning executives and apple frequently meet , the purpose is to prepare adequate supply .
operators have been negotiated with suning , it is foreseeable that , with the depth of cooperation between the two sides , will inevitably bring lower prices for users and more intimate services .

on the morning of august 12 , the state council information office held a press conference on the operation of the national economy in july 2016 .
national bureau of statistics spokesman , national economic statistics division , said shenglai yun , in july , the national economic sector indicators have slowed down , but still run in a reasonable range .
national bureau of statistics released data show that in july fixed asset investment growth , total imports and other data has come down .
on the run of the national economy in july , i would like to take advantage of the phrase &quot; the shape is volatile and the potential is still good &quot; that the prime minister once said . this can better summarize the characteristics of the economic operation in july .
he explained that &quot; the shape of the fluctuations &quot; refers to the july part of the economic indicators growth is indeed down .
because in july the domestic and international economy is still in the depth of adjustment , the international situation is complex and changeable , the world economic recovery is less than expected , so the export pressure is still relatively large .
from the domestic situation , the whole economy is still in the critical stage of adjustment , adjust the pain in the release of the economy is facing no small downward pressure , so some indicators of some fluctuations .
sheng to transport that there is a special case in july , floods are more serious , high temperature and heat the weather in some areas of the production and operation has brought some impact .
according to the ministry of civil affairs recently released the situation , the country more than 6000 million people affected , direct economic losses of more than 200 billion yuan .
from the industrial , investment , transport-related indicators , these areas are affected to varying degrees .
july cargo turnover growth rate than last month fell 3.6 percentage points , floods on these areas have a certain impact on traffic .
from these factors , some indicators of volatility in july is also very normal , but also in the expected .
he said , &quot; potential is still good &quot; means that despite the economic growth has come down , but the overall economic stability , steady progress , steady and good momentum has not changed .
july cpi rose 1.8 % , the chain rose 0.2 % ; january-july cpi rose 2.1 % , so the overall price stability situation .
according to the chongqing municipal meteorological bureau portal on the district hot weather statistics , in addition to youyang , the rest of the city can receive different degrees of high temperature allowance .
at present , at least 28 provinces in the country have clearly defined the standard for the payment of benefits , but the standards issued by provinces and municipalities are not the same , while chongqing is the high temperature allowance for high temperature allowance .
35 ℃ above 37 ℃ below , according to per person per day not less than 10 yuan standard release ; 37 ℃ above , per person per day not less than 15 yuan standard release .
40 ℃ above the high temperature staff can receive up to 20 yuan / day allowance ( workers have to enjoy the high temperature job allowance except ) .
in accordance with this standard , the highest number of hot days last month , the largest number of days to receive 330 yuan , the smallest number of days the city is 80 yuan , and the maximum temperature of youyang did not meet the high temperature standards , so there is no high temperature allowance .
in the past , many units will be a cool drink to the high temperature allowance , the city safety supervision bureau said that this behavior does not meet the current approach .
due to high temperature weather to stop working , shorten the working hours , the employer shall not deduct or reduce the wages of workers .
municipal social council said that employees encountered high temperature jobs but did not receive high temperature allowance , through the enterprise labor dispute mediation agencies for legal rights , or call 12333 complaints .
if the employing unit refuses to pay the high temperature allowance , the laborer may lodge a complaint with the competent social security department of human resources at the county level or above .
at the same time because the high temperature allowance is part of the wage , not welfare , to be included in the total wages , deduct a tax .
therefore , high-temperature allowance is not within the minimum wage , must be issued in cash , can not use drinks and other objects instead .

&quot; the situation in gracia is very special , and its remaining part of the beak is less than 1 centimeter , so it is difficult to install the new beak . &quot;

in some nights , the ionosphere is full of free electrons , which means that the radio signal can go further .
according to the us &quot; popular science &quot; monthly website august 11 reported that the us air force on the effect of copying this interest .
although having a large number of free electrons in the ionosphere can help people in a university radio broadcast range to listen to the radio , but this may not be the us air force &apos;s interest .
the electronic ionosphere means that the radio used by the military has a larger range of broadcasts and that it may provide some protection for the global positioning system ( gps ) signal from the solar storm .
the ultimate goal may be to build a series of cube satellites on demand , which can strengthen the ionosphere when needed .

industry data show that the total size of coal production in 2015 close to 6 billion tons , the national coal production capacity of 1.8 billion tons .
over the past decade , the state council issued a total of five times before and after the elimination of excess and backward production capacity of the notice .
although the first four times for the coal industry , but the target industry directly with the coal industry have a relationship .
last year in november to january this year , qinhuangdao 5500 kcal thermal coal prices long in 370 yuan / ton low hovering , 90 % of the coal enterprises into a loss .
since february , coal prices gradually picked up , the recent qinhuangdao thermal coal prices rose continuously for four weeks , rose to 16-month high , once climbed to 436 yuan per ton , up nearly 70 yuan over the beginning .
with the price rise , the community worried about the resulting : a group of small coal mines will not return to work ?
in this regard , china ( hainan ) reform and development institute of economic research institute kuang xianming conducted an analysis and interpretation .
kuang xianming : to produce a high degree of concern to the parties , today announced the coal industry to the production capacity of the transcripts really make everyone feel more worried .
these three superficial factors reflect the relative lag behind the shift in the way we grow in the past , that is , government-led growth has not yet been fundamentally changed .
second , this is also directly related to the promotion of local governments , in the process of production capacity , the funds and the corresponding supporting measures should be in place , from this point of view , the differences in different regions is indeed relatively large .
third , if the current progress of some of the provinces to be in progress in the second half , they may face greater risk .
in this case , relying on the central prize to raise funds to advance the process of production capacity may have a negative impact .
first , the production capacity is not a simple total control .
our goal is to eliminate the backward production capacity , promote the optimization of the structure , the restructuring of the entire coal industry , the new format .
in the process of deployment to the production capacity , the local government must put the production capacity and the transformation and upgrading of the coal industry combined to vigorously develop the relevant services .
second , in order to complete this year &apos;s capacity to do this year &apos;s task , we must give full play to the power of administrative supervision and administrative supervision .
finally , we want to strengthen the role of social security .
because the market is directly related to the employment problem , so we have to strengthen the employment skills of employees and workers training .

however , in the first half of 2016 , international direct investment in brazil had reached $ 33.8 billion , an increase of almost 10 per cent compared to the same period last year .

ningze tao in the 100 meters freestyle semi-final performance , has a lot of chinese audience speechless .
may be in the 50-meter freestyle preliminaries , ningze tao once again refresh the people &apos;s &quot; bottom line . &quot;
in fact , 50 meters freestyle is not ning zetao main items , his performance in the kazan world championships and the best results , but also decided his breakthrough in this project is unlikely .
sure enough , the authority of the media in hong kong , &quot; ta kung pao &quot; revealed that ning ze tao lost the biggest reason is that he has lost interest in swimming .
owing to many factors , may have a great impact on his future ideas , he is now more interested in entering the entertainment .
kazan world championships , ningze tao with its ultra-high value and good results , and instantly become a net red
as a result , &quot; national husband &quot; , &quot; small fresh meat &quot; , &quot; pattern beauty &quot; and other titles continue to be his label .
a variety of commercial activities come to the door , a good way to money , as a golden flashing road .
in this case , ningze tao even choose to retire at this time to join the entertainment circle , not only his freedom , but also a seemingly viable way .
after all , he is only 23 years old , after a certain degree of study , can rely on its popularity starred in one or two tv series .
but ningze tao need to see their own and these predecessors compared to , is not enough qualified ?
2000 sydney olympic games , has 21 years old liu xuan has come to the end of the athlete &apos;s career .
liu xuan beautiful appearance so that she was quickly remembered , but also laid her future into the entertainment circle basis .
after retirement , liu xuan starred in a number of tv series , and in 2013 set up their own studio .
tian liang participated in two olympic games single and double ten meters race , and won 2 gold 2 silver .
but in the 2004 olympic games ten thousand dollars in the game lost to teammates hu jia , tian liang &apos;s competitive state of decline , and was burst out of the diving team dismissed .
and he and his daughter to participate in &quot; father to where &quot; and other variety show , but also let him pocketed the eye .
once the gymnastics gold generation yang wei , li xiaopeng and chen yibing are high-profile to participate in a variety of variety show .
it is worth mentioning that , yang wei li xiaopeng was led by china won the 2008 olympic men &apos;s team champion , yang wei is twice to get a personal all-around gold medal , known as the almighty king .
and chen yibing in the lead china to get the 2012 olympic group champion at the same time , has become a ring king .
and in the london olympic games suffered a misjudgment of the loss of gold medal , chen yibing big move , let him ring powder countless .
but these athletes are still the main energy in the arena , for the variety show is only as superficial - hit and left .
but whether it is retired or active athletes , can get the favor of the entertainment industry need to have to get the results to do the protection .
after all , athletes into a new field , whether it is ability or network , are a blank state .
even tian liang , liu xuan , such a mixed entertainment for many years the &quot; old man &quot; , the general audience to mention them , more or think of their performance in the olympic games .
and yang wei , li xiaopeng and other new people in the variety show when the presentation , without exception , are &quot; olympic champion . &quot;
compared to the above several people , ningze tao a swimming world championship title or slightly thin .
moreover , compared to tian liang , liu xuan , yang wei and others into the body back , ningze tao if the 23-year-old career career setbacks on the rapids , the negative impact on its image is probably immeasurable .
after all , mention the athletes , people &apos;s requirements are &quot; not seeking victory , but for fear of danger , &quot; ningze tao is also a lot worse from this point .
back ten thousand steps that ningze tao looks handsome , can rely on the value of thousands of brain residual powder to get the support .
no point skill , just look , want to mix in the entertainment , this difficulty is not better than the training to find the state is difficult to find it .
the choice of life depends on individual wishes , but in the end how to choose , ningze tao heart should be there .

in late august , japanese prime minister shinzo abe will go to kenya to attend the 6th african development conference , according to the voice of china .
the african development conference was dominated by japan , and the previous five meetings were held in tokyo , japan or yokohama , so this meeting will be the first move to africa .
japanese ministry of foreign affairs officials said that holding a meeting in africa will help cause african and european countries to pay attention to japan .
in line with the trip to shinzo abe , according to kyodo news agency , the japanese liberal democrats will send parliamentary groups to the countries concerned .
japan &apos;s &quot; often &quot; road began in the early 90s of last century , and by the african-sponsored african development conference also began in 1993 , this is not a coincidence !
africa in the united nations has 53 seats , is the united nations important ticket positions , japan to &quot; into the regular &quot; , how will abandon africa ?

japan to achieve their goals , first of all to do a good job with the surrounding countries , which , whether in geopolitical competition or in the national dispute and historical understanding of the problem , japan needs to have a correct attitude .

whether it is because of age or playing time is limited , each season there are some players will appear regressive performance .
of course , some &quot; back &quot; may just shrink the data , the strength of these players may not decline .
even if wade is still one of the league &apos;s best scoring guard , but his performance in the bulls should not have the heat so well .
he and longdu composition of the backcourt range is limited , headed star butler &apos;s third hit rate is only 32.8 % , which makes them next season &apos;s attack will play very crowded .
came to the windy city , the power is bound to give the ball more right to butler and rondo , he is likely to choose in the regular season to play health .
okafor &apos;s situation is more embarrassing , as the first choice of 76 people last season , he had to compete with simmons and enbid in the new season to play time and ball rights .
this competition may not come soon , simmons also need to adapt to the nba stadium , enbi must also be fully recovered from the injury as soon as possible , but okafor can 76 people in the long array position is still a problem .
last season , okafor 32 % of the score from the low attack , the proportion is higher than cousins , wuchevich and brook lopez , while his use rate is also the top 40 in the league .
with simmons already showing excellent ball striker potential , en beide also has a more suitable for the nba game body , okafor &apos;s position is probably so hard and so solid .
over the past two seasons , thompson &apos;s usage has stabilized in the league &apos;s top 20 , and this is his career &apos;s best two seasons .
but the problem is , with the arrival of durant , thompson &apos;s use rate will decline , which is bound to affect his play .
this effect will not only be the impact of the number of shots , tang god &apos;s ball attack in the next season will certainly be greatly reduced , which in some ways will reduce the opponent &apos;s defense of his difficulty .
durant &apos;s arrival will certainly let the warriors players data shrink , but which is probably the most serious shrink thompson .
but this does not mean that the level of soup god backwards , it is more like he made a sacrifice for the team as a whole .
parker had better performance than last season , not only because his basket came to his highest level of efficiency , he and aldrich &apos;s chemical reaction also benefit the spurs .
duncan retired , ginobili announced a battles year , the combination of gdp eventually came to an end , as the youngest of three people , the french sports car fuel tank is not much oil .
after getting the third championship ring , only kareem abdul-jabbar , jordan and russellby james won more regular season mvp , while jordan was the only one who had fmvp better than james .
oh , yes , james has just brought the first professional sports championship trophy in cleveland for the past 52 years .
came to the occupation of the 14th season of james need to better ensure physical strength , ready for the playoffs .
therefore , in the regular season , james &apos;s data is likely to further decline , he will give more weight to owen to bear , but he will still easily become the league &apos;s top three players .

the british team won the silver medal in the seven-man rugby game and the fiji team won the gold medal
in the final of the seven-man rugby final in the evening of thursday , the british team failed to perform before the fiji team before the success of the fiji team to 43 to 7 in the rio teodoro stadium beat .
fiji won the gold medal in terms of ball , steals , avoidance , rallying , running and strength , which is also the first olympic medal in the country &apos;s history .
the silver medal was a big consolation for the defeated british team , which was the third silver medal that the british delegation had received that day , enough to make the british football team proud : they beat new zealand , argentina and south africa on the first seven-man rugby tournament .
earlier in the day , the british team won the south african team at 7-5 , which could have affected them in the finals .
but in any case , the current fiji team is enough to beat a full 15 full of the team .
tomorrow , at least one of the british will wear a gold medal , which may be a comfort for the british team , but it may not be the british is from wimbledon fiji coach ben ryan , he served as head coach of the british team .
it is not easy for the british team to achieve today &apos;s results .
eight years ago , under the ryan &apos;s teachings , they did not win fruit at the adelaide international seven-man football competition .
and now , they are only a step away from the championship .
although they have been a huge blow , but also made a very amazing progress .
fiji opened to dominate the british team without parry .
for tom mitchell and his teammates , it was like a series of buses that were driving , and when the océ corinthians plunged into the flag area , the world championship team had already taken the lead in a 5-0 match .
only four minutes after the game , jerry tuohua again in the right touchdown .
12 to 0 , the british team almost did not hit the ball
mitchell &apos;s strong interceptions gave the giants a general lyon kaleva no third , but that was only a slowdown in fiji &apos;s scoring .
in 7 minutes , asa wei le ma lu in the right corner touch .17 to 0 , the british team worse .
that cara lava has a point , and the game ... ... the first half left 1 minute .
then , wattmo lavo broke the defensive line of the british team , straight to the scoring line .
midfield rest , the score is already 29 to 0 .
fijians are like being born to play 7-a-side football , and the british team is still fledgling .
this is the case .
the british team in the second half made a huge change and in a full four minutes impact on the fiji defense , the first half , this performance has been very good , but after the fiji team played a wonderful match , again by joshua tuoyuo suowa score again .
dan norton for the british team to create a chance to score , he touched the left corner , the score changed to 36 to 7 , but the game has long been in the south island country control , their fans on the platform singing , waving flags , singing and dancing .
fiji &apos;s wonderful performance is too climsy .
martha william at the last minute to prevent the fiji team &apos;s indifferent attack .
the final whistle sounded , the fijians embrace together , and the defeat of the british team can only regret the exit .
earlier in the day , fiji defeated the japanese team 20 to 5 in the semifinals , while the british won the south african team against a fierce semi-final match .
the first half kyle brown helped the south african team lead , but dan norton scored in the second half with excellent footwork .
after the england team anthony &apos;s brother marcus watson with a wonderful interception to ensure that the team &apos;s victory , the final british team won the silver medal .
helen graff and heather steinning were inspired by the cancer coach and won the gold medal
it is no exaggeration to say that this is the most touching gold medal .
from the beginning of the first rowing to the present , helen graff and heather steinning have received 220 punitive training , and their gold medal at estacio da lagoa has a more remarkable meaning .
although the paddies are only the two of them , but there is a man on board - coach robin williams - the voice has been accompanied by their impact on the second consecutive women &apos;s double paddle olympic gold medal , which is the first british to achieve this height of the rowing woman combination .
they have maintained a 39 unbeaten record , with the absolute advantage .
what we see is that the two talented athletes are graceful on the water , but that &apos;s not the whole of the victory .
in the back of each row of gold medals there are many people who volunteer to help , it is their constant dedication to create a different , which help the biggest one than 30 months ago that they are suffering from cancer , do not know whether they can live to see the day coach .
as he said , death may come at any time .
i am suffering from bladder cancer , they do surgery for me .
if you do not do surgery , cancer cells will spread to the body .
in this way , the situation will be much worse .
this will slightly change your mind .
williams was diagnosed with cancer in december 2013 .
fortunately , he started treatment in early 2014 , minimizing the impact , although in this case it may not be appropriate .
i need to get the wages , so i must get better .
it was an incentive for me .
i live in the hospital , although they say that walking a few steps is enough , but i still walk around the ward 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet .
this is the starting point for everything .
the rowing movement itself is a journey , which makes this journey a little longer .
at the moment of the gold medal , they first thought of williams , and this morning williams was slightly more talkative than usual , in order to overcome his anxiety .
&quot; i am in a bad mood this week , and it may be a bit extreme , but it &apos; s really amazing , &quot; said steinning , who was the captain of the royal artillery corps , who went to afghanistan .
it repeatedly told me how important it was for me , how much effort i , helen and robin paid .
it was helen , robin and i worked hard for three years .
if there is no robin , we are just nameless , very grateful to him , he is the world &apos;s best coach .
i can not find a better trainer and coach than him .
helen graff and heather steinning failed in five years .
this combination of punishment is set by their opponents can not match .
even at the last 500 meters , new zealand and the danish team began to approach , steinning and graf still have a lot of physical reserves .
was really thrilling .
helen cried : &quot; keep the rhythm and keep the rhythm &quot; .
not affected by the opponent is indeed very important .
we have a good start , and we are not looking forward to doing what earth-shattering events .
we did not think about the glory of today , we just wanted to draw every paddle and win the game , and we did it .
this combination took a year to decide their own future .
graves will be married to tv explorer steve bachshar next month .
but now , she just want to enjoy the moment .
i do not want to say that this is my last game .
it will bring me too much pressure .
in london , it took me about six months to realize that i was the olympic champion .
this is a new experience , and i feel very nervous .
it has been about four minutes now .
she said , &quot; i feel much better . &quot;

snapchat &apos;s &quot; anime &quot; effect is accused of satirizing asians
snapchat said the filter was inspired by anime , but some observers thought it was racial .
snapchat &apos;s 150 million day-to-day users can change their reality through their filter tools and make their faces funny .
you can turn yourself into a pineapple , a dog or a role in roy lichtenstein .
these lenses have the effect of passivation , bending characteristics , resulting in more than 30 million a day after the modified self-timer .
any mistakes will be immediately noticed by the public .
snapchat lens has been criticized , the application was accused of playing black or white skin for the united states .
therefore , when the application this week for some users to provide a can create squint , strange teeth and powder effect of the filter , some critics call it the asian &quot; yellow &quot; racial satire .
they even think that these recurring problems mean that the company in the diversity of the existence of a larger problem .
after snapchat said it removed the feature , the report on wednesday the verge and motherboard raises public outrage .
the company &apos;s explanation is that the filter is a tribute to the role of anime , rather than satirical asians .
but for those who have experienced racist observers , the filter reminds them of the reality of a nuisance stereotypes .
others are also firmly opposed to these cartoon images .
a korean-american artist who has published twitter and widely shared with these photographs said in an e-mail that &quot; these filters are at least &quot; uncomfortable and uncomfortable &quot; .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to distinguish between extremely disgusting asian satirical images and filters , &quot; she said .
although the filter is not just yellow , but the yellow people are extremely belittle .
snapchat is not the only company that touches these cultural bottom lines .
from the company &apos;s board of directors to hollywood and the equipment we carry , american culture seems to have been promoting diversity and inclusiveness .
snapchat &apos;s huge young group may be very sensitive because it is more focused on racial diversity than the older generation .
when snapchat &apos;s filter produced an image of insulting the user , 25-year-old zhu kaidi said in an interview on thursday : &quot; compared to the past , such things are more difficult to escape people &apos;s attention . &quot;
on thursday , ms. zhu , who served as product manager and engineer in medium , decided to remove her snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same .
in an article written for medium and a telephone interview , she said she thought racial controversy reflected snapchat &apos;s lack of racial diversity in the recruitment process .
ms. zhu criticized most of the company &apos;s employees for the white , the leadership of all men and at the end of the article with a tag : # deletesnapchat .
as a chinese american , ms. zhu said : &quot; either their employees do not have a variety of people , so to make such a decision , or their employees have some colored people , but their position can not let them speak their minds .
other observers shared the complaints she had not been responded to by snapchat .
the company has not released data on employee diversity and says it is a private company .
on thursday , snapchat declined to discuss the racial background of its employees , but a spokeswoman said the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on the low proportion of people and to promote internal inclusiveness .
ms. zhu said she would close her snapchat account : &quot; i want to know if they need more users like us against this behavior . &quot;
the congressional group said military officials distorted isis intelligence
a congressional group said in a report released thursday that officials of the us central command have changed the intelligence report to describe the war situation in iraq and syria against the islamic countries more optimistic than the actual situation .
the interim report came from a special working group formed by the house of representatives military commission , the intelligence committee and the house of representatives national defense subcommittee of the national defense subcommittee , which reported that the central command intelligence analyst had &quot; widespread dissatisfaction &quot; and that the superiors were tampering with their assessment of the war between the united states and the islamic countries .
the central headquarters in tampa , fla . , is the military headquarters responsible for overseeing us military operations in the middle east and central asia .
according to a report on the report , &quot; the information reviewed by senior leaders of the central command is more optimistic about the us anti - terrorism action than the actual situation and is always more optimistic than the analysis of other intelligence agencies .
&quot; the command of the central command is unacceptable , &quot; said the republican representative of the california republic . &quot; one side is our warriors suffering from war and the other side is the top management policymer who receives the wrong analysis . &quot;
the leadership issue of the central command has been extended to the top of the agency .
the report details the long-standing problems of the central command in 2014 and 2015 in describing and analyzing the us training of iraqi troops .
while there is no definitive evidence that senior officials of the obama administration have ordered the change of these reports , according to the report , these analysts feel that they are under pressure from leaders of the central command to force them to express their optimism about the threat of isis or isil .
&quot; in the first half of 2015 , many central headquarters press releases , statements and congressional testimonies are much more optimistic than the actual situation , &quot; the report said .
for example , a central headquarters official said publicly that it could take a major military action in april or may 2015 to recapture mosul .
mosul , the second largest city in iraq , is still under the control of the islamic state .
&quot; after a few months of investigation , this result is already evident , &quot; kansas republican representative mike pompio said in a statement .
from mid-2014 to mid-2015 , most of the high-level intelligence officers of the us central command took control of the headquarters &apos;s intelligence products and concealed the threat of iraqi islamic states .
the republican party set up a special working group after informing the analyst about the information about the islamic state .
as the survey continues , there will be more discoveries after the report released on thursday .
the attorney general of the department of defense also conducted a long-term investigation of the central command .
the democrats &apos; members of the house intelligence committee announced their findings on thursday , in line with some of the conclusions of the republican special working group .
&quot; in the period from 2014 to 2015 , the central command has developed a too narrow process for the intelligence assessment of the islamic countries and the iraqi peacekeeping force , &quot; said the democratic party leader , xie anda , in a statement .
mr. xie said that the process &quot; hindered the release of intelligence &quot; , reduced the morale of the analyst and &quot; could not accept different opinions . &quot;
but mr. anderson and the democrats also said they did not find any evidence to prove that the white house tried to put pressure on the central command analyst , so that their conclusions were in line with &quot; presuppositions or political narratives . &quot;
the beast daily reported on tuesday the preliminary results of the congressional investigation .
last august , the new york times reported that the pentagon attorney general began investigating after receiving complaints from the central command analyst .
pentagon spokesman navy major patrick evans said in a statement that the defense department did not comment on the congressional report until the attorney general &apos;s investigation was over .
&quot; experts sometimes disagree about the interpretation of complex data , and intelligence agencies and the department of defense encourage a healthy dialogue on these important national security themes , &quot; he said .
the impact of the survey has surpassed the success of the us-led bombing operations in iraq and syria ( more and more defense officials have claimed ) the success of this issue .
but last year , these claims led the public to question the extent to which president obama could trust the military operations assessment of iraq , afghanistan , libya and other crisis areas issued by the central command .
critics of islamist intelligence were reminiscent of controversy over a decade ago when gregory hooker , the intelligence officer of the central command , wrote a research article stating that george bush &apos;s government , despite numerous analysts &apos; opposition , insisted on sending small-scale troops to iraq and hardly taking into account the 2003 invasion .
mr. hooke played a key role in this opposition to islamist intelligence .
last year , some officials said mr. hook &apos;s team had concluded that the air strikes against islamic oil refineries had not drastically reduced the economic income of terrorist organizations because the terrorist organization had built temporary refineries to continue selling oil on the black market , which was very different from the announcement .
according to &quot; time magazine &quot; reported in september , the central command did not announce the discovery .
the central command commander lloyd austin iii was criticized last year when lawyers reviewed the senate testimonies that had made an overly optimistic assessment of the war .
general austin retired in april and is currently being replaced by joseph walter in his position at the central command .
the united states in the women &apos;s hockey game won four straight , will be the final outcome with the british
in the 6 to 1 victory over japan in the game alone in the ternary katie bam on thursday for the american women &apos;s hockey team scored twice to help the us team to 3 to 0 victory over india .
two games five goals called scare four , but 27-year-old bam said she did not know that they have such a good performance .
&quot; i do not know anything about that , &quot; she said .
i am not the kind of person who will remember myself to enter a few balls .
what she knows is that the us team has won four straight victories in the olympic games and will compete with the team in the group on thursday to 2-0 victory over the japanese team after the defeat of the british team for the first team .
britain and the united states in the first round of the last round of saturday in a narrow match .
both teams are qualifying for the quarter-finals , and the game will decide who will appear as a group first .
the team will be the first team to avoid a strong dutch team , which can go further . dutch team to another group first identity .
in the saturday game , the us team created a miracle with amazing performance , knowing that at four years ago at the london olympics , the us team bottomed out in 12 teams .
bam was also in the team at that time .
bum grew up in brewer , pennsylvania , and at the age of three , he picked up the hockey stick ( her twin sister engaged in the sport in drexel ) and joined the national team at the age of 16 , becoming the youngest national team member to date .
she missed the 2008 olympic games because she was not selected for the final list .
in 2012 , she and her teammates are not optimistic .
the second year , the british craig panam served as head coach , everything began to change .
&quot; it &apos;s a culture , a mentality and a real change , &quot; bam said .
we were not in london at the current level .
we came to a thorough turn over .
thursday night , bam in the first half with a close shot back to the first shot .
india in the current game has not yet won the victory , but the team showed a staggering tenacious fighting spirit and 1 to 0 to maintain the score until the end of the third quarter , then bum broke out .
she dribbled along the left side of the stadium long raid , then cut into the middle , pumping into the net , the us team 2 to 0 lead .
melissa gonzalez scored the last ball in the middle of the fourth quarter .
us goalkeeper jackie briggs in the tournament for the first time zero closure of the opponent , in the first three victories , the opponent into a ball .
this time she is extraordinary play .
bam is also .
panam said : &quot; we are in a very good state . &quot; but how good it depends on the results of the saturday game .
&quot; sweet meal &quot; in the great depression during the shabby food
in march 1933 , franklin delano roosevelt , who had just been elected president , was sitting in the presidential office for lunch .
as a gourmet , president roosevelt liked the food of the fifth avenue , such as foie gras and maryland stewed fish .
that day , his menu is very simple : tomato sauce devil eggs , mashed potatoes and as a dim sum of pudding .
&quot; it is for the sake of food and suffering with the people who are suffering , &quot; said jane siegman .
her husband , andrew , added , &quot; it also reflects the american diet . &quot;
the couples living in the brooklyn highlands are food historians .
mr. ke &apos;s previous book , &quot; fried chicken &quot; , is about american food , and ms. siegman tells her story about the lives of slumers in her &quot; 97 orchard &quot; book .
they will be published in the new book &quot; rich meal &quot; will be published on tuesday by harper press , this book describes the great depression during the american food history .
after a common view of food , they met a journalist at eisenberg &apos;s sandwich shop , a simple lunch counter in the iron area that has been in business since 1929 .
54-year-old ms. zigman ordered a butter cheese with a broken olive sandwich , while the 57-year-old mr. had a turkey , mashed potatoes and vegetable platter .
the reporter ordered a baking meat roll , the couple thought the dishes were suitable for discussing the diet of the great depression .
&quot; when bread was very popular , &quot; said ms. siegman .
at that time there were peanut bread , liver bread , soybean bread .
they are made of a raw material and a canned poured on the raw material .
imagine your dinner is peanuts .
mr. ke played a strange phase .
&quot; they are like lead in your stomach , &quot; he said .
in the years before the great depression , americans dayton were buffet , especially in the suburbs .
a group of women for male farm workers cooking , breakfast , lunch and dinner have just come out of the pie .
in the first world war , it was the americans who sent food to the hungry europeans , and the &quot; rich feast &quot; recorded how the country was suddenly no longer a rich place .
mr. ke explained why he and his wife wrote this book : &quot; at that time , food has become the main topic that makes americans feel unhappy . &quot;
another unpleasant topic is shabby new food : bread and stew and other &quot; fans of food &quot; has become the main course , stew is &quot; the best leftovers cooking way , &quot; ms. siegman said , this is because the chefs can use the butter in the sauce to cover the unpalatable ingredients .
fresh fruit is replaced by cheap dried fruit .
the meat that has been the protagonist of the american table for many years has become a rare luxury .
strange hodgepodge only consider calories , than the taste , and even the basic cooking common sense , people first consider is nutrition .
in the course of studying the book , including the various recipes , ms. siegman produced a roasted onion with peanut oil .
&quot; it &apos; s not common at dinner tables , &quot; said mr .
ms. zigman said : &quot; this is too strange . &quot;
peanut oil and baked onions simply can not match .
this is the characteristic of many family economic meals .
family economists have influenced the country &apos;s eating habits , such as louis stanley , who was the chef of the federal family economic council from 1923 to 1943 , which is historically unique .
they publish recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , encourage women to &quot; plan &quot; and have the courage to make creamy pasta with carrots and other bad food into food .
&quot; rich meal &quot; is a rich &quot; historical jane taste &quot; .
what is particularly interesting is the government &apos;s response to the hungry people , such as the president of the public herbert hoover &quot; i can not manage the attitude of others . &quot;
although he publicly praised the childhood iowa farmhouse , but his diet is like a millionaire general fine .
mr. ke said : &quot; he likes to eat european-style western food , such as fish with cucumber sauce . &quot;
he dressed in an evening dress and dined in a gilded restaurant .
he is clearly out of the people .
if not his wife eleanor encouraged him to set an example on the diet , president roosevelt might have made the same mistake .
as the book says , the steward employed by ms. roosevelt has no interest in the taste , so the food in the white house is not only the most unpalatable food in washington , but also the worst food for cooking .
when the united states returned to the formal , many of the great depression of the cooking method was abandoned .
ms. zigman said that what we left was our focus on calories and nutrition and applied science to cooking .
the couple said that when they wrote this book , they learned more about ms. ziegman &apos;s mother &apos;s eating habits , such as how she did not discard food .
&quot; she was very scared of wasting food , &quot; said mr. ke .
&quot; she actually makes a lot of people sick , &quot; ms. zigman recalled .
such as had happened with the &quot; cream puff &quot; event .
after removing the plate , she and her husband took out a dessert prepared at home : it was the fruit pudding that president roosevelt had eaten at lunch .
ms. zigman said : &quot; this is called creamy preserved fruit , &quot; and added to a common dish from a trendy name is &quot; the usual trick . &quot;
there is no raw cream in this dessert , only preserved fruit , a little flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone reluctantly sprays the deep sticky brown paste .
surprisingly , the taste of this dessert is not bad .
mr. ke and eat the second spoon , the third spoon .
he felt that it was an affordable dessert , and told his wife , &quot; it &apos; s better to add a broken walnut .

the last meeting of the oil-producing countries was already a matter of april , and opec member states failed to reach agreement on any measures .

helima croft , head of commodity strategy at royal bank of canada , said opec changed the market sentiment by releasing signals that they would make an agreement .
this means like a smoke and a mirror that draws people &apos;s attention ( meaning the wrong impression ) .
eugen weinberg , director of commodity research at the german commercial bank , said the possibility of opec trying to stabilize the market through the september meeting was low .
this is likely to further undermine the confidence of the market opec , after all , this organization staged a &quot; wolf &quot; .

scottish cyclist karl skinner won the bike gold medal
scottish cyclist karl skinner last night at the rio cycling team men &apos;s group racing to help the british trio succeed in defending the olympic gold medal after the 2012 london olympics .
the 23-year-old glasgow bike replaced his scottish compatriots , sir chris hoy , as the backbone of the team , and the legendary cyclist was proud of when the young skinner defeated and won the new zealand team .
four years ago , the british team blockbuster , and hoy won the individual six olympic gold medal in the fifth block .
the british team was only sixth in the world cycling championships in london in march , and hoy retired from then on .
during the beijing olympic games to the london olympics , the british team &apos;s problem is to replace the &quot; first lap expert &quot; jamie stav .
the team did it when sinders appeared .
hoy &apos;s retired also left a blank , and chien imadi and matt krampton wanted to fill the gap .
after seeing the potential of skinner , the british men &apos;s team coaching team insisted that he was selected for the national team , and skinner eventually live up to expectations .
skinner &apos;s partner was hinders and kenny , who won the gold medal four years ago with hoye , who had set a record for the olympic games in qualifying , but the results were surpassed by the new zealand team in the first round .
and the three british cycling final defeated opponents , won the gold medal .
although sinders was slightly behind , but kenny was the team leader , skinner held the lead to the end .
strategic change is the key to this reversal , sinders chose the larger flywheel , so the speed is slower , and this allows kenny , especially skinner to keep pace .
hoye watched the game as a bbc commentator , and skinner , kenny and sinders saw him at the podium .
23 - year - old glasgow bike player skinner said : &quot; it makes me flattered .
i just do my best to make myself famous .
we created the olympic record in the final and beat the world championship .
it &apos;s so incredible .
nothing is better than this victory .
after winning the gold medal with kenny and hoya at the london olympics in 2012 , sinders admitted to deliberately dropping on the track in poor start .
later , he withdrew the comments , and the british team &apos;s opponents can not appeal .
and this victory does not have any such problems .
&quot; it &apos;s like london , and the platform is the british flag , &quot; sinders said .
we just teamed up three months ago .
we have lost a lot of world championships , so it is amazing to be able to defend the olympic championship .
which is only in the beijing olympic games and the london olympic games won 10 venues in the gold medal in the seven teams of the british team is just a game , a gold medal only .
if this symbolizes the progress we have made over the past five months , we will continue to be successful in the bike hall in the next five days .
according to kenny show the state , he is not impossible to reproduce hoy in the olympic games won three gold medal feat .
if that was the case , it was 12 years younger than hoyo and also on march 23 ( the day seemed to be the sacred days of british sports , steve redgrave , mo farah and roger bannister were born on that day ) . kenny would have six gold medals and one silver medal .
this is the same as hoye .
kenny will play the next day , a three-day race .
the 28-year-old bolton said : &quot; i will focus on this game for the time being .
the team is always the best .
you can win the match with your teammates .
to be frank , a person wins a little lonely .
&quot; if he can win another two gold medals , he should be awarded the jazz title , &quot; said sinders .
it was the only game of the day , but the british team received other good news .

china &apos;s capacity utilization in recent years are higher than the global average , but also higher than the united states and europe and other countries and regions .
china has taken resolute and effective measures to resolve excess capacity , and the results are gradually emerging .
the official pointed out that the steel overcapacity of the global problem , the cpc central committee and state council attaches great importance .
all departments and regions actively implement the deployment of the state council , earnestly carry out the work , this year to reduce crude steel production capacity of 45 million tons .
from china &apos;s national conditions , china does not encourage steel exports , on the contrary , also take a series of practical measures to control steel exports .

some enterprises do not meet the changes in the market environment , production and management is difficult or even on the brink of collapse , but by some institutional factors , to market the way to withdraw more obstacles to become a &quot; zombie enterprise . &quot;
the existence of such enterprises , distorted the market signal , reducing the use of factor resources efficiency , increased social management costs , hinder the fair competition in the establishment of the market environment .
the main reason for the loss is the same as the dilemma faced by the global steel industry - weak market demand and low utilization rate .
china mainly adopts the market mechanism , economic means and the rule of law , the government is mainly to do the work of workers and social stability , to ensure fair and equitable market order .

the future of the portland smelter is filled with uncertainty due to the cancellation of the power supply contract
the hundreds of workers at the portland aluminum smelters in victoria and the factories are currently facing an uncertain future , as a result of a plant-powered power company that revealed that a plant owner would terminate a supply contract that would invalidate all supply contracts .
the move took place after the victorian government decided not to continue to pay subsidies to ensure factory operations .
the 20-year fixed subsidy will end in november .
alcoa &apos;s portland plant &apos;s 2,000 workers may face unemployment .
once the factory is closed , there may be as many as 2,000 people directly or indirectly unemployed .
and because the plant &apos;s electricity consumption accounts for about 10 % of all the power output of victoria , it may also produce a chain reaction .
in 2014 , alcoa closed the hanrui angle smelter , which led to the closure of last year &apos;s anglesey power plant .
alcoa portland smelters are currently losing money and facing the risk of closing .
the move was made after the factory &apos;s forecast for the next few years , initially due to the strength of the australian dollar , which was recently due to the price of the factory product .
agl supplies power to the large aluminum smelter through the lao lubu valley old eve power plant , which predicts that three other plant owners will also terminate their agreement .
the largest shareholder of the plant is a joint venture between alcoa and alumina , while china &apos;s citic group and japan &apos;s marubeni co . , ltd. also hold a small stake .
&quot; the agl expects the portland plant to continue operating , meaning that the smelter will continue to generate electricity demand , &quot; the joint venture said .
agl said the contracts were &quot; hedging contracts &quot; that should have been in effect since november 2016 .
the termination of the contract is 12 months , so they will end in 2017 .
&quot; therefore , agl is still predicting that these contracts will continue to generate revenue in the 2017 fiscal year , &quot; the power company said .
the effect of any income that agl may have incurred since the fiscal year 2018 is currently being optimistic about the wholesale price of the futures market .
agl said the company has downgraded the $ 187 million contract value in the &quot; termination event expectations &quot; .
alcoa said it was decided to terminate these contracts &quot; will not affect alcoa &apos;s ability to operate the smelter or to ensure that the smelter &apos;s power supply . &quot;
the us company said it signed a 20-year contract with laoya in 2010 , which would have been in effect in november , but the company did not explain why it had withdrawn from the contract .
analysts are cautious about whether the portland smelters in victoria and the tolgoo facility near newcastle will be shut down because of the bad economic situation in the industry .
commenting on analysts &apos; comments earlier this week , agl operations director steven mickelson said portland &apos;s annual electricity consumption reached about 600 megawatts and the tommage plant reached about 900 megawatts .
if the two factories are closed , the demand for the electricity market will be greatly reduced .
he said : &quot; as a power company , which for us is not a good news . &quot;
the community law center shuts out 160,000 people each year
more than 160,000 of the most vulnerable groups are shut out by community law centers each year , and the funds for this service are already stretched , and now face further funding cuts .
in queensland , three out of every five people were rejected while seeking free legal advice and agency services , most of them elderly , immigrant , disadvantaged workers , victims of violent incidents and those who did not have the resources to fight unfair expulsion .
the lack of funding for community legal services has already exceeded the limit and is now facing further funding cuts .
since june next year , the federal government for these legal centers to provide funds will be reduced by 30 % .
queensland community law center head james farrell said that according to the latest national community association law center investigation report , every year thousands of people were shut out .
mr. farrell said that if the federal government does not change the existing decision , this situation will only get worse .
&quot; queensland &apos;s community law center has long been underfunded , which means that thousands of people will not be able to get the services they need , &quot; he said .
people who need to stay away from violence , who bear huge debts that can not be repaid , are faced with disintegrated families , squeezed workers , who face legal problems , and the report shows that they can not get the help they need .
the federal government will cut its funds by 30 per cent since june 2017 , which means that thousands of vulnerable groups in queensland will be forced to face complex legal problems without help .
we call on the minister of justice and queensland member of parliament , george brandeis , to immediately withdraw these cuts , so that people can get the help they need in the face of legal issues .
last year , the state government promised to raise legal aid funds to the national average .
it is now necessary to focus on the needs of community law centers and their corresponding communities , and the white levine government must also be involved in this important work .

britain must convey the olympic spirit and expand the heathrow airport
heathrow will also bring vitality and prosperity to our community , london and the whole country .
for me , this is the charm of heathrow , as in the 2012 london olympics , we make every effort to ensure that our country and region can benefit from these events .
the olympic games benefited stratford and east .
and we will benefit the region by creating opportunities for local people and businesses around heathrow .
for our local community alone , we will create 10,000 new apprenticeships , 40,000 new jobs and free young people around the airport from unemployment .
as before the london 2012 olympic games , some people think that heathrow &apos;s expansion project is too large .
i was told that the uk would not be ready for the olympics and we would be ashamed of the world .
the skeptics of the 2012 olympic games are wrong , and their doubts about the heathrow project will prove to be wrong .
although there will always be obstacles to overcome , but heathrow is solving every problem facing .
like the olympics , heathrow is an infrastructure project for most people , not a few people .
the expansion project will create as many as 180,000 new jobs , bringing 211 billion pounds of economic growth , leaving a technology and employment wealth around the airport and across the uk .
we have an excellent heathrow project team that has completed a £ 11 billion infrastructure investment project on time and within budget , including the t5 terminal , which is the world &apos;s premier airport terminal for five consecutive years , and the t2 terminal between two of the world &apos;s busiest runways .
now , they are preparing to build a third runway with a £ 16bn private investment .
britain successfully held the 2012 london olympics , and i believe heathrow airport expansion project will also be a great success .
it is time for us to convey the olympic spirit and to expand heathrow &apos;s airport so that we can escort our future and create a technology and wealth that makes the united kingdom proud of it .
lord paul dayton is the chairman of the heathrow airport board of directors and former uk treasury counselor

nasa climate model : venus was suitable for human habitation
according to nasa &apos;s new climate model , venus was suitable for human habitation .
scientists at the nasa goddard space institute have developed a model that explores the situation of venus , which uses tools and algorithms that are very similar to those used by climate scientists .
the model is used to determine whether the surface is hot , anhydrous and the atmosphere is full of carbon dioxide , venus has been similar to the earth &apos;s environment .
previously , scientists believe that venus rotation is slower because of its thicker atmosphere .
but the latest simulation shows that venus may have a thinner , similar to the earth &apos;s atmosphere and the same speed of rotation at the same time .
the model also shows venus &apos;s early terrain .
venus &apos;s dry areas may be more than the earth , but there was enough water and geographical changes to nurture life and prevent rapid evaporation .
early , the sun exposure on venus was 30 % darker than the earth .
&quot; in the modeling of the goddard space institute , venus &apos; s slow rotation allowed one side of the day to last for nearly two months , &quot; explained anthony del jenio , a scientist at the goddard space institute scientist at a news conference .
this causes the surface to warm up and produce rainwater that can form thick clouds , and the thick clouds are like an umbrella that blocks the heat of most of the sun for the ground .
the result of the simulation is that venus &apos;s average climate temperature is actually several degrees lower than the present earth .
the model simulates venus evolution similar to that of planetary scientists .
although venus may have been living , but in the course of billions of years , venus exposed to high temperatures and ultraviolet light .
the oceans on the planet evaporate and the water vapor is burned by ultraviolet rays .
with the escape of hydrogen , leaving only a thicker carbon dioxide atmosphere and fatal greenhouse gas effects , which formed today we know venus .
researchers in the &quot; geophysical research newsletter &quot; published a new venus climate model simulation results .

&quot; in the north sea and the country as a whole , we need an economy that serves most people , not the minority , &quot; dave said in a statement .
in 2016 , the north sea project is expected to spend less than $ 1.4 billion in new projects , while the average expenditure for the past five years is about $ 7 billion .
kepler measures the rotation speed of the stellar stars
the new mission of the kepler space telescope helped astronomers to capture the most complete pleistocene star rotation speed .
the new data is helping astronomers understand why stars of the cluster have different rotational speeds and the rotation cycle associated with the planet .
&quot; we would like to compare our results with other clusters to further understand the relationship between star quality , age , and even the history of the solar system , &quot; said lusa rebel , a research scientist at the california institute of technology &apos;s infrared processing analysis center at the press conference .
pleasant cluster is 445 light years from earth .
many of the stars in the cluster were born about 125 million years ago and are now only in adulthood .
they reached the highest speed of rotation in their lives .
at the highest speed of rotation , these mature stars emit a lot of stellar winds .
when these stars wind through the stars of the magnetic field , they will brake the stars .
with the increase in the age of stars , the rotation speed began to slow down .
kepler measures the rotation speed of each star by tracking the time at which the recognizable stellar sunspots ( like sunspots ) occur .
the latest rotation speed data set indicates that the mass of the larger stars is slower than the slower mass of the stars .
rebel compares a star to a dancer , and a larger dancer rotates slower than a smaller dancer .
&quot; in the &apos; ballet show &apos; of the pleiades , we found that stars with slower rotation are often of higher quality , and the fastest moving stars are often the lightest stars .
due to the close distance of the pleiades , it can be used as an ideal cosmic laboratory for comparing star mass and rotation speed .
&quot; the pleiades have laid the foundations for the theoretical model of the two - way rotation of young and old stars .
there are still a lot of knowledge about how stars , when and why they slow down the speed and &quot; put away their own shoes &quot; .
rebel and her colleagues elaborated on their latest analysis of the speed of the pleiocene cluster in three new papers , which will soon be published in the journal astronomy .
