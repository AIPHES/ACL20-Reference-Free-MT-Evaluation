russia and turkey : a &apos; uyumsuzlar in alliance ?
this is a crisis jestti sonlandıran .
russia and turkey &apos;s leaders on tuesday , the seizure of words and economic sanctions and later appearing wasting eight months of the war , officially sonlandırıldığını variation around the world .
however , vladimir putin &apos;s st. petersburg palace of the turkish mevkidaşını selamlarken glitzy hall this reconciliation , the more they want , ankara is obvious that he had a life .
al sıkışıldı , yes .
however , mr putin &apos;s gülümsemesi zayıftı quite limited its own standards , and even against the sidewalk to tell any kind of temperature .
by contrast , recep tayyip erdogan repeatedly &quot; good friend &quot; mr putin talked about ; from five times , according to a report .
i am the number .
he also said russia &apos;s relationship with the pre-crisis level of not complying with the very most senior levels , so that it doesn &apos;t promise ulaşacağının .
the next day a newspaper here , mr. erdogan &apos;s never a bad thing like it , it was safe .
i think that he also filled up that it was the opposite .
however , mr putin &apos;s shooting and interview with the russian leader , not create cold did nothing .
in fact , in a statement at the opening of the crisis , it was the first thing mentioned : turkey &apos;s border with syria , a russian military plane shot breaks out .
then , russia &apos;s reaction to the hiddet were everywhere .
mr putin , a sharp exit was supposed to ankara to moscow at the expense of bıçaklamakla accused .
kırgınlık much older than that , against the sides seemed friendly .
real rebuilding the trust will be hard , perhaps impossible .
since november , the idea of the people of russia has changed .
the state controlled by the media after months of staggering and aggressive in a way that ankara has been going .
turks aniden , everything was a criminal .
is this the ciddileri , senior stewards , mr. erdogan &apos;s family in syria , the so-called islamic state carried out in areas under the control of the illegal oil trade with the claim that suçlamalardı make a profit .
he has flatly rejected it .
however , official reports from st. petersburg , the message was that it is time to move on .
the reason is that this meeting nihayetinde , mr. putin &apos;s president erdogan demanded the apology he received from the states .
russia may feel it a kind of victory .
the call for a ceasefire for ankara , very clear benefits .
first , erdogan &apos;s meeting last month , and almost brought them , which will be needed after the failed coup dostlara .
in turkey renewed terror attacks he feels quite at home .
in addition , effective economic reasons .
the sanctions imposed by russia &apos;s hard hit ; especially in each year of turkey &apos;s coastal regions of several million russian tourists carry ban private flights .
this number fell by almost 90 % .
in russia , tour operators and leasing companies will be scheduled flights will continue to be associated with ease .
at the end of the season in the mediterranean will rely on their faces .
and this week , state tv , turkish agricultural products ithalatlarına again be allowed to decline in the price of fruit and vegetables with the predicted .
i started at a vedemosti quote we will be there , &quot; turistler domatesler here . &quot;
however , the visit to moscow in the political value of a separate houses .
a failed coup , ankara &apos;s reaction may have been enough for angry towards the west .
in the united states on the issue of talks salyangoz prompted the pace for a long time , added to his anger at turkey &apos;s ties with the west and with soğukluktan kopmasından who want to benefit from mr. putin &apos;s attendance .
the russian leader a coup after an elected officials called for the promotion of sympathy from ankara is certainly due to appear on the right .
unutmamak , he will himself has been undergoing a regime change on moscow for fear of carrying this inevitably tutumdu .
on the coast the glitzy ceremony , this summit , russia and turkey , to me they are a way of announcing a &quot; uyumsuzlar alliance are &quot; : from the west , and the worst has been rejected by the two countries joining forces around the globe .
however , despite the display of this görüntüsüne played a key role , is on the box .
one of the most important of them about syria : moscow itself as a mediator although russia and turkey supporting different parties .
almost three hours after the talks , head of the first two , but focused on the issue of a press conference explaining that they support it .
turkey &apos;s president , these differences related to a question , mr. putin has made clear that it tried to avoid stressing çizmeyi chose them .
common ground in syria that will be clear on how there is no consensus .
for months , however , it is clear that the ongoing husumetten after nato member turkey - and by the russian military plane shot düşürmesiyle created an absolute disaster , the potential for knowing that - at least for the two leaders to talk to begin is certainly a good development .
the royal bank of scotland , there is no reference to customers outside of scotland
according to the head of the executive board of bank beyanına emerging brand , will take over the post office in the background .
the royal bank of scotland for customers outside of scotland , will be destroyed .
bbc scotland &apos;s ross mcewan , rbs , or the bank &apos;s brand of global targets to be associated with other countries .
almost eight years ago , among them the target of the aryan batma back off and give up too much in the case .
but during this brand strategists in other consumer financial brands in order to protect the emerging economies .
this is the six ulus rugby championship wimbledon champion andy murray to the many millions of sponsorship for the pound was supported with .
now , however , more national brands that was given the right to decide who comes up .
the royal bank of scotland scottish clients , however , will not be used by the new twists .
england and wales at the centre and on the outside of their litigation that &quot; all efforts to rbs natwest as atıflar change .
the republic of ireland and northern ireland in the ulster bank customers already for the brand in the world .
the dominant banking for the individual mandate will take over much more of a smaller brands in the present ; adam coutts &amp; co , drummond , and holt &apos;s military bank .
mr mcewan in inverness-shire , for customers and staff held a round of interviews .
bbc scotland , said : &quot; after that , much more , from a bank that we will now emerging brand investor personelimizin authentic brand and the brand is not going to happen . &quot;
the bank itself has become a global brand , rbs became a global brand .
now it is the global , not local purposes , i say .
this , from each of the slightly different communities , where , in a way that will be available and to our customers and this will work under the name brands .
rbs six ulus , won &apos;t be sponsoring the championship on the different brands and sports sponsorluğu yükseltmekte profile had said .
the executive chairman of the board now , &quot; brands because they have time to cross the east bank ( came ) to do it for ourselves soruyorduk customers how we can do better than a bank ? &quot; he said .
three years ago the bank is great for our customers , and we will do it if we had made these brands sunacağımızı bulurdum alayvari .
however , we do , and concentrate on the needs of customers , not kendimizin with too much change i think göreceğinizi .
these brands again , that is why this sokabiliriz i think it is the right time .

according to yougov , as many mentioned plakların , an issue on which the return of a physical object created by the innovation peşindeki y generation , not a result of the middle ages nostaljisinin .
in the recent vinil buying the albums are mostly aged between 45 and 54 .

but do the results of the yougov &apos;s true ?
this blog post , in a tv news cameras , it would be , in a crowded street of modest , stands in a number of grey with a thin , many are pitching before the gesture while ellerimi after opening to unite and i &apos;d like to say to an authoritarian : &quot; then to follow the one given atalım . &quot;
at the time , a given atalım .
slowly , in the centre of the unusual and affected by the release of the büyüsünü ( once , where the buildings are now independent retailers , hotels , eats paperchases prets and filled with ) are still a few specialist shops in the current record .
probably next , i would like to stand for some of the great kameradan ; it is a sign of the close monitoring of men of different ages to get through and you just learn about emotional situations .
( sister ray from the census data : the two young women , three middle-aged man ) reckless records ( data for the census : eight middle-aged men , probably on his , the old woman ) while i follow stuart glasgowlu ( 55 ) , for a meeting in london , spent the afternoon treat , and a few trial to fill empty shops is taking into account .
he asked whether i was a collector .
&quot; i think öyleyim , &quot; she says .
about 3,000 or 4,000 plağa i have .
that is above the official plaklar ( official told me in an e-mail , sent him home so i never followed ) at the same time the walls of rooms of the residence .
so many albums and singles toplamasının reason for disposable income , partly a result of ; now the first when the money and can afford plakları in times and encouraging young people to buy a return to trading .
&quot; most of what aldığım 60 in the room at the beginning of the end of the 1970s , when she was 11 or 12 , i opposed things ; olduklarım too young to buy , &quot; he said .

some enthusiasts said the digital world bunalmış vinil again calm , recalling memories of youth , and the familiar record kapaklarının can take refuge in its stability .
he says that &quot; sometimes wez ; the reason for this is a void to fill or in the material objects may be seen as a kind of comfort . &quot;
i &apos;ve given it a collector olduğumdan there and i think it is also slower than most .
this is an easy way to fill kafanızı .

as much as the protagonist kürekleri teknede even though two people ; there was the sound of the three couples in the race this year , women in the uk , such as the first group of women to a higher level for the second successive gold olympic medal in the process ... robin williams voice antrenörleri teknede yankılanıyordu also .
it was quite hakimiyetleri ; this is their unprecedented , most yenilmezlik 39th in the series .
we , as a surface süzülen zarafetinde two wonderful athletes will look like this does not reflect the full nature of the win .
each rowing gold madalyasının artımlı behind it , that makes the gains that we have a team of willing ellerden and no hands , 30 months ago she was diagnosed with cancer it won &apos;t live on as needed until it was announced antrenörleri were not effective .
and , just as its dokundular left .
ameliyatla yakalandım mesane types which can interfere with cancer and did so .
if it goes , everywhere .
this would be a very bad situation .
this is implemented bakışınızı slightly to change .
williams for the december 2013 identified as saying .
he is at the start of the 2014 season , with the exception of three , very fortunate for başlayabildiği treatment in such cases , it would be a true expression is protected in this way , the attention to dağınıklığı inebilecektir to a minimum .

&quot; have a few steps and hastanedeydim enough , they say , despite having 6 , 9 , 15 metres until yürüyordum .
opened in this way .
rowing to attract in its own right , but it has been a journey is a little problem .
after the victory in the minds of their own to deal with the concerns of speaking , to care a little more , which was a tense , williams was in the morning .
royal tolci topcu won in the league and the captain , who has previously gone to afghanistan , &quot; stanning , who this week emotionally destroyed durumdaydım , perhaps a little too seriously , but it means a lot , &quot; he said .
for me , that &apos;s what it means , and helen , myself and robin &apos;s a lot of stress is trying once more .
helen and robin with the three years i was wonderful .
robin without him and we are for this reason that we have the best coach in the world because it is the largest in a public want to convey to him .
are working better for a person or a better coaching bulamazdım .
helen glover and heather stanning in five years the race did not despair .
they had a tough ritim tutturmuş off-limits to their rivals .
denmark and new zealand in the last 500 metres when the struggling teams even stanning and glover &apos;s tükenmemişti force yet .
we should make the main kaptırmıştık then .
in the process , helen izle izle sesleniyordu added in the process .
kapılıp gitmemek is really important .
we had a good start , and also to do something incredible çalışmıyorduk .
today , we have not only explosive fireworks fişeklerin will have won the race to win best rowing istiyorduk what you did that .
in the future , the pair before deciding what to do in a year will break .

until now , it just wants to enjoy the moment .
this latest yarışım me to say that i didn &apos;t want to .
it &apos;s too much pressure oluşturacaktı .
in london , the difference that i &apos;m an olympic champion six ayımı i was born .

the base of the congress , the military authorities , the tahrif iŞİd İstihbaratını
in a report published on thursday by a congressional panels , the united states of america , the center for command commanders in syria , iraq and islamic state in the war against the war that a more optimistic picture of the events on the ground to point out that there are falsified intelligence reports .
it armed services committee , the intelligence committee , and defense committee subcommittee Ödeneği republican council heads , where a study prepared by a section of the report , the occasional Üstlerinin america will see the islamic state forces has changed the command centre between intelligence analysts who said &quot; it &apos;s a disappointment , &quot; found it .

the report , in a news bulletin , be established took part : &quot; a senior centcom approved by the leaders of the intelligence , the results of the united states as a typical terrorism prevention in the work of the facts on the ground that show a more positive picture çizmekte repeatedly and other elements of the intelligence community where analizlerden offers many more positive results . &quot;
their republican representative ken calvert , &quot; centcom is unacceptable ; what happened in senior decision makers to poor analysis units are going to be suffering from the fact that they were taking place . &quot;
centcom failures in leadership at the highest levels between the two companies .
the 10-page report , the central command &apos;s of america that the iraqi forces are training at the work of statement and that there is no taking part in the 2014 and 2015 in permanent problems in the details in the coup .
however , senior obama administration officials that his orders to change reports that while there was no evidence the exact analizcilerin iŞİd and daeŞ , also known as the islamic state threat , that creates a more optimistic outlook about submitting centcom açıklanmaktadır felt the pressure on the leaders .
in the first half of 2015 , &quot; the report said , many anticipated a press bulletin komut centre , congressional testimony and operational events only slightly more pozitifti guitar . &quot;
a centcom official ; for example , the state &apos;s deficit of mosul as a large military for a reversal of the attack until april or may 2015 to further could be done at a time when the early .
iraq &apos;s second largest city , mosul , and he still now manages it along with the islamic state .
in kansas , republican representative mike pompeo &apos;s declaration of a &quot; after it &apos;ll be weeks of research in a way , it is clear that the two things that seem to be &quot; . &quot;
in the middle of 2014 at the end of 2015 to the middle of the united states of america &apos;s most senior intelligence leaders komutasının centre , in iraq , the threat posed by the iŞİd irrelevant to be launched , such as the manipulation of the results of the intelligence commander .
islamic state , has appeared on the intelligence analysts raised concerns that had been manipulated after we have created a working branch .

mr. schiff , according to this process is the publication of the results of the intelligence &quot; delayed &quot; morale among analysts , and the defect led to the &quot; opposite views &quot; did not provide enough space .

the research , in iraq and in syria , america , led by the bomb attack operation will continue with the problem that he did not echo uyandıracaktır ( this is beyond any of the more official defence put forward by a savdır ) .
however , the charges were announced last year , president obama &apos;s iraq , afghanistan , libya and other parts of the crisis for military operations in the command centre for honest assessments of how or whether there have been revealed .
islamic state , centcom yansıtılmasına intelligence has been criticism that the intelligence analyst gregory hooker &apos;s president george w. bush , many analysts , despite the administration &apos;s opposition to a small force in iraq in 2003 , and advocated bulundurulmasını occupied tally was not enough , wrote an article in which he said he was not considering place and started being discussed for over a decade .
mr hooker and , at the same time , islamic state intelligence related to isyanda also played a key role in a major .
the authorities , mr. hooker &apos;s team last year , despite public statements to the contrary in the hands of the islamic state possessing rafinerilere conducted airstrikes against oil on the black market to sell the interim refineries have built a comfortable , the terrorist group &apos;s financial resources on which voting concluded that had made it .
however , the times &apos;s in september as the finding is never out of the command centre .
it was then the centcom general lloyd j. austin iii , the senate last year , many in the statement of the law of war , a very positive koyucu assessment is viewed as a criticism .

olympic hırsının dinginliği trambolin at
if you see , where , no matter how many hours the olympics continues .
events in rio de janeiro , competition and a packed with ambitions to work represents , and it was as if at all , such as not going either kaçınılamayacak .

simone biles , katie ledecky or michael phelps and chad le clos on the back and forth between television izleyemiyor something without the instructions or in the newspapers , a café komşunuzun veremiyorsunuz listen to what .
there are also dooley and logan .
for the first time at the olympics , and mr. dooley sponsorluklar öğütleyen always make you feel good tv ads between being a swimmer or gymnast , gamzeli fencer , such as a heart shot suffered a prime time earlier in the day , is one of several names could be shown .
however , the lake forest , california from mr dooley ( 28 ) at the olympics trambolinde struggles to a gold medal .

always the breaststroke , will be with us for a long time to be the &apos; .
however , as the most personal , honest belirtmem sevdiğimi trambolinin büyüsüne i would like to draw attention to the secret .
as much as the sydney games trambolin &apos;s performance since 2000 , as an olympic event is known for 16 years , even if you say it &apos;s a handful sorduğum olympic sport that it &apos;s varmamıştı .
this could be a regional ignorance .
the united states of america , the contest for the medals trambolinde sends athletes ever to 2012 in the final curve and a rising competing in the case .
in the men &apos;s awards , the chinese and the russians , the chinese and for males and eğilimindeydi &quot; to share .
dong dong from china and canada , maclennan rosie this year in london , will seek to protect their gold medals .
however , as the event site mazlum trambolin notes ; in part it is because we will not kulaklarda palyaço instead of the olympics could be judged that the school received .

of course , the challenge is not in competition , or was not , however , to achieve outcomes during routine work , a trend away from kaybolma , but just imagine the time and gravity , such as the suspension of a smooth way .
an olympic race rather than resting resting so if ever .

for a long time to the united states in ethiopia to levy protestoda &quot; &quot; in a generation
protestolar İçeren violence in ethiopia
ethiopia at the demonstrators who are calling for political change , the government has faced with violent resistance .
Şahitler , a large number of protesters killed in clashes with the police that she hits the deadly weapons .
ethiopia crumbling ?
over the past decade , africa &apos;s most stable uluslarından and one of the fastest growing economy in the western allies with a solid for the day .
however , in the last few months of anti-government protests , with every day more shook the country by creating in the region .
only last week , thousands of people on the street having requested a fundamental political change .
human rights groups , according to the government &apos;s response is pretty acımasızdı .
Şahitler , several police officers hitting and killing unarmed demonstrators , he said .
since the end of last year or the beginning of the year , which was thought to be a protest against the wall there are young people should keep their hands dayayıp kırbaçlayan seen security officers .
at the highest level , the united nations human rights official , now in a thorough review to be held .
a research group , which the international crisis group project director for somalia peninsula rashid abdi &quot; this country together to keep every time it was hard to move on , and it will be much harder , &quot; he said .
after nigeria , ethiopia , africa &apos;s population is the highest uluslarındandır and stability is appreciated by the west .
the american military and intelligence services , particularly in the region , including somalia to fight for terrorist threats and work closely with the ethiopians are conducting , and in africa , from the west this level there is very little help heal the country .
ethiopia &apos;s economy , growing by an impressive manner .
the effective iyileştirilmiştir altyapısı ; the capital , addis ababa at the even if there is a new commuter train .
and the streets are quiet , safe and temizdir usually .
ethiopia as much as the best example of democracy in sergilenmese ( and human rights groups have repeatedly referred to the government &apos;s repressive stance of opposition within the country , there are ) , it was pretty effective susturulmaktaydı opponents .
most of the exiled , jailed , killed or driven to the most remote köşelerine 3rd .
that , however , may be about to change .
central ethiopia from a university professor , &quot; teshome boğar seyoum and the deployment of the people to give them another option sunmazsanız , these events of interest &quot; . &quot;
if youth is completely protest .
a generation of protest .
land use of the governing coalition force so many complaints about the pressures imposed by the current .
last year , after the election , which has been quite the governing party and its allies , as one of the last to fill vacancies in the parliament and no longer received 100 % of the control to it .
in june , at the same time , hundreds of people were killed in the war , which led to the provocative and contentious line at the border with eritrea , and tensions are on the rise .
analysts say the oromo freedom front or the ogaden national freedom front in recent years , such as the elimination of this shield separatist groups claiming they should fear silahlanmasından türbülanstan again .
kaynamakta under the surface for years , which is why the feeling pain now patlamakta announcing there are a few factors .
seems smart phones : the first is innocent .
cheap smart phones and internet service sağlandıkça yaygınlaştıkça , only a few years ago a large number of ethiopian using social media began to establish communication .
the government has often been in protest , especially as they have access to the facebook and twitter kapattığında even if most people planned their position in the internet through servers caretaker kurabiliyordu communication .
a few young ethiopian toplandıklarını in this way for the protests , he said .
second , ethiopia &apos;s two largest ethnic group , and the solidarity between oromolar amharalar also rose .
oromolar amharalar and is not normally an ally .
for a long time , ethiopia &apos;s dominant as a christian , and the mountainous regions of amharalar policy that created most of the muslims in the building , and the flat arazilerde oromoları abuse in the first place .
but that is changing .
a leader of the oromo mulatu gemechu gather under the umbrella &quot; in a commerce to work harder , &quot; he said .
the biggest protests amhara and oromo areas .
most of the amhara , oromo and ethiopia &apos;s population , about 6 % of the residents who make and the military , intelligence services , trade and the tigrayan , dominant in policy by members of the ethnic group , were defeated in a way which is not fair .
the third reason is the underlying discontent meles zenawi was the death of .
the former leader of the rebellion in 2012 , mr. meles an undisclosed illness caused by 17 years before ethiopia &apos;s prime minister in 2001 .
everyone has to see a specialist , which was tactical .
analysts , especially as the first signs of unrest to identify and to etkisizleştirme teskin opponents and says he is an expert on .
&quot; the current conflict analyst mr. abdi do not have the knowledge it is the regime , &quot; he said .
ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , hailemariam desalegn to replace mr. meles relatively declared that he was elected to fill .
northern ethiopia &apos;s tigray region from mr. meles , in contrast to mr hailemariam güneylidir .
analysts say that he is controlled by tigrayanların says he managed to get the trust of the security services .
as a result , more fear came out with more blood .
ethiopia &apos;s this kind of confusion about the recent experience in 2005 , many thousands of people , the government built the analysts said after an election after protestosuydu theft .
Önlemlerde who follow him , how much less than last month , although many protesters were killed and that this period of turmoil in the relative as early as the second .
development experts , ethiopia &apos;s leaders , such as a new commuter train infrastructure planlamaları vision and made significant progress on fighting poverty to move on .
that , however , is the need to increase against the government of ethiopia kinin durdurmadığı open .
and this is dangerous and ethnic .
last month , a amhara , protesters in the town of gondar tigrayanların , owned businesses , and attacked the tigrayan hatred has been on the rise in social media .
the protests , analysts say , the united states and other western allies in a strange situation , she said .
america &apos;s government in neighbouring somalia , ethiopia on the unmanned aerial vehicle being used as a base for flight ; however , shortly before the closure of the base this year .
the west clearly wants to promote democracy in a region already fragile this müttefikinin also does not want to break up .
&quot; this , &quot; mr. abdi said the company was &quot; very fine a yarn as we &apos;re going on . &quot;
donald trump , the obama &apos;s iŞİd kurduğu yönündeki İddiasını alaycılık announces as &quot; &quot;
donald j. trump , on friday , a couple of times last week defended president obama and hillary clinton on the islamic state terrorist group , &quot; the founders &quot; claim that it is not serious about the latest conflict , saying that the campaign sought to eliminate .

the first of these two do bilemedim ; to be deep and widespread ones , such as a gendarmerie general commander of the 8th annual orders officer and mr president &apos;s yaverleri .
mr. president , people struggling with the most able to how the plenary yaverlerini while but they are the most important feature of the unprecedented secrecy .
two yüzlüler too .
&quot; this is like a retired vaizin fetÖ can do is not a business , &quot; says one of the most important kanıtlarından kumpas so deep it is .
it is true , is backed by the cia .
the cia , he agrees that it is too early to have taken a hand .

erdogan less educated , the former football player
this balance bozansa , less educated , recep tayyip erdogan , the former football player of the populist who led the way with the islamists believe that to some extent the broader fetullah gulen , who is a devout entrepreneur in texas from across the region to more than 1,000 schools , scores of university education institute founded the highly educated and the winning ittifakıydı hawaii .
yukarıdaki , foreign policy reported last week in the paper , a translation cümlenin .
a graduate of the university , which erdogan &apos;s less educated and former football player ; elementary school , which gulen &apos;s wide horizon is described as an entrepreneur , he produced müridlerinin gulen made clear that this and other articles in the western media are often .
after that , on the other hand , it is &quot; why in turkey , america and / or the work is the face of the west ? &quot; articles in the issue , a fact erdogan began cümlelerle ... &apos; when they are trying to explain .
in turkey , along with the west during erdogan &apos;s nevzuhur reports a situation many analysts who believe that it is possible to think that turkey may not disallowed .
in fact , according to the statistics , the erdogan era during the first ten years in turkey , where the power was drawn to the west , or an average of one period as readable .
because these ten years with the european union and the united states of america and with the synchronised way sürmekteydi good relationships .
in erdogan &apos;s one-minute with his criticism of israel to be in syria , the assad regime in the massacres , a result of the civil war broke out that the eu has revealed a clear policy and the failure of the refugee crisis in turkey in the clean up the european parliament president schulz , such as some figürlerin muhatabımız &quot; erdogan is not that the &quot; üstenci attitudes , in the uk , the opening of the contest in his own files and do so at the time , the london mayor , şimdinin foreign minister &apos;s disappointment over the alleged confessions edemeyeceğiniz iğrençlikteki run to win in turkey , the pkk , that entered the country from syria , say a live bomb katlederken provides an advanced to explain whether the pkk &apos;s syrian affiliate , the ypg in europe , both in office açtırılarak yüceltilmesi exhibitions , both of the united states , who has served in syria , ypg troops , in uniforms giymeleri armalı daeŞ with dealing with special representative brett the mcgurk &apos;s bid to join the ypg private visits to the ypg , the threat to turkey as part of the opposition groups , all the while insisting that the isolated vein and logistical support to the ypg , on the other hand , turning the daeŞ küçümsenmesi struggle with , and even in mosul as well as us support for the baghdad administration and reducing the number of our unity with the pressure and the like are included many reasons .
the hadi , a bloody coup , and as a result we are 247 insanımızı our so-called eu countries and in the united states , the failure of the coup until up to inflict no support gelmeyişini , kerry &apos;s speech in the first set to peace and stability in turkey , they expect to be constructed in the democracy and the elected government , no accent yapmayışını diyelim we forgot .
in paris , asked charlie hebdo 11 workers were killed for turkey , including many leaders from around the world participated in the protest march for democracy , but falling tanklara coup attempt 247 people were killed after a month of the past , though it is in turkey &apos;s allies in any of the western countries , how could anyone be unutulacak a speaker ?
on the issue of refugees from several times a year , a senior representative yollayanların başkanların or the lower range of what would also send representatives ?
hurriyet newspaper dressing breaking asked all the ambassadors of the eu and the united states in the past , it has to go to turkey without a visit to the grand national assembly , a solidarity visit bulunmamalarını economic growth .
when the coup in egypt during the first two weeks of the eu &apos;s high representative yollayarak sıkıştığı al sisi , the leader of the coup , and kerry &apos;s visit to democracy after a coup in recovering as saying the coup leadership yücelttiği hatırlanırsa direnişinde , support for democracy in turkey , which is not a cause of western countries with every turkish demokrasisinden kaygılandıklarını expressed sincere in turkey , contains many of the lack of abnormal does ?
hâlbuki around 95 % of people pay their respects gulen as the chief of the coup in the united states , to be allowed to leave freely , even now , to settle the turkish people outraged .
with this background i have outlined above , i think the emerging western / eklenirse america attracts only a açıklanamayacak with erdogan , the situation is clear .
moreover , he is already the united states has said that it is the effect of michael is not even ...
it means that the polls do not have never teferruat
the small , defined by their own people , &quot; he said , &quot; voting teferruattır voters do not think like him , &quot; as &quot; ignorant kaşıyan karnını aşağılayan gezi zekalılar july 15 , after a night on the question of whether the same telden çalabiliyorlar ?
the people of this state and democracy has emerged after seeing how &quot; we can answer the question &quot; where yanıldık aramışlar is there ?
but the answer to the questions that must be found so much ?
düne traitors , who served up to the levels of the state the right to use their weapons and the officers , at a time when the &quot; how &quot; hain seemed to enter the status and security of foreign istemişlerdir asylum .
how can a president amid the kind of persons and the mentally backward takıntıların sapıklık nitelenecek davranışlara how people see as directed .
when it comes to attempts to ‘ sulanmış ...
this action participants to turkey &apos;s cities of syria &apos;s cities benzetmekten whether it &apos;s come up with a further than that ?
an officer why he bombs that the parliament of his own country ?
with a wealth of bedduaları fetÖ sulanmış beyinlerden wait in line with the behaviour of the surface , such as a yanılgıya düşmemeliydik part of the world .
others are responsible for them , of course , everything is chief bilelim fetÖ is not the only .
the politics of the fight , kin and hatred as a profession , also offering staff contributions yapmışlardır necessary about the tragedies .
aydin as &quot; feel , &quot; offering , in every form of rule aymazlar unethical behaviour is natural and even terbiyesizliğin inandırmışlardır crowds .
the people of their own weapons in the hands of those who hate this to the public how verilince welcome , even at the end , we saw the fire .
we know , the way to democracy
i say something very simple : on the evening of july 15 by turkey , the soldiers inside the 64th tufeylilere fetÖ haramilere , killed 250 sergerdelere , gave a very established kurtarmaktan and democracy .
but behind the course of the 15 july of 2012 ; 2002-2012 ; and there is the aftermath , including three period .
these three : there &apos;s three prepared at the time of the economic , social , political .
the appearance of the two big social change in rural areas : drafted metropole and migration of this for a very long time to move to the centre after being kept around the cities .
on wednesday , i have made clear that through the metro to be given it .
what are the geçmeyin metro is the most important component of social change , i also added .
the second major change to the same doğrultudaki yollardır and bridges .
roads and bridges creates modernleşmeye contribute to more easily understandable .
cause income , economic and social structure .
don &apos;t have a boyfriend , so much has not changed its structure .
this historic rise to the bosphorus in istanbul i identify köprülerle taken away from me .
demirel , the bosphorus bridge .
this 1950s after villagers doruğuydu movement in the 1960s .
she is now the name of the same sort of progress on 15 july martyrs bridge as the second değiştirdiğimiz territories .
their road routes even established the relationship between the central çevre- .
then run a social change is a sign of izlendiğinin route .
demirel and Özal &apos;s large crowds walking eritmekti day .
also like them benimsetmekti ideology .
the ak party has done many years , a third bridge .
because all the pace of immigration .
the people of the satellite cities were relocated .
it has been established in areas with a bit of a closed system .
the ak party &apos;s local governments to people aş , business , social status , they also decided to vote for the ak party .
so that the atmosphere of the home , and when walking , not political bilinçlerini ownership in the centre , and after that , as they were asked to come in .
the formation of the ak party ahead of the ongoing debate over the course of the wear alakalıydı ( with ) .
this debate , the conservative accusations from people and issues mütedeyyin taşralı durmalarındaki side by side is not obliged to accept the general .
as i said after the ak party in 2002 , in a way , is the growing number of siyasallaştırdı olgunlaştırdı , added , in politics .
they then , now 3 , that on the construction of the bridge , on july 15th at the time co-author , democratic struggle .
it means that , history and sociology örtüşmüştür .
more : ekleyeyim dimension to that of the ak party , i said the move is not limited to just the istanbul köprüleriyle .
is something more interesting happening : the ak party now includes a tradition of the central cities of the environment .
this is provided through the two bridges .
a osmangazi , bridge .
two of the bridge , the dardanelles 1915 .
ways to add it .
in turkey , izmir from thrace to now look at the other end .
do you know what this young man , izmir after that , now would be the other side of the city .
of course , the ak party diyelim in izmir on the inside , where no longer take in from outside .
now , now , now , to the cities of thrace coğrafyalara if other humanities and social .

the presence of the subject to supervision of the shape of the restructuring fund
the world &apos;s biggest funds expected to be included in the presence of turkey require quietly amid the fund were issued on the law .
there is a lack of control of the fund in support of the restoration due to year-end meeting it was decided but are again without any changes being discussed .
turkey &apos;s akp brings the law offer sozcu.com.tr presence fund in evaluating the chp member of parliament and the plan and budget commissioner utku cakirozer advises , &quot; kamuya owned entities , emekçinin zorunluk pension cuts , will be collected for the unemployed , the unemployment of the fund will consist of this structure , the constitutional control mechanisms in addition to detain certainly we are against , &quot; he said .
the government &apos;s long term projects and investment funds in an attempt to report the presence of turkey &apos;s opposition , the draft law fund also requires that it should require the law were raised on tuesday .
however , the akp will offer the same today in the shape of plan and budget commission brought again .
, head of the plan and budget of the european commission , a member of the chp eskişehir member of parliament , the presence fund utku cakirozer advises on the law by offering the chp &apos;s anxiety and concern about sozcu.com.tr joined together .
cakirozer advises , &quot; it is the establishment of the fund in the budget plan and require the bill when it comes in at the head of the chp , the former minister of finance , zekeriya temizel bakanımız endişelerimizi , expressed his concern and this will also require a law and will be as detailed bid submitted for use . &quot;
in this view , acknowledging the government withdrew the bill .
the law is the same in the shape of the committee , came again yesterday .
&quot; the government should do so within a week of parliament by insisting on the release of glory , &quot; he said .
the presence of fund played a key role for the appearance of the code should be a cakirozer advises , &quot; the result of this is to have the largest endişemiz kuralsızlık teklifindeki . &quot;
&quot; public property assets , which will be the emekçinin zorunluk pension cuts for the unemployed , collected unemployment fund will consist of revenues , privatisation revenues , outside the control of the parliament and the council of state and no responsibility , which is not in a position kuralsızca being transferred to . &quot;
these kind of funds are established in russia , china , and the gulf countries for oil revenues and business excesses , and that the fund will be funded in this way , &quot; however , cakirozer advises pointing out that there is a lack of savings we have . &quot;
therefore , the fund said in a statement that is public parasından will consist of the public .
a total of 100 billion fund , unemployment , workers zorunla which means individual pension fund of 100 billion privatisation , the money is scheduled to be transferred to the 50 billion .
&quot; we want to be completely with the money will consist of this fund , will be under the supervision of the public , and this money must harcanmaması irresponsibly , &quot; he said .
when the resources of the state , the state &apos;s assets as collateral borçlanmasında a fund outside the control of parliament if cakirozer advises , stressing that it is unacceptable that the code by giving the concern about the presence of fund and the concerns we have :
the presence of such a large collection , public spending , public and business transactions on behalf of borçlanılmasına , the only independent inspection geçiştirilemez control companies .
the public is in control , and to be a transparent structure is needed .
the law offered , the presence of the fund for constitutional institutions of control and there is no provisions on transparency .
how much of a limit on funding aktarılacağı unmet .
no one in this fund on how kullanıldığıyla soramayacak account .
the aim of the fund is financing big projects as a rationale for the film .
in addition to the budget for this is where there is no need to establish a fund .
why the budget includes almıyorsunuz ?
with this in mind , naturally , and the control of parliament &quot; why sayıştaş kaçılıyor in question come from ? . &quot;
the presence of fund investments in the accumulation of money they are not opposed to that , but it was not transparent , although the mechanisms that do not are held to account , he said , noting that they are against cakirozer advises . &quot; it is whether there is a need to fund such an arguable . &quot;
but if the government played a ısrarcıysa at the time , this kind of investment funds established in other countries apply international standards in turkey , we have to make sure that &apos;s the case .
once it is in control and responsibility in a way yapılandırılmalı mechanism .
Şaibelerin on its own citizens , will not be used to account for the money that would be responsible for sonr kuruşuna way until the establishment of poverty .
the presence of a bid by the committee , which came in the form of the law fund certainly against the election , pointing out that the akp cakirozer advises , &quot; especially after the coup attempt on 15 july the parliament , we are pleased to listen to criticism . &quot;
the law also offer akp constructive eleştirilerimize listen to look forward to .
kuralsız national assets to be used as reckless those who use it , to be handed over , even though we do not control and public .
but this &quot; İstenen presence fund giderilirse can be a concern , &quot; he said .
on the proposal of the law from the opposition between the akp and played a key role for the benefit of the work was done for öğrenildi .
