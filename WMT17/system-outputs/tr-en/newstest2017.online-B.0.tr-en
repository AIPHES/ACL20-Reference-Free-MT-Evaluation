the 28-year-old cook , who recently moved to san francisco , was found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping mall this week .
but the victim &apos;s brother said he did not think he could be the one to want to hurt him , saying : &quot; in the end , things were going well for him . &quot;
the san francisco forensic medicine institute announced that the body at westfield shopping center on wednesday morning was identified as belonging to frank galicia , a 28-year-old san francisco resident .
the san francisco police department reported that the cause of death was determined to be murder , and investigations continued .
the victim &apos;s brother , louis galicia , told abc station kgo in san francisco that frank , who had previously worked as a kitchen section chief in boston , began working as a chief of the san francisco sons &amp; daughters kitchen department six months ago .
sons &amp; daughters said that this death &quot; turned them into astonishment and they were extremely sorry . &quot;
&quot; we are a small team here who works like a tight family , and he will be very much missed , &quot; the spokesman said .
in this challenging time , we would like to state that they are not alone with frank &apos;s family , and that they are with them .
louis galicia said frank initially stayed in the hostel and said , &quot; in the end , things were going well for him . &quot;
louis galicia told the kgo , &quot; he had an apartment and he was dating a girl . &quot;
louis galicia said he did not think he could be the one to want to hurt his little brother .
he was a gentle person with a huge heart .
the way of linking with the family always made us prepare a plate and make us dinner , &quot; said louis galicia .
he never liked to go into confusion .
my brother , they fit in all situations .
he spoke , &quot; when all the other things go wrong in the world , that untouched elmastic glowing every day . &quot;

assistants doctors strike : new job slowdown calls
representatives of assistant doctors asked the unions to allow work slowdown in relation to the dispute over a new contract .
the british medical association ( bma ) assistant doctors committee ( jdc ) has called the general council to support further action slowing down since the beginning of september .
jdc stated that the ministers could not resolve the contract concerns .
resident doctors and medical students rejected the contract agreement with bma .
this was rejected by 58 % of the voting members .
in an article posted on twitter thursday , jdc chief ellen mccourt said the government &quot; insistently silent &quot; about the issues that led to the rejection of the contract .
&quot; in light of this , the jdc board of directors voted to completely reject the proposed new contract and called for formal re-talks on concerns . &quot;
in response to the government &apos;s silence , the jdc management has received an official request from the bma board to allow a program to increase job slowdown from early september .
the disagreement prompted resident doctors to join six grievances this year , including the first total disruption on the nhs .
dr. johann malawana , assistant physician leader at the bma , resigned after the rejection of the terms of the contract proposed by the bma .
54,000 assistant doctors and medical students told bma members that it was a good deal to be accepted at meetings prior to voting .
after the ceremony , health minister jeremy hunt stated that the contract would be implemented as it would be for doctors in england .
russia and turkey : an &apos; alliance of incompatible &apos; ?
it was a gesture that ended the crisis .
leaders of russia and turkey met on tuesday to announcing that they had officially ended their eight-month war with shaking hands and words and economic sanctions .
but when vladimir putin greeted his turkish counterpart in the showroom of the st. petersburg palace , i got the obvious impression that ankara was the one most interested in this compromise .
hand held , yes .
however , mr. putin &apos;s smile was rather weak and could not be said to have resisted any warmth even against his own limited standards .
on the contrary , recep tayyip erdogan has repeatedly talked about &quot; good friend &quot; mr. putin , according to a report five times .
i &apos;m surprised at the number .
he also promised that relations with russia would reach far higher levels than before returning to pre-crisis levels .
the next day , a journalist there said that mr. erdogan had acted as if nothing had happened .
i think his excitement was exactly the opposite .
however , the cold impression given by mr. putin showed that the russian leader had not forgotten anything .
in fact , the first thing he mentioned in the opening statement was the cause of the crisis : turkey shot down the russian war plane on the syrian border .
then the reaction of russia was full of fury .
mr. putin made a hard start and accused ankara of stabbing moscow with his back .
the resentment was much bigger , the opposite side thought to be friendly .
rebuilding trust in the real sense will be difficult , perhaps impossible .
since november , the idea of the people of russia has changed .
the state-controlled media has been targeting ankara for months in a staggering and aggressive manner .
suddenly , it was the turks who were all criminals .
the most serious of these were accusations that senior officials were making profits from the illegal oil trade in the areas under the control of the so-called islamic state of syria &apos;s family of mrs erdogan .
he himself refused to do so .
but the official message from st. petersburg was that it was time to go .
ultimately , the reason for this meeting was that mr putin had received his apology from president erdogan .
russia can see it as a kind of victory .
the benefits of the ceasefire call for ankara are very clear .
first of all , erdogan needs friends after the unsuccessful blow that will happen the month we passed and almost cause him to topple .
repeated terrorist attacks in turkey were also very influential .
economic reasons are also active .
the sanctions imposed by russia were tight , especially the prohibition of private flights carrying several million russian tourists to the coastal areas of turkey each year .
this number has dropped by almost 90 % .
tour operators and rental companies in russia were also relieved that the flights would continue .
they have relied on the end-season intensity of the mediterranean season .
and this week , state television predicted a reduction in fruit and vegetable prices as turkish agricultural products imports were allowed again .
if he were going to quote from the news in the vedemosti newspaper , &quot; tourists are there , tomatoes are here &quot; .
however , there was a separate political value for moscow .
ankara is angry with the west for not finding enough reaction to the coup attempt .
sayin putin , who wants to take advantage of the coldness of turkey &apos;s ties with the west and the intervening , enters a new era when the long-awaited annoyance is added to the negotiations on joining the us .
it seems that it has certainly gathered sympathy from ankara because of the call for the support of elected officials after the russian coup attempt .
it should not be forgotten that this inevitable attitude for moscow , which had a fundamental fear of regime change .
this summit , held in this spectacular palace on the seaside , represents an &quot; alliance of disagreements &quot; as russia and turkey explain to me an analyst : the two countries that the west rejects and behaves badly are joining forces .
nevertheless , despite the appearance of this compromise , they are quite different from each other .
one of the most important of these is about syria : moscow shows itself as a mediator , but russia and turkey support different sides .
this is supported by the fact that after the first interviews , which lasted for almost three hours , the two presidents did not mention this issue at the press conference .
while the president of turkey clearly avoided answering the question about these differences , mr. putin chose to undermine them .
there is no clear consensus on how to determine the common ground in syria .
but it is certainly a good development for the two leaders to begin talking at the very least - after months of open hostility - and when the nato member takes into account the potential for catastrophic disaster as a result of turkey knocking down a russian war plane .
the royal bank of scotland is disappearing for customers outside of scotland
according to the statement of the chief executive officer of the bank , the rbs brand will go to the position of a back office .
the royal bank of scotland will disappear for customers outside of scotland .
ross mcewan , the bbc , told scotland that the rbs brand is associated with the bank &apos;s global goals .
eight years ago , as it was almost sinking , he had to retreat and give up .
in the meantime , brand strategy experts used &apos; rbs &apos; to protect other consumer finance brands .
it was backed by millions of pounds for many sponsorships , from the six-nation rugby championship to the wimbledon andy murray champion .
now , however , it has been decided that it will be more appropriate for national brands to stand out .
the royal bank of scotland will be used by scottish customers , but new beginnings will not be made .
all references to rbs will be changed to natwest , except in the case of uk and wales quoted at the headquarters and stock exchange .
the ulster bank brand is already being used for customers in the republic of ireland and northern ireland .
there are also smaller brands that will take on a much more dominant role in retail banking : coutts , adam &amp; co , drummond and holt &apos;s military bank .
mr. mcewan gave an interview on inverness-shire for clients and staff .
the bbc said to scotland : &quot; from now on we will become a brand with more brands and we will no longer be rbs brand investor brands and our employees will be employed . &quot;
as the bank itself became a global brand , rbs became a global brand .
i say it is not global , we have local goals .
each of these brands will stand out in a slightly different way in the community they are in and our staff will work with customers under the names of these brands .
rbs announced that it will not continue its sponsorship of the six nations championships and is raising the profile of different brands on sports sponsorship .
&quot; we now have the time to move on to the brand banking approach because we are asking ourselves , how can we make it a better bank for our customers , &quot; said the chief executive officer .
three years ago , we would be a great bank for our customers , and if we had mentioned that we would present these brands , i would have been sarcastic .
but i think that you will see a lot of change with our work and our focus on the needs of our customers , not ourselves .
we can re-engage these brands , so i think it &apos;s the right time .
frankie dettori earns 3000th victory with predilection in newmarket
dettori launches champagne after reaching 3000th victory with double success in newmarket
jokey frankie dettori won the 3000th victory in newmarket in england on friday .
on his local track , he reached this milestone by winning his second victory of the night with john gosden &apos;s predilection .
the 45-year-old italian is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in an obstacle-free run .
he follows the traces of sir gordon richards , doug smith , lester piggott , pat eddery and willie carson .
jockey , who had three championships in ghayyar before , said : &quot; this is a special occasion . &quot;
i &apos;m very touched that my parents are here too
it makes me really happy that this is newmarket , where i started this business 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not an important meeting , it &apos;s not a royal ascot - it &apos;s just an ordinary friday night with 20,000 people .
i feel relieved and relaxed .
dettori accepted the cheers by bringing predilection after victory
there were two jockeys that reached this milestone : champion jockey richard johnson and retired jockey sir anthony mccoy , championing 20 times and winning over 4300 victories in his career .
lester piggott , who won the derby race nine times , has 4493 victories in his career
it is not surprising that frankie is one of the best jockeys of our age and reaches a milestone reached by only a few people before him .
a tactical mentality that has a strong personality , but possesses the element that makes the balance weigh heavier than others .
he represents the horse race in an extraordinary way , with the excitement and charisma of this subject and the people who have been shooting it for years .
a few weeks ago , i told frankie in epsom that he might have just reached the 6000th victory if it was not a jockey competing on weekends and big races .
to be honest , frankie has been victorious in most of the 30 years he has been racing in the uk , which is great to see .
he has a very exciting character and is a very good feature for those british races , but beyond that is an extraordinary jockey .
frankie dettori celebrated this milestone with the iconic bouncing motion of stroke
frankie dettori has become a symbol of british obstacle-free running for twenty years with many moves from the races he has jumped up to his descent .
this is a full , rolling road .
in 1996 , he survived a plane crash , winning several major races , including the famous &apos; big seven &apos; victory in ascot , and was banned for not complying with the drug ban .
three years ago he showed difficulty during the return from this six-month suspension process , but showed that he had a strong character , which is necessary to make his suspects unfair and return to their best .
and he could go on for a while , dettori said he wanted to continue racing until at least 50 years old .
russian president putin gets special pen , sergei ivanov , from office
president of russia vladimir putin unexpectedly took the special pen , sergei ivanov .
mr. ivanov was part of the immediate vicinity to which mr. putin was assured for many years .
at the age of 63 , he was now assigned as a special representative for environmental and transport issues .
in a statement made by the kremlin , mr putin said , &quot; ivanov &apos;s decision of the russian administration &apos;s chief has decided to terminate his mission , &quot; but no reason was given .
for this position , mr. ivanov was assigned to anton vaino , who has been acting as deputy since 2012 .
vaino , 44 , is a former diplomat .
born in 1972 in tallinn , capital of estonia , graduated from the department of international relations ( mgimo ) of the well-known moscow state institute and served in the tokyo embassy .
he was then interested in the presidency protocol and the administration of government personnel , as is the expression on the kremlin website ( in russian ) .
after his assignment , he told mr. putin : &quot; thank you for your trust in me . &quot;
i think that the most important task of the government is to support your activities as head of state in supervising the enforcement of laws and regulations .
mr. putin announced on friday that he would like to withdraw his job from the ivanov office on the russian television channel and propose mr. vaino to replace him .
is my smile persuasive ?
this is a move that astonishes moscow .
sergei ivanov was working as one of the closest allies of the long-running vladimir putin , and like himself , the soviet security forces served the kgb .
he was one of the strongest people in the country as a special pen .
at a meeting with president putin and published on the state television , both of them stated that the private stay had been withdrawn from the office voluntarily .
despite the smiling poses given to the camera , however , very few people are convinced , especially in this period of parliamentary elections .
is this a disagreement on the basis of some kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows that yet .
however , the official statement that a person who could be president could suddenly want to direct russia &apos;s environmental policy was met with great suspicion .
according to an excerpt from the kremlin website , mr. ivanov has spoken to mr. putin : &quot; in the beginning of 2012 , it is true that we want you to trust me for four years for this task - which you can say is challenging - even problematic .
well , apparently , i served as presidential private pen for four years , eight months .
mr. ivanov undertook this task in december 2011 .
he had previously served as deputy prime minister and minister of defense .
he is a former member of the kgb state security forces , such as the russian security council member and mr putin .
at the end of the 1990s , mr. putin was acting as the president of the federal security forces ( fsb ) , which replaced the kgb , and mr. ivanov acted as his proxy .
when mr putin was in power , ivanov was shown as one of the five most trusted people .
mr. putin &apos;s presidency in the third period was contrary to the constitution , and mr. ivanov was thought to be the president after mr. putin &apos;s second term .
this task , however , was handed over to another close ally of putin , dmitry medvedev .
mr putin was the prime minister before returning to the presidency after three and a half years .
criminal minds star thomas gibson was fired after shooting into the producer
gibson has been involved in a physical battle in his late-night moon set in los angeles .
producing the series , abc studios and cbs television studios announced that they were out of the business in a joint statement .
gibson , who portrayed special agent aaron hotchner , issued an apology on tuesday before the notice of termination was made .
there were differences and disagreements about sette creative issues .
&quot; i am saddened by the fact that such an event has occurred , &quot; he said .
a statement from abc studios and cbs television studios states that detailed information on how to remove gibson &apos;s character from the program following a group of fbi agents will be given in the future .
the 54-year-old actress , formerly in dharma &amp; greg &apos;s status comedy , has been on the program since the first seizure in 2005 .
&quot; i love criminal minds and i &apos;ve been working on it for twelve years , giving it my heart and soul , &quot; gibson said on a friday broadcast .
i would have wanted to stay until the end but this is no longer possible .
i just want to thank the writers , the producers , the actors , the wonderful team , and most importantly the best supporters that a program can have .
the program is expected to return to the screens on september 28 for the twelfth season .
the mystery of fish in banff &apos;s garden
a person living in a banff area has been helped to identify the fish that emerged in banff &apos;s garden .
kevin bain thinks that these 75 fish may be sandfish transported by sea hose .
bain , who lived 500 meters from the sea , published images in periscope in hopes that some of them would shed light on the appearance of fish two inches in length .
queensferry passage : the bridge is now bound to fife
£ 1.35 billion worth of project to be completed by may 2017
the engineers united the northern part of the queensferry pass and the viaduct , which means that the bridge now belongs to fife .
this is the first of the four closures between the &quot; cupboard fans &quot; , which are about to be completed around each of the three towers of the bridge .
the section from köprünün fife is 600 meters long and weighs 30.000 tons .
10.000 tons of steel and 20.000 tons of concrete and 46 support cables .
the project worth £ 1.35 billion must be completed by may 2017 .
economy minister keith brown was one of the first people to visit the facilities today and walk across the land bridge .
he said : &quot; this is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the queensferry pass .
we all use 30,000 tons of concrete for the construction of this part of the bridge , and we are witnessing the engineering in a truly epic scale with this project .
despite the extraordinary size and weight of the bridge that closes the gap between the viaduct and the bridge deck , it is a sensitive operation that requires extremely precise tolerances for this alignment .
in general , almost 79 % of the total bridge floor is settled , concrete casting of the first section of the table will be carried out in rosyth today , which means that the entire table will be ready to be taken over the bridge .
michael martin , director of project for forth and bridge contractors , said : &quot; in all bridge projects , the first closure is always an important milestone .
in this extraordinary project , this closing represents the pioneer in civil engineering .
we had to close the gap on the north-or-west side after the last road platform was installed and connected to the expanding north tower level .
this was done by pulling the viaduct in the north to about 700 millimeters south .
this was huge but at the same time very sensitive .
the reason for its large size was that the viaduct was 222 meters long , weighs almost 6000 tons , and had to be pulled at about 3 % slope .
the reason for being sensitive was that the tolerance values the team had to follow were very low , only a few millimeters on either side .
fortunately everything went well .
moelfre bay rescue team : three men &apos; lucky for being alive&apos;
the three men were &quot; lucky to have survived &quot; after their fall from the fishing boat in anglesey .
the moelfre rnli lifeguard station gave an alert on friday , 13 : 20 am with the english summer time , after the facility saw the incident in the bay of moelfre .
the three men were struggling to swim to a safe area as the boats continued on their way .
&quot; we saw that teknen was drawing circles towards them and we were worried , &quot; said moelfre &apos;s lifeguard chief control officer .
&quot; fortunately , we were far away with strong winds until we came to them on the right path , &quot; he added .
two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat , while the third man , aged 60 , found himself tired , holding a buoy without a lifejacket .
all of them were taken to the lifeguard &apos;s way to the shore and brought to the lifeguard station
mr. jones said : &quot; the three men who fall into the water are lucky to be alive and unharmed .
there was an emergency stop cable in the boat engine , but it must have been disconnected from the person who used the boat when the boat was in the alabora .
someone was watching these three men today .
a valuable type of hunting for health and happiness , pokémon go
it &apos;s really amazing to see how the world has changed .
the fact that young people and children no longer go out to play games and prefer to spend their spare time looking at the screens is a condition most people have been upset over the past decade .
pokemon go is encouraging people to move up from the couch .
the time spent looking at the screens spread over time to video games , and finally to smartphones , primarily limited to television .
for this reason , it is really great to see that technology and outdoor movement are not mutually exclusive .
of course , i &apos;m talking about pokémon go , an application based on characters that were first created for video games in the 90 &apos;s ( later converted to line cards , game cards and other by-products ) .
like many of the popular cultures , this new game was also mixed in the early july when it was offered in the us , australia and new zealand .
subsequently , the presentation was delayed in other countries due to the intense interest in overloading the servers .
over the course of days , pokémon went more and more to the same number of users than go tinder .
how does it work ?
in a nutshell , players take their smartphones , go for pokémon in the way they are tracked by gps , and &apos; snap &apos; pictures ( take a screenshot on the phone ) or &apos; capture &apos; them .
the game has joined this craze in a couch for a generation seeking younger ages .
in the us , the game provided a significant increase in the number of steps an &quot; average &quot; person threw each day .
cardiogram , an application developed for apple watch and followed by 35,000 users , has recently risen from 45 percent to 53 percent of those exercising 30 days each day within the two days following the delivery of the game to washington post .
the company does not know who plays pokémon go , only raw data at the level of exercise can be seen .
most public health campaigns encouraging people to &quot; spend 30 minutes &quot; , &quot; stay in the couch &quot; and &quot; active every day &quot; were ignored because most public health messages were boring and communicated by seemingly miserable people .
but still , the emphasis on exercise is minimal .
people who exercise regularly are less likely to have cancer or depression .
it provides help in matters such as exercise , weight control , high blood pressure and diabetes , and has a list of benefits that are too long to be listed here .
however , the beauty of pokémon go is to make people go out to do something they enjoy .
in this way , three basic elements of health are covered : fun , fresh air and sunshine .
some people even get new friends during hunting .
as always , there are also sullen jugglers looking for something to complain about .
and of course someone can hit the door while walking .
what difference does it make ?
a great innovation was offered .
smartphone applications such as fitbit followed our movement but it did not give us a reason to exercise like this game .
the effect of innovation will pass and usage will decrease with time .
however , due to pokémon &apos;s success , many games will help to make people who are hunting through activities and virtual reality real-world activities more active , fit and healthy .

simone biles closes gold medal in overall evaluation of women &apos;s gymnastics
forget the print .
forget the excitement .
simone biles has immunity to all this .
dynamic about jumping .
relaxed on balance .
amazing place with it .
down to perfection at first .
and he &apos;s an olympic champion now .
the 19-year-old american gymnast was also the first to complete the overall assessment on thursday , clearly showing the difference between himself and the rest of the world in the olympics .
in total , 62,198 points were above the silver medalist aly raisman , a friend of the &quot; last five &quot; , and aliya mustafina , the russian bronze medalist .
in the united states , simone biles performed in the equilibrium instrument on thursday at the rio de janeiro summer olympics in rio de janeiro , brazil , during the overall evaluation of women &apos;s artistic gymnastics .
biles became the fourth and generally fifth american woman to receive a consecutive overall evaluation award and announced her name as her generation and perhaps the best of all time .
when the final total was released , he drowned in tears and the long journey to reach this destination came to an end .
this success was at the same level as athletes like michael phelps , who can be seen once in every generation that delivers the sport to new levels :
biles has been one of the most successful of this sport with its stunning mix of ambition and tenderness that allowed him to call himself the 15th world championship medal of the last three years and the 1984 olympic champion mary lou retton as &quot; the best gymnast i have ever seen &quot; .
a final test in brazil was waiting for him , not just between biles and the other people in the field , but between the burden he and his big anticipates had created .
texas would be seen as a disappointment to return to the family house in spring with less than a handful of gold medals .
simone biles , left , and aly raisman from the united states , after having received gold and silver medals respectively in the overall evaluation of women &apos;s artistic gymnastics at the 2016 rio de janeiro summer olympics in brazil , thursday , august .
biles won on tuesday when he was serving as an exclamation mark in the farewell party of the former retired national team co-ordinator martha karolyi .
biles insists that he does not look forward to the summit this long , but that is not exactly true .
the part of the floor exercise routine , which has become an icon , is also prepared with latin music that will perfectly fit the street just outside the rio olympic arena .
this is not a coincidence .
the girl , discovered by boorman &apos;s mother , became a force when she was adopted by her grandmother and grandfather as a younger child and was taken to a gymnasium coached by aimee boorman .
i have not lost any of the overall ratings since the summer of 2013 , and this biles is a series of wins to continue as long as they want .
although mustafina assumed leadership in two rotations , it was temporary .
the equilibrium tool and ground exercises that biles has won the world championship have not been done yet .
the balance went ahead with 15,433 points in the tool and it crowned 15,933 points in the ground exercise .
raisman graciously grabbed him when he waited for his final score , and tears appeared around the glowing red , white , and blue eye makeup , while his vision that biles once wrote into a scrapbook was real .
raisman &apos;s performance seemed like a rematch of his performance four years ago when he shared the fourth but then lost the bronze medal to mustafina .
this time , the 22-year-old captain of the americans was named &quot; nine &quot; .
from time to time , with a seemingly suspicious return , he sent a kiss to the crowd after ground exercise , which he received from his superiors .
for the 19-year-old biles , the twisted tweet that he threw earlier this week is now completely new :
police : 3 victims in the serial killer case were shot while listening to music on the car
phoenix &apos;s first serial killer case for the past ten years , two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot while listening to music and talking on the car , according to police reports posted on thursday .
officials said angela rochelle liner , stefanie r. ellis and ellis &apos; daughter maleah were shot in the car parked on a garage road on june 12th .
the raporda armed person is standing on the passenger side of the car and is fired eight times with a pistol and is being driven away by another vehicle .
police say these three murders do not appear to be robberies because the attacker has not received adult handbags or $ 2,900 in victim &apos;s money .
phoenix police spokesman , assistant commissioner jonathan howard , said the investigators of the armed assault led him to investigate whether it was linked to the previous four assaults .
in a four-month period , seven people were killed and two injured in a total of nine assaults in predominantly spanish neighborhoods .
at the beginning of this month , howard told howard gis affiliate kpho , &quot; this is in a residential area in front of a house . &quot;
suspects are believed to have used a number of vehicles including a black nissan in the late 1990s , a black bmw in the late 1990s , and a white cadillac or lincoln .
the researchers refused to disclose the evidence that the attacks were related to the same killer and that they were the result of the same killer .
ellis ( 33 ) was hospitalized for injuries and then lost his life .
liner ( 31 ) and ellis &apos;s daughter , maleah , lost their lives at the scene .
a person who witnessed this , the police said that listening to music by sitting on the parked cars was not unusual .
authorities also issued a police report on the shooting at an empty truck half an hour before the three murders .
the researchers found bullet hives , a bullet from one arm and bullet particles in the engine compartment .
mother of 6-year-old microcephaly patient : &quot; it &apos;s getting better &quot;
like most six-year-olds , edmund picciuto loves singing , toys and , of course , his mother .
but contrary to his peers , edmund has a microcephaly disorder , a genetic disorder in which his mother , elizabeth picciuto , is not aware of her presence during her pregnancy .
when i first came home , my first thought was that i could not do it .
i can not do that .
i did not want that .
of course , these are not true , of course you want it , &quot; he said .
he and his wife vincent were told that edmund could never recognize them and could not even survive .
some doctors went so far as to suggest that they should be admitted to the nursing home .
&quot; the first reaction was to say that i do not think people are doing it anymore , &quot; picciuto said .
edmund can walk with the help of a walker .
edmund could not sit up to the age of three or could not retire and still can not speak .
however , he is slowly reaching some turning points .
he can walk with help and he can bike .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
elizabeth shows the sign language that edmund made up to say &quot; please sing to me . &quot;
picciuto told cbs news , &quot; we teach him sign language . &quot;
but this is not a sign , as we know it , he says edmund fits his own markings .
microcephaly may arise from a number of different conditions , such as edmund , which may be due to infections caused by viruses such as measles and zika during pregnancy .
the symptoms and the course of the disease may vary greatly .
it &apos;s too early to tell how the lives of people with zika infections will be affected .
picciuto remembers the emotional burden of the ambiguity of the future .
i was constantly asking what would happen .
what will it be ?
and he still does not know that .
actually , i did not ask anyone to tell me really , so i did not ask a question about the long-running disease .
however , picciuto is able to offer hopeful advice for mothers of babies who are born because of zika .
it &apos;s getting better .
you know it will be better for you .
you will love your child , your child will love you too .
in louisiana , mississippi , heavy rains and flood rescue teams mobilized

why we need simone , gabby and laurie
i put this name on this year &apos;s women &apos;s olympic gymnastics team and it has more than one reason .
first of all , i joined all summer olympics since 1984 , and the us has never been so dominant .
the second : this team has three gymnasts who inspire children with different ethnic backgrounds : simone biles , gabby douglas and lauren &quot; laurie &quot; hernandez .
the structure of this team , brought together by jewish aly raisman and catholic madison kocian , makes everybody proud .
the team eventually looks similar to america .
it also strengthens the presence of black and latino women in the upper levels of this sport .
over the past four years , the first female gymnast has always been an african-american .
in the past year , simone and gabby were in first and second place .
it &apos;s a powerful thing .
in the last olympics , gabby douglas was a surprise olympic champion and america supported him .
now the whole world can witness the extraordinary performances of gymnastics routines unexpectedly mastered by simone biles , douglas and laurie hernandez with three world championships .
on thursday , simone became the fourth consecutive american to win a gold medal in women &apos;s overall evaluation .
and his teammate aly raisman won a silver medal .
we are renowned for the best times of this sport , but this does not seem to be the case for gymnastics courses throughout the country .
simone , gabby and laurie followed the same path as aly and madison to take part in the olympic team .
the reason for being &quot; the last five &quot; is that there will be only four gymnasts in the next olympic gymnastics team , which is the last year marta karolyi will coach .
but in reality gymnastics is a very costly sport and gymnasts are working primarily in private gymnastic clubs supported by parents &apos; education , travel , form , competition , hotel fees ( for coaches , gymnasts and families )
most of these gymnastics clubs are located in wealthy suburban neighborhoods where they can support these businesses .
these clubs are the only place where gymnasts can receive training and require costly and long-term commitment to the families of gymnasts .
simone biles &apos;s coach aimee boorman and laurie hernandez &apos;s coach maggie haney have been training these athletes since the day they started gymnastics .
for countless young girls affected by simone , gabby and laurie , we do not offer more affordable and accessible gym training to communities .
i founded my own gymnastics foundation 20 years ago .
in my organizations , we have offered free and low cost gymnastics training for over 15,000 gyms ( primarily black and hispanic ) in the city centered on harlem and coached both national and international champions .
in september , we will expand to detroit ( where i grew up ) to offer quality gym training to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this wonderful olympic sport .
gymnastics improves the strength , flexibility and coordination of the body and provides mental rigor , discipline and stability .
this combination offers long-term benefits for health , school and job success .
it will be an inspiration for this team that will direct thousands of young girls to gymnastics and that &apos;s great .
participation in sports activities is especially important for girls .
we pass through really exciting times .
simone , aly , laurie , gabby and madison for bringing the gold medal as an olympic team and expressing the &quot; girl &apos;s power &quot; clearly and motivating many young girls with different backgrounds to be healthy , strong and successful young women .
after jeremy hunt &apos;s offer was rejected , resident doctors decided to resume strikes
the ministers hoped that the dispute would come to an end after a consensus on the contract was signed with the british national legislative officers , but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who participated in the vote gave a rejection .
in july , mr. hunt announced plans to implement sanctions on the contract , stating that the nhs was &quot; no one &apos;s property &quot; and that further delays would harm personnel and illness .
the first assistant physician group was transferred to a new contract that includes changes to work practices at night and on weekends to improve care outside normal hours .
&quot; the assistant doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract , especially considering that it will trigger the current workforce crisis and that an equal attitude is not being adopted by all doctors , &quot; said dr. ellen mccourt , head of the bma &apos;s assistant doctors committee .
only eight weeks before the first doctor group gets transferred to the new contract , progress needs to be made and the time is running out .
the bma &apos;s efforts to resolve the dispute have been met with the government &apos;s reluctance to interact and in some cases with deafening silence .
this is an improvement despite jeremy hunt &apos;s promise that last month &apos;s door will always be open .
&quot; jeremy hunt needs to act immediately , lift sanctions , and listen to the concerns of assistant doctors . &quot;
the assistant doctors clearly state that they are prepared to increase work slowdown activities if they do not do so .
at the end of april , the last strike , nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments were postponed , nurses and consultants had to look after the doctors on strike .
the ministers hoped that the dispute would come to an end after a mutual agreement was reached on the improved contract with the british legislative officers .
the bma is asking for 54,000 resident doctors to improve their weekend rates .
nhs employers executive board manager daniel mortimer called on assistant doctors to apply any strike .
mr mortimer said : &quot; the strike does not solve anything , but it creates pressure on already intense teams and services , causing concern , discomfort and distress for patients , caregivers and their families . &quot;
for the past two months we have been in talks with the assistant doctors committee and have positively approached our concerns with the ministry of health and other authorities regarding the observation task and prospecting .
employers were hopeful that it was a sign that employers were being taken seriously by the uk &apos;s ministry of medical education and health to ensure that positive communication with the bma in the months to november , february and may is maintained , including important issues - distribution , training flexibility , additional training for career breaks , training costs , curriculum mutual recognition , training inducement and enviable salary difference between sexes .
medication that can lift the risk of a heart attack at a cost of £ 2 per day
thousands of heart attack patients will be able to benefit from a drug costing £ 2 a day , after the authorities have suggested that they be given more personalities for longer periods .
ticagrelor , which prevents clotting , reduces the risk of recurring crises for people with heart problems .
the medication was administered during the 12 months following the heart attack and was reducing the risk of stroke or another crisis .
the nhs observer , nice , suggested that it be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
but now the nhs observer , nice proposed that it be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
every year about 140,000 people in the uk are experiencing a heart attack , and one in four is experiencing another crisis or stroke .
the cause of heart attacks and strokes is the accumulation of fat deposits and plaque on arterial walls .
if the plaque breaks down , it can cause blood clots , block heart disease , and cause a heart attack .
and if the clot gets out of place , it will paralyze if it blocks the flow of blood to the brain by going through the bloodstream .
those who have had a crisis before are at a higher risk of having another crisis .
created by the uk firm astrazeneca under the trade name brilique , ticagrelor reduces this risk by reducing clot probability .
the nice guidelines draft today recommends that people give 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg twice a day for three years with aspirin .
professor carole longson , director of the nice health technology assessment center , said : &quot; despite the availability of effective secondary prevention therapies , a quarter of those who have had a heart attack are experiencing another heart attack or stroke and are often destructive . &quot;
fear of recurrence can have a very negative impact on a person &apos;s quality of life .
the evidence suggests that co-administration of ticagrelor with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of recurrent heart attacks and stroke in people who have had a heart attack earlier .
we are pleased that ticagrelor has been offered on a temporary basis and has increased the treatment options offered to thousands of people waiting to benefit from it .
since more than three years of information on the effectiveness and safety of ticagrelor is limited - mainly at risk of bleeding , the guidelines draft does not propose treatment after this period .
pc culture has increased vote corruption in muslim areas
former tower hamlets mayor lutfur rahman dismissed for corruption after last year &apos;s government report
as the devastating government report presented today shows , the culture of political correctness has led to the oversight of broad-based corruption in muslim communities .
former cabinet minister sir eric pickles scolded the policemen , election observers and the municipal court because evidence of abuse of election was ignored because of &quot; extreme sensitivity to ethnic origin and religion &quot; .
the former community secretary and today &apos;s anti-corruption victim , the voters &apos; reliance on religious grounds , must be allowed to strip the voting cabin out of the voting cabinets in order to protect the frightened voters from such a bad level .
he suggested voters to keep their identities in order to prove their identity at the time they voted .
in the present case , it is enough to say the name and address of the voter .
the report even suggests permanent inking on the finger during voting to prevent people from voting twice .
sir eric said that those who were present should be better protected .
he called for better access to the board &apos;s decisions and decisions on informal committees or working groups .
&quot; this not only protects against fraud in the elections , it also aims to protect the local government from the corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it , &quot; he said .
the report was prepared at the direction of downing street after tower hamlets &apos; vote scandal in east london .
in the past year , a special election court has decided to take over the mayor , lutfur rahman , after repeated corruption and illegal practices .
the court found that rahman &quot; abused unfairly &quot; the religious feelings of the muslim community and silenced him with racism and islamophobia accusations .
rahman &apos;s &quot; campaign is based on the belief that muslims vote for him is a religious duty . &quot;
up to 300 games were suspicious or the use of false identity , the result of voting as someone else .
sir eric stated that there was evidence of fraud in the country .
he warned about corruption , especially in postal polling - where the elderly people of the muslim community were allegedly oppressing the vote of their chosen people .
sir eric has made some suggestions for organizing a system of voting , including the identification of people to prove who they are
the report contained the following statements : &quot; there was evidence that some ethnic minority communities , particularly women and young people , especially the pakistani and bangladeshi communities , were pressured to vote for the will of the elderly .
&quot; concerns existed that state institutions ignored such behavior because of &quot; political correctness &quot; based on extreme sensitivity to ethnicity and religion .
sir eric had 50 proposals for organizing the system , including preventing mail and voting documents from being processed by political activists for the purpose of &quot; collecting votes &quot; .
the report , investigated by theresa may , also calls for tightening of enrollment checks to prevent the electoral roll from being used for immigration and social aid corruption purposes .
considering the option of voters voting before voting .
permanent ink applied to someone &apos;s fingers after voting to prevent someone from voting twice .
systematic controls on the nationality of the person to determine the suitability of voting .
three-year limitation on requests for automatic mail voting .
prohibition of political campaigners and activists to process the envelopes of the completed post and the mailed post votes .
police , the authority to withdraw lanes around the voting cabinets .
amendment of the law to facilitate the accusation of scandal within the scope of the people &apos;s representative act of 1983 .
making photographs illegal in voting booths .
only english speaking ( except for wales ) in the voting booths .
strengthening the training of the staff on enforcing the rule for voters to enter the cabinet alone .
sir eric criticized the police service ruthlessly , saying that it was &quot; interesting &quot; that no charges were made in tower hamlets .
&quot; the election court ruled that lutfur rahman and his representative had no place to blame for repeated corruption and illegal activities , &quot; he said .
he was guilty of a number of reasons beyond reasonable suspicion - according to the nature of the eschatological evidence .
he also criticized the municipal court &apos;s ineffective &quot; tick marking controls &quot; in the electoral registers .
sir eric said : &quot; tower hamlets &apos; court decision last year was a warning alert .
although our nation has the pride of creating the mother of parliament , the spread of these worrisome and secret electoral corruption and its rejection by some institutions may cause this good reputation to be damaged .
being crazy for kate &apos;s other similar celebrities like the cyclist-like and rio olympic players
this week , the rio 2016 olympics fascinated french cyclist pauline ferrand-prevot , whose passion proved impressive to the duchess of cambridge .
however , the 24-year-old olympic athlete is not the only athlete who draws attention to the celebrities when they fight for the gold medal this summer , at least that &apos;s what social media thinks .
for this reason , in honor of all the famous celebrities we have seen in rio games and on our screens , femail has prepared a list of olympic athletes who look more like hollywood celebrities than they look .
hunter and wolf : us men &apos;s archery team member brady ellison ( left ) , compared with leonardo dicaprio since childhood
in addition to kate &apos;s similar to the bicycle track , many in the online environment showed that an archer might look like a twin to leonardo dicaprio .
brady ellison , a member of the us men &apos;s archery team , shook twitter after photographs showing the similarity of the monster hunter to the star of filmin .
and the archer realized this madness in social media and confessed to him that he was like leo since childhood .
brady said to the huffington post : &apos; i do not think there is a great similarity except for hair and beard . &apos; 
&apos;he &apos;s a handsome guy , so i guess that &apos;s a compliment . &apos; 
one of london 2012 &apos;s most popular comparisons , no doubt , will draw even more attention this year : the incredible resemblance to british long-jump athlete greg rutherford &apos;s popular actor neil patrick harris .
russian gymnast aliya mustafina , with his big , meaningful eyes and the cuban-born american artist gloria estefan , is said to be the one .
and in the pool , south african swimmer cameron van der burgh has been likened to glee &apos;s star matthew morrison for years .
amendment : this user is an &apos; athletic version &apos; of nathan &apos;s starring star
tennis star rafael nadal and actor josh hartnett are long compared to each other because of their lush eyebrows and the similarity of their lips .
the russian team &apos;s silver medal swimmer has the same bronze skin and blond hair as the actress annalynne mccord , while fans of the us team say nathan adrian resembles the athletic version of joseph gorgon levitt .
tough women : soccer star hope solo ( on the left ) and dexter &apos;s star jennifer carpenter ( on the right ) have a similar face shape and eyes
not alone : he was a twitter user , and he was very happy that no other person noticed this similarity
an airborne theory : this user feels that there may be a reason behind the fact that this couple looks like
a twitter user carried the happiness he heard about &quot; the rest of the internet thinking that hope solo and jennifer carpenter are like twins . &quot;
actually , the us football star and the actress who plays in dexter have similar face shapes and eyes .
other popular comparisons include the almost identical smile of kerri walsh-jennings and actress laura linney with another golden-eyed gymnast gabby douglas and the big smiles of gabrielle union , the youthful fire filminin star gabrielle union .
cbc olympic spokesperson apologizes for commenting on the chinese swimmer &apos; s death as a pig
byron macdonald &apos;s analysis of ai yanhan &apos;s 4th place in the 4x200m free race at the age of 14 led the cbc to be very angry with the audience on wednesday &apos;s live olympic broadcast
the canadian publishing company cbc was forced to apologize for commenting on one of her commentators that the 14-year-old female chinese swimmer had &quot; wiped off like a bad smell &quot; and that she was &quot; killed like a pig &quot; on the race .
interviewer byron macdonald thought the microphone was off when women began to explain their ideas in the 4x200 m free relay race final .
it was heard that macdonald , who was included to add &apos; color &apos; to the cbc &apos;s announcer team , said : &apos; the little chinese at the age of 14 had a big bang , my baby . &apos; 
he was too excited , wiped out like a bad smell and killed like a pig .
thank you for that .
chinese swimmer ai yanhan ( 14 ) finished second in the flag race for 1 : 57.79 , allowing him to stay behind the canadian taylor rack 1,61 seconds , closing the gap between canadians and china .
canadian viewers moved quickly after being surprised by the tone and language used
emmett macfarlane &quot; the cbc spiker just tweeted that his 14-year-old was &quot; like a pig &quot; .
he &apos;s retarded , he did not realize he was still on the air . &apos;
chinese ai yanhan is described in the 4 x 200m freestyle relay as follows : &apos; the little chinese at the age of 14 had a heavy blow , my baby . &apos; 
criticisms about byron macdonald were published on twitter quite harshly and quickly , and many of them were self-reported
twitter users could not help themselves when they heard how insensitive byron macdonald was
another twitter user , sarah paradis , wrote : &apos; wow # byronmacdonald .
you represent cbc and canada , and you make us all look racist .
soon after , scott russel , who continued the publication of the cbc , apologized for macdonald &apos;s comment : &apos; we apologize for the comment posted on the swimming race . &apos; 
these were really unfortunate words , and we are sorry that such an event happened . &apos;
cbc had to apologize at least 90 times for those who tweeted in reaction to the comment
another spokesman , scott russel , was forced to apologize for macdonald &apos;s
cbc then copied and pasted this apology to more than 90 twitter users who submitted complaints about macdonald &apos;s comments
the network quickly apologized and issued a statement .
these expressions have been made and we would like to express our sincere regret over the fact that they have been broadcast .
we sincerely apologized to our followers last night , on the air , from our followers on social media .
we want to explain that byron &apos;s comments were not about the personality of his swimming , but about his performance .
however , these were words that were quite inappropriate and unfortunate , and byron was extremely upset about what he said .
on thursday , after lunch , macdonald also apologized and said he did not want to make a personal attack and attempted to defend these words .
he said in the cbc &apos;s olympic publication , &quot; i want to apologize for the comments i made after the women &apos;s relay race last night . &quot;
&quot; i was at the point of performance , not the personality of my cheek . &quot;
&quot; i do not need to say much , i do not want to disrespect and i am very sorry . &quot;
primark customer , anger at the middle of the store trying to carelessly underwear
the customers did not know what to do when a woman pulled out her clothes to try the panties on the store floor in the middle of primark .
even worse , the woman looked at how she looked at herself , pulled out and raped it again .
he continued to look and later found four pairs of lingerie at the bouverie place shopping center in folkestone .
the place where the woman tried the panties before raffling was the primark store in the bouverie place mall in folkestone
jenny davidson , the mother of two children at the store , said after the mysterious woman tried her underwear that she &quot; went back to the store without buying anything &quot; .
he said : &apos; people could not believe their eyes . &apos; 
he stopped in the middle of the store and took a panty from the window , putting on his pantyhose and pants and putting it on .
&apos;he did not look for a special place to do this , he was in the middle of all disrespect . &apos; 
&apos;everyone was looking at him while he was pulling the panties and it seemed he did not like the panties because he put rafa again . &apos; 
after deciding that he did not like anything , he tried three more clothes and then dressed again and left the store .
&apos;he did not seem to care about those who followed him , and he did not think about the person who would buy the panties he &apos;d later bought . &apos; 
ms. davidson ( 33 ) , who lives in the town , said : &apos; how disgusting it is to think that someone who is worn by someone else , an unclean blanket , will take it and go home . &apos; 
this event took place after lunch on tuesday .
mrs. davidson added : &apos; i think that the staff finds out the clothes after it leaves , so it &apos;s a good thing . &apos; 
&apos;when i took a new panties and went home , it would be really bad to think that someone else put on their panties and came to me without washing . &quot;
a primark spokesperson said : &apos; primark is aware of what &apos;s happening in our store in folkestone on tuesday , august 9th . &apos; 
the related product has been removed from the sale .
how can you protect yourself from armed attacks with krav maga
the outside world is pretty dangerous , but this video from dailymail.com can help you become more secure .
i interviewed rhon mizrachi , the chief master of the new york-based krav maga federation , to learn how to handle nearby armed robbers .
whether you are approaching you from the front or from behind , this video will show you how you can turn the situation against the sordid .
mizrachi tells you that when you approach from behind you turn your face in the face you need to do first and see the attacker and &apos; empty the line of fire &apos; .
then hold the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder and face with your open elbow .
later , when you kneel on your groin , the aggressor &apos;s pain will go up to two levels and you will take it by hand by turning the gun and you will face your face in such a way that the gun is facing towards it and the back of the gun is above the gun .
when the gunman approaches from the front , a similar technique is applied , pulling your body out of the line of fire and turning the gun into a way that the attacker can not fire .
at the same time , giving your weight to the silo , punch the attacker in the chest area , turn the gun and pick it up and point it at him .
is the ear ringing ?
take a look at the video to see how mizrachi does it .
but remember , if you are not a krav maga master , the safest way to avoid every siege is to rob your money .
traveler ian wright drove her language to the most dirty places in europe for travel guide
the british traveler licked some of europe &apos;s most filthy and disgusting places and passed a serious test of his immune system and tingling reflex .
the server and travel writer , suffolk ian wright ( 51 ) , drove a euro banknote , a piccadily circus handrail , a flush button of a train toilet , and a payphone in russia to prove the power of the immune system .
before licking each object , he used a luminometer to show him and what kind of work he was involved with .
however , the experiment , which will be transformed into a film called the lickhiker &apos;s guide to inner strength , gave some surprising results .
although it is extremely disgusting to think of licking a trendy siphon button used by thousands of people , there are actually more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink .
mr. wright interviewed doctors and medical specialists regarding the growth and health of stomach bacteria throughout his european tour .
luckily nothing licked had any effect other than the bad taste left in his mouth .
mr. wright was recognized by touring the world and testing the durability of mides by eating strange and wonderful things .
this task , ranging from general railings at railway stations to toilet flush buttons , has definitely tested the immune system
in the film about it , he said : &apos; i have not been very careful of health since childhood and i have cried many things from the earth , to the worms and muddy water . &apos; 
during the film , it proved the reason for this reputation with certainty .
the only thing he refused was a filthy public toilet in russia .
the swamp sample showed a luminometer count above 4000 units .
if you have to compare it , you need to be under 60 of this number in newly washed hands .
however , when the luminometer count was below 60 in the newly washed hands , a russian public toilet was refused to lick when it exceeded 4000 units
mr wright and fin da dairy producers valio took on the filmmaking of the lickhiker &apos;s guide to inner strength , which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
he said in the film : &apos; it &apos;s close to being one of the worst things i smell in a toilet . &apos; 
nothing can be more dirty than that !
i can not lick anything since it &apos;s disgusting inside .
the lickhiker &apos;s guide to inner strength was prepared in conjunction with fin dairy producer valio .
the company provided mr. wright with lactic acid bacteria , as well as valio gefilus , containing vitamins c and d , which help strengthen gastric bacteria and the immune system .
niko vuorenmaa , valio &apos;s senior vice president of snacks , fruit juices and new categories , said : &quot; we really wanted to present something new to the consumer .
the monitoring is impressive , and at the same time it will explain the benefits of probiotics .
we finally made a lot of crazy brain storms that came up with the idea of &quot; search for ian ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in stomach health has become a global phenomenon
instead of just talking about products , we want to put a much greater context in our products , the good and bad bacteria on our daily basis , the prevalence of stomach health and its connection with the immune system .
the interest in stomach health has become a global phenomenon , and with this documentary we will be able to give consumers more information on this in an interesting way .
at the same time i think filmin shows us that we have a great sense of humor !
tom hakala , who directed the film , added : &quot; i would say that ian had lost some respect for him if he had lived like something in the film like the disgusting russian toilet . &quot;
naturally it is easy for ian to bite some things , but some of them were quite difficult .
i am happy to have received some of these dirty licking actions . &apos;
in a survey conducted by valio in 2015 , 84 percent of respondents said they linked lactic acid bacteria with stomach health and 58 percent said they used products containing lactic acid bacteria at least intermittently .
maganda family destroyed social housing in saltash , cornwall before evacuation
a maganda family left 50,000 pounds worth of damage to the social housing where they were evicted because they feared their neighbors .
after many complaints about tanya skeldon and his wife shaun trebilcock , saltash was kicked out of the house in cornwall .
when they were forcibly removed , the housing association was surprised to see that the authorities were in irreparable condition .
there were large holes in the walls , floor boards were dismantled , garbage was scattered , and wall writings were written on the walls .
the family is now removed from housing and is thought to have benefited from private accommodation options
donna mcevoy , cornwall housing housing manager , said she was afraid the situation was unrecoverable .
he said : &apos; this is really a nightmare for those here , and i think that people should not have to live this way .
there is so much that needs to be taken into account because this property will now be known as a very unpleasant part of cornwall .
this family has a bad reputation and the names have a bad reputation .
the family had three sons who lived in the interim , and according to the police , the family had adopted many frightening behaviors including fighting with the baseball bat in the street , scaring nearby residents , drug use , drug sales and excessive screaming , debate and disbelief .
in june , an antisocial behavior decision was made for skeldon ( 47 ) , whose name is on the kira contract .
the house , which is thought to be destroyed , has old trashes in many rooms
in the past , the property was sold out of the drug store floor boards were removed
neighbors said they saw they were fighting on the street and police were often called
cornwall housing evicted him and his wife forcibly this week after giving them 11 weeks to extend their voluntary relocation .
the evacuation process was met with joy by the relieved neighbors who told them that their lives had turned to nightmare .
one person said : &apos; nobody cares . &apos; 
we have been living side by side with them for 20 years and the situation has always been bad .
if we tell you how many times we &apos;ve seen cops here , you can not believe it .
&apos;this morning , we could not sleep . &apos; 
we were woken up because it was so quiet , we are not used to it !
at last , everything will be great now .
adam fitzpatrick , neighbor sanctions officer of cornwall housing , said the family did not cooperate with the local government .
the family had been living in this house for 20 years and the property was often called the police
garbage and old toys were thrown to the side covered with plants of social housing
he added : &apos; it is really embarrassing that the tenant does not assume any responsibility for the eviction of himself and his family , and evacuation has always been the last resort of cornwall housing .
this was a very difficult occasion , as the behavior was excessive and the actions were frightening enough that neighbors would not have to witness .
i appreciate the efforts of my team , the devon and the cornwall police , and the members of the community brave to give us information .
i hope this development will be understood as a message that neighbors will provide some relief and that antisocial behavior will not be tolerated .
mr. fitzpatrick said that at different times he had three sons who lived in the property but that they were in their 20s .
after the evacuation , one of the bedrooms of the house was left on the floor with a dirty bed
housekeeping workers will have to clean up the rubbish piles surrounding the house
in 2014 , the police found 70 grams of cannabis , weighing scales , special items and £ 1,700 cash on property .
skeldon was sentenced to fines after accepting the offense of possession of class b drugs with intent to sell .
he claimed that he would use the money to buy a tombstone for his son lee skeldon , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
after being homeless , it became clear that tanya and her husband were now in a private residence in plymouth .
most of the rooms of the house had wall writings on the walls .
police stated that they will work to evacuate tenants who violate the tenancy rules
angela crow of devon and the cornwall police force said it was a warning for other tenants who continue to violate the rules .
he said , &apos; this is a message for those who think they can behave as they want without facing any accusation , and for those who think their behavior will be wasted . &apos; 
devon and the cornwall police force , which will continue to work with their partners to protect the community , will never tolerate suicidal and antisocial behavior .
tourists in portugal have fallen in disgust as the airplane flying over the water just crossed the beach
tourists sunbathing in aveiro , portugal , experienced the shock of their lives
portuguese air force p-3c orion &apos;s flight was extremely low
the air force said it was a training flight but insisted there was no safety risk
this is the moment when tourists start to panic as they cross over the jet-laden jet-lagged beach .
in dramatic scenes , a military aircraft approaching the level of sun exposure on the sand in aveiro , north of portugal , is seen .
the holidaymakers came to a standstill because they worried about the noise generated by the jet engines without seeing what was coming towards them from the clouds .
the event , yesterday afternoon , took place in costa nova near aveiro .
daniel fernandes , one of the few holidaymakers who share his dramatic close-up video on social media , said : &apos; it &apos;s really been a couple of times and looks like it &apos;s about to hit at some point . &apos; 
nuno arroja added : &apos; i was surfing and i swear i felt like the plane was going to fall . &apos; 
tourists on the beach in aveiro , when the plane from inside the darkness started flying at extremely low altitude , the horror fell
the portuguese air force announced today that the pilot of the p-3c orion plane is on training flight to identify the fishing boats on the beach and has to travel so far from there that it is the only way to control them .
because of the low visibility due to the smoke coming out of the nearby power-of-fire , the jet said it would fly lower than normal , but the air force insisted that no one &apos;s safety had been put in jeopardy .
this summer , extinguished fires have destroyed certain parts of portugal &apos;s mainland , causing the death of four in the name of madeira .
the portuguese air force stated that today the pilot must fly away from the situation due to the difficult conditions ( heavy fog and smoke from the extinguishing power fires )
the plane was in training flight and was asked to identify pilottan fishing boats as part of the exercise
london girl who participated in isid was killed in syria
it is reported that kadiza sultana , one of the three english girls who left london to join the isid in the past year , died in syria .
attorney tasnime akunjee stated that his family received information about rakka , the death in syria a few weeks ago .
itv news reported thursday that he was killed in a russian air strike on the rakka region , where his group is strong in the country .
sultana was 17 years old and died in a plan to escape from the war-torn country and return to britain , according to his family .
akunjee &quot; we hope that this situation will stress that it is really risky to go to war zones as a tombstone and will for others , and that people will break the courage to make this choice . &quot;
in february 2015 , two sisters from sultana and eastern london boarded a plane to turkey and then a bus to the syrian border .
sultana &apos;s family was told that he married an isİd warrior in syria and remained widowed in months .
reid said he would not give up garland as a candidate for the supreme court if clinton was elected
leader of democrats in senate harry reid said he believes democrats presidential candidate hillary clinton will nominate judge merrick garland for the supreme court if he is elected president .
republicans in the senate have been hampering garland &apos;s ratification process since president barack obama nominated him in march .
senate majority leader mitch mcconnell stated that the new supreme court justice antonin scalia will replace the new president .
in a video interview thursday , reid said he believes clinton will choose garland and &quot; for what it is . &quot;
later , a spokesman for reid said he had not spoken directly with clinton and was speculating that he would not nominate garland .
he hurt garland and said clinton &apos;s team did not want to &quot; break the current situation &quot; by making a new choice .
garland , chief judge of the us court of appeals in columbia .
reid stated that republicans , who prevented garland from nominating him , were &quot; stooges &quot; and &quot; pros &quot; of republican presidential candidate donald trump .
he said trump was not fit for the mission .
treats stated that he was favored by a naked calendar , &apos; as much for men as for women&apos;
the treats magazine is working with the photographer david bellemere to publish a calendar prepared for the year 2017 , inspired by the pirelli of the 1970s .
but instead of celebrities and naked people , they are trying to find a new generation top models for the 2017 nu inspirational percy calendar .
the head of the treats , steve shaw , said earlier this year that the nudity magazine is different from the old playboy , because &quot; playboy is for men . &quot;
i do this for women .
obviously he believes the calendar is the way it is .
shaw said in a press release about the calendar , &quot; we need to go back to exhibiting classical nudity , which is not out of fashion , so that women , like women , can easily look at these images as a source of inspiration . &quot;
women are going to want to be a part of this project because they are a beautiful piece of art .
models can send photos online or participate in open calls in los angeles and new york .
vinyl target : who are the real buyers of the record ?
middle aged , lonely men love vinyl .
let me tell you that this statement is based on the truthfulness before going to the commentary section to make great insults underneath your man .
according to yougov , the return of plaques , which is a subject of much betting , is a result of middle age nostalgia , not of the y belt following the innovation created by a physical object .
most recently vinyl album buyers are between 45 and 54 years old .
as a matter of fact , the 18-24 age group is the least likely .
this is also not only due to the accumulation of enthusiasts , but also has an emotional appeal , older vinyl buyers generally enjoying their emotions ( 56 % and 53 % ) and those who enjoy being alone ( 69 % and 66 % ) .
are the results of mr. yougov correct ?
if this blog was a news story on television , the camera would watch as he walked in a crowded courtyard of soho , walking in a modest gray suit , displaying a lot of gestures before stopping , and then tying his hands together and then saying something authoritarian like : &quot; let &apos;s have a look . &quot;
well , let &apos;s have a look .
as soho &apos;s center slowly loses its charm and extraordinary air ( once the independent retailers are now occupied with hotels , eats , prets and paperchases ) , there are still a few specialist record stores .
i would probably ask for the next part to stop at the cameras , where i stood near the different men in some of these stores and tried to get information about their age and emotional state through observation .
stuart ( 55 ) from glasgow , who followed sister ray ( data count : two young women , three middle-aged men ) to reckless records ( data count : eight middle-aged men , probably a 20 year old woman ) , spends the afternoon for a meeting in london and is browsing the store to fill a few empty hours .
i &apos;m asking if it &apos;s a collector .
&quot; i think it is , &quot; he says .
i have about 3,000 or 4,000 plaques .
the picture above these plaques adorn the walls of the living room ( i sent the picture to me by e-mail , i did not follow it to my house ) .
the reason for the accumulation of so many albums and singles is that it is partly a result of disposable income , it can take the records that money is not enough for the first time , and it can buy back what they have sold during their young and broke .
&quot; most of what i get says that at the beginning of the &apos; 60s , at the beginning of the &apos; 70s , when i was 11 or 12 years old , i was too young to get it , &quot; he says .
he agrees that placards are more likely to be inward-looking people who love to be alone and add : &quot; i do not smoke or drink too much alcohol .
this is my bad habit .
wez ( 25 ) , who works at sister ray , thinks that most of the customers he has met are profiled yougov .
but he also notices that the new wave that is influenced by the exaggerated advertisements on the media , and those who heard that the fashion came back , needed to buy back old plaques .
at the negotiations i made , i understood that in 1998 or 1999 , normally , people stripped off their collections .
customers who previously sold vinyls to buy cds now sell cds to get back the records , &quot; he says .
this may explain the increase in people of a certain age who are revitalizing the vineyard .
what about the alleged emotional preoccupation of the plaques ?
it takes a few moments to realize that in a store like phonica , plaque shops offer a comforting community of similar persons .
according to wez , some older customers were particularly offended by the contactless payment system .
some vinyl buffs may want to take shelter in the stability of familiar plaque covers reminiscent of the overwhelming youthful memories of the digital world .
wez says , &quot; sometimes it may be to fill a gap or see material goods as a kind of comfort . &quot;
i myself have a collector as well as i have this and i think most people are well .
it &apos;s an easy way to fill your head .
&quot; we &apos;re like social workers , &quot; says a colleague who is leaping from a stack of records .
a survey in april revealed that 50 % of vinyl albums in the past month have not yet heard the album .
the survey also showed that 41 % had never bought a vinyl and 7 % had purchased vinyl in the absence of a record label .
at this stage of the news , i was very anxious to look at a series of bossa nova compositions .
the &quot; reward &quot; aspect of this return is also noticed by jonny ( 42 ) , who works in the sounds of universe ( data count : three middle-aged men ) .
&quot; soon somebody came to me and said : &quot; i do not have a record label , but i want to get a radiohead plaque to put in my shelf . &quot;
although it does not represent a large percentage , it certainly reflects the current situation .
more products , less music .
there are those who say : &quot; no recordings . &quot;
these are not old people , young people , those who are at the end of their decades , new entrants to this topic .
now that i &apos;ve had fopp , which has now almost entirely separated a solid for vinyl , i see that the lock is quite variable .
there are couples , photographers , young boys and middle-aged women in their 70s .
it is good to see the diversity among the customers even though the atmosphere is spreading from sex shops above ( the last part of wild beast ) to less serene and loud than jazz with loudspeakers .
none seem to be particularly lonely , but it is difficult to resolve the psychological traumas that disturb them by standing for longer than 30 seconds with someone .
elanora ( 27 ) walks in fopp for a few minutes and looks at the records at the bottom .
instead of spending it , she just came out to look at the showcases .
he says he does not have the option of making a record collection because he does not earn much .
very costly .
it &apos;s easier to listen to music on the computer or in other ways , but the beauty of vinyl is ... &quot; like a loving person , he sighs .
i do not know how to explain it , it &apos;s really not like that .
the last stop is a store that is said to inspire the next generation of vinyl &apos;s passions : urban outfitters .
while observing jeans , i observe a group of young girls gathering around polaroid cameras for a while before a father and daughter argue about buying a crosley record player .
there &apos;s a stairwell filled with records from solda adele , jeff buckley , amy winehouse and fleetwood mac , a must-have record for an average collection , a mix of modern and classic .
nobody looks , maybe they are just for decoration purposes , some are too high to be touched .
it &apos;s a completely &quot; artistic vinyl &quot; .
however , the curiosity about this item may mean that the industry will make more money and send fewer customers to the depths of soho , there are not many issues to complain about .
it is not surprising that a demographic group with more money and time in the majority spends more money on more luxurious items like vinyl .
my findings , however , show that yougov &apos;s results are at least as accurate at soho &apos;s record stores as they do not count the number of female collectors and vinyl enthusiasts who are actually in record stores or online forums .
these people are probably working very hard at school or in offices .
these people certainly do not spend their thursday evenings escaping the sight of a 30-year-old fake television host , staring at record stores on berwick street , examining the records and looking over the shoulders of middle-aged men who have never heard of anything .
greenland shark , the longest living vertebrate living in the world - video news
scientists have explained that the greenland shark has the longest life span in the planet &apos;s vertebrates .
julius nielsen , who works on the sharks , stated that the record belongs to a five-meter-long dentition , thought to be between 272 and 512 years old
french court rejects proposal to demolish stores in jungle refugee camp
a court in france rejected the proposal made by the calais authorities to demolish dozens of competing stores and restaurants in the jungle camp where thousands of refugees lived .
at the court hearing this week , calais officials argued that the government should destroy a total of 72 shelters , which sells many items from camp to cigarettes to energy drinks , hair cuts or tea for 50 cents ( 40p ) or basic meals for a few euros .
the governor of calais argued that these places had to be demolished because they created a parallel economy of unpaid taxes and risked fire and hygiene .
helpful groups have stated that the court is vital for shops and restaurants , and that free food offered by state-sponsored organizations and other groups is not sufficient for the growing population of the camp .
grocery stores and restaurants often offer shelter and free food to people in need .
a court in lille stated that there were no legal grounds for deporting people who operated 72 gross merchandise shops , but the concerns of the governor of calais were &quot; completely understandable &quot; .
judge jean-françois mulla stated that groceries , cafes and restaurants play a much larger role than simply nourishing people who live &quot; in extremely dangerous conditions &quot; .
he stated that these areas provide comfortable meeting points for refugees and volunteers .
one of the places under risk of collapse is the not-for-profit jungle book for children café , offering 200 meals every day , offering english and french lessons , where hundreds of minors are given advice on refugee asylum .
more than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect this cage for children .
in a letter to the guardian , this closure was said to be &quot; a disaster for some of the children who are eight years old . &quot;
two charitable institutions , help refugees and l &apos;auberge des migrants , predicted friday that the number rose to more than 9.000 ( the highest ever today ) in the population at jungle camp after increasing arrivals in summer .
in the fiji mastery class , britain was dominated by the silver medal in the rugby seventh championship
the impressive progress of great britain &apos;s rugby 7 championship ended in a final on thursday with fiji after a 43-7 defeat at rio deodoro stadium .
fiji gave master classes on grip , rust , side step , support , running lines and muscle strength to get the gold medal , the first olympic medal in every color .
after the defeat , britain received the third silver medal of the day as a not so bad consolation award and could now be proud of their efforts in the olympic 7 opening tournament , which they defeated new zealand , argentina and south africa .
at the beginning of the day , they could have found them in the finals after the south african team , who crushed 7-5 in the semi-finals .
but fiji , which was so formidable , could even beat a team of 15 .
although not very believable , perhaps britain can find comfort at least one british looking for a gold medal tomorrow : fiji &apos;s chief coach , ben ryan , an englishman from wimbledon .
this was a very challenging journey for great britain .
eight ways ago , when they worked with ryan they lost every game in the adelaide sevens championship .
this time , only one is lost .
although this disgrace is painful , the progress shown is truly astonishing .
fiji made a fascinating start , players bounced over the attempts of great britain to take the ball .
it seemed to run between captain tom mitchell and his team for a series of moving busses , and when the world series champions , osea kolinisao , moved in from the corner , they advanced 5-0 .
on the fourth minute , jerry tuwai faced with another number of right-handed flanks .
the match was 12-0 and great britain could hardly touch the ball .
mitchell &apos;s great intervention , like the mountain , prevented leone nakarawa from throwing the third , but it was only delaying the number of fiji .
on the seventh minute , jasa veremalua scored in the right-hand corner and united kingdom fell 17-0 .
with only one minute left in the first half , nakarawa came all over again and made another number .
later vatemo ravouvou flew straight for the number , passing through some of the toughest british interventions .
with this number , the score between the circuit reached 29-0 .
a team that was set up to play in the fiji 7 championship , great britain seemed to be trying to learn the basics of business yet .
this is more or less the case .
great britain made major changes between the circuit and closed the fiji dam , which lasted four minutes , which was a good development compared to the first half , until josua tuisova came out on stage with the perfect fiji game .
dan norton had a trial for great britain and tried to score the left-hand corner to score 36-7 , but the fans of the game were in the hands of the south sea islands singing , flagging and dancing .
it was really hard not to admire fiji &apos;s cheerful approach from start to finish .
maa viliame worshiped the last additions to the fiji game , which did not have to be dressed in the last minute .
when the whistle struck , the fijian started the celebration and great britain held the way to the locker room as it suffered .
earlier in the day , fiji defeated japan 20-5 in the semi-finals , while great britain faced south africa in a tough semi-final encounter , with britain leading the way .
kyle brown put forward the south african team in the first half , but dan norton took the lead in the second half with dizzy feet .
anthony &apos;s brother marcus watson , who is in the top 15 of england , has won a great victory and a silver medal .
helen glover and heather stanning are inspired by their coach &apos;s battle with cancer
in these games there will be no more emotional gold medals , which has an important meaning .
helen glover and heather stanning realized that the moment they won the gold in estacio da lagoa could be much more meaningful .
although there were two shoemakers , three on the boat , the women were the first women to reach such a level in britain this year in the double race , while robin williams , the voice of her coach robin williams , was echoing on the boat as they progressed to the second gold olympic medal in succession .
their sovereignty was clear , it was their 39th race of unprecedented invincibility .
although we see two great athletes floating on the surface in swan elegance , this image does not exactly reflect the quality of the victory .
behind each rowing gold medal , there is a battalion of willing hands that provide the incremental gains that make this difference , and no hand was as effective as a coach who did not know if he would live to see this day when cancer was diagnosed 30 months ago .
as he said , they are tangled and gone .
i got caught in the kind of bladder cancer that could be intervened surgically and they did it .
if they do not do it , they go everywhere .
that would be a pretty bad situation .
it changes your vision a little bit .
williams was diagnosed in december 2013 .
the trio was very lucky that he could start treatment outside of the season , early 2014 , so it is not known if this is the case , but this distraction will be the least .
i had to pay for it , so i had to recover quickly .
it was an incentive for me .
i was at the hospital and walked 6 , 9 , 15 meters in the garden , although i told them it was enough to take a few steps .
it started like this .
rowing is a journey on its own , but that makes it a little bigger .
he was in williams , who had a tense morning talking after his victory a bit more than usual to overcome his own worries .
stanning , who was a captain in the royal artillery and who had previously gone to afghanistan , said , &quot; i was feeling emotionally depressed this week , maybe it is a bit excessive , but it really means a lot . &quot;
it emphasizes once again what it means to me and how much work helen , i and robin do .
i spent three wonderful years with helen and robin .
i would like to extend my best thanks to him for being the best coach in the world for this reason that we would not be without robin .
i could not find a better person or better trainer to work .
helen glover and heather stanning have not lost the race for five years .
the duo have a tough rhythm that their opponents can not reach .
stanning and glover &apos;s power has not yet been exhausted , even in the last 500 meters , when new zealand and denmark teams shut down .
we had ourselves trapped .
helen &apos; watch the process , watch the process &apos; he called .
it &apos;s really important to be trapped .
we had a good start and we were not trying to do anything incredible .
we did not expect fireworks to explode today , we just wanted to win the race we went out with good paddling , which we did .
the pair will take a year off before deciding what to do in the future .
there is a wedding glover has to attend next month , his and his television adventurer steve backshall &apos;s wedding .
for now he just wants to enjoy this moment .
i did not want to say it was my last race .
this would create too much pressure .
i did not realize i was an olympic champion in london , it took six months .
it was very new and very stressful .
here , it took about four minutes .
it &apos;s a much better feeling . &quot;

snapchat &quot; anime &quot; effect , criticized as asian cartoon
although snapchat said it was inspired by animations for this filter , some observers say it is racially insensitive .
snapchat , with the lens tool every day around 150 million users change the reality of the absurd level by playing with their identity allows .
you can turn yourself into a mother-of-pearl , a dog , or a character that has risen from a roy lichtenstein picture .
lenses are reckless , feature-changing vehicles that generate over 30 million reflections each day .
the wrong steps are quickly dug into the memory of the cam .
snapchat lenses have faced accusations in the past that the practitioner supports black classification or offers whitened skin tones as a beauty ideal .
because of this reason , some critics have criticized the company for being an &quot; asian mask &quot; that caricatures asians because of this week , users have slit-eyed , distorted teeth and swollen cheeks .
and they wonder whether these recurring conflicts point to a bigger problem with the company &apos;s diversity .
news and anger spread on wednesday with the verge and motherboard &apos;s news , and the day after , snapchat announced that he had removed the feature .
the company said in a statement : the lens was prepared not for the cartooning of the asians but for the anime characters .
but for observers with racism experience , this lens reminded us of painful stereotypes .
he generally refused to compare the anime to other people .
grace sparapani , a korean-american art student and tweeted about the photos , said that in an e-mail , your lens is &quot; painful and uncomfortable with the slightest expression &quot; .
&quot; he added that it is difficult to discuss the side-by-side comparison of the effects of the bad asian cartoons and the effects of the filter , when it comes to the subject .
this shows that the filter is not only an asian mask , but also an insulting asian mask .
snapchat is not the only company that transcends cultural trigger mechanisms .
american culture seems to be endlessly in conflict with the many diversity and inclusiveness of institutions , from meeting rooms to hollywood and the devices it carries in all our hands .
and it can be interpreted that snapchat &apos;s appeal to the racial diversity of the larger young mass , which is more numerous than its counterparts , might be in a higher expectation of tenderness .
in an interview thursday , katie zhu , 25 , said one of snapchat &apos;s lenses created a humiliating image for a user , saying &quot; it &apos;s much harder not to be noticed as such . &quot;
on thursday , ms. zhu , a product manager and engineer working for medium , decided to delete the snapchat account and everyone called it .
in an interview with the article and telephone she wrote for medium , she said she believed that race-related conflicts reflected deficiencies in diversity in recruitment practices at snapchat .
ms. zhu criticized the leader team of white men , the majority of whom ended the article with a label : # snapchatisilin .
ms. zhu , a chinese-born american , said , &quot; because of the lack of diversity among different breeds of personnel , they can make such decisions , or if they are working in different races , they do not feel safe or comfortable enough to speak for themselves . &quot;
other observers share his views on this complaint that snapchat left unanswered .
the company emphasizes the private company situation and does not share figures about the diversity among the staff .
on thursday , snapchat refused to share its staff &apos;s racial origins , but according to a spokesperson , the company recently added a recruitment responsibility to focus on undersuffled populations and to increase their inclusion efforts internally .
ms. zhu , for her own sake , stated that she would keep the snapchat account closed and added , &quot; i am wondering if there are more users like us who can tell if this is not true . &quot;
congress panel , military officials say fraud in isiid intelligence
a thursday report , a congress panel , reported that the united states central command authorities falsified intelligence reports to draw a more optimistic picture of events on the war against the islamic state in iraq and syria .
an interim report prepared by a working group led by the republican chiefs of staff of the house armed services committee , the intelligence committee and the defense compensation subcommittee found that the top officers had &quot; widespread dissatisfaction &quot; among the central command intelligence analysts , who said the us forces had changed the islamic state &apos;s assessments .
central command , known as centcom , is a military headquarters in tampa , fla . , which supervises us military operations in the middle east and central asia .
&quot; the intelligence results approved by senior centcom leaders are typically more positive than the realities of the us anti-terrorism efforts show , and consistently provide much more positive results than the analysis of the other elements of the intelligence community . &quot; in a report on the report ,
&quot; what happened at centcom is unacceptable , &quot; said ken calvert , a california republican representative . &quot; our warriors are troubled by bad analysis of senior decision-making bodies . &quot;
the leadership failures at centcom have reached the top levels of the organization .
the 10-page report also provided details of the persistent problems of 2014 and 2015 , which were included in the central command &apos;s analysis and analysis of america &apos;s efforts to provide training to iraqi forces .
although there is no definite evidence that senior obama administration officials have ordered changes to the reports , it is clear that analysts feel pressured by centcom leaders to offer a more optimistic view of the threat created by the islamic state , also known as iŞİd and daeŞ .
raporda &quot; in the first half of 2015 , many central command press bulletins , statements and congressional statements are said to be more positive than actual events &quot; .
for example , a centcom official stated that a major military offensive for the withdrawal of mosul , open to the public , could be held as early as april or may 2015 .
mosul , iraq &apos;s second largest city , is still under the control of the islamic state .
mike pompeo , republican representative of kansas , said in a statement , &quot; this has been clearly understood after months of research . &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to mid-2015 , the most senior intelligence leaders of the united states central command manipulated the commander &apos;s intelligence results so that the threat posed by isid in iraq would be unimportant .
the republicans formed a work force after learning that analysts expressed concern about the manipulation of intelligence about the islamic state .
as the reviews continue , the report on thursday will be followed by much more comprehensive findings .
there is another centcom intelligence review conducted by the general inspector of the ministry of defense .
democrat members of the house intelligence committee also published their findings on thursday , participating in some of the conclusions of the republican task force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , centcom has created a very narrow-minded process of intelligence assessments of the dae and the iraqi security forces , &quot; democrat leader of the committee , representative adam b. schiff , said in a statement .
according to mr. schiff , this process &quot; has delayed the publication of intelligence results &quot; , has led to morale among analysts and &quot; has not given enough room for opposing views &quot; .
however , mr. schiff and the democrats have stated that the white house has not reached a conclusion that centcom analysts are pressuring their conclusions to &quot; make a pre-determined or political statement &quot; .
the preliminary results of the congressional review were announced on tuesday by the daily beast .
in august , the new york times reported that a pentagon inspector general review opened after complaints made by centcom analysts .
upper lieutenant commander patrick evans , as a pentagon spokesman , said in a statement that the general inspector would not comment on the congress report of the department of defense during the ongoing investigation .
however , he said that &quot; experts in some cases may fall into disagreement about the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence community and the ministry of defense have supported a healthy dialogue on these important national security issues &quot; .
the research will raise echoes in iraq and syria beyond the question of whether the bombing operation on the us front is continuing ( which is a case by day more defense authority ) .
however , last year &apos;s accusations have raised questions about how much president obama can rely on the central command for honest evaluations of military operations in iraq , afghanistan , libya and other crisis spots .
critics of the reflection of islamic state intelligence have begun when centcom intelligence analyst gregory hooker wrote an article describing that the administration of president george w. bush , despite the objection of many analysts , held a small force in iraq and did not think enough about the 2003 invasion .
mr. hooker also played an important role in the revolt against the islamic state intelligence .
officials said mr. hooker &apos;s team reached the conclusion that the air attacks against rafiniers held by the islamic state in spite of the public statements on the other hand last year had built temporary refineries to sell petroleum on the black market , and that the terrorist group had no significant impact on its financial resources .
however , as the times noted in september , this finding did not go beyond the central command .
centcom &apos;s then commander , general lloyd j. austin iii , was exposed to criticism last year when his statement in the senate was seen by many legislators as a highly positive assessment of the war .
general austin retired in april and received his position at the central command general joseph l. votel .
us women &apos;s lawn hockey team prepares to face britain wins 4th victory in back row
katie bam scored the first two goals of the united states women &apos;s grass hockey team on thursday when the americans beat india 3-0 , one day after scoring three goals in a 6-1 victory against japan .
bam ( 27 ) said he was not sure if he had done the same thing before , though five goals in two games seemed to require a lasting skill .
he said , &quot; there is no idea . &quot;
i &apos;m not one of those people who keep their record of their goals .
it is reported that the americans share the first place in the group with britain , leading 4-0 in the olympic tournament and continuing to defeat japan on thursday after defeating 2-0 .
britain and the united states will face saturday &apos;s final game of the first round .
both teams qualify for the quarter-finals and the match will determine who will win the first and who will finish the second match of the six-team group .
the team , who finished first in the group matches , will not face a stronger dutch team with another group leader when the quarterfinals begin .
however , after saturday &apos;s game , the americans made a surprising progress here after the london olympics , where the last of the 12 teams arrived .
bam was on this team .
he grew up in blue bell , pa . , when he was 3 years old when he first took the grass hockey bat ( his twin brothers were interested in this sport in drexel ) and joined the national team at the age of 16 , becoming the team &apos;s youngest player .
he missed the 2008 olympics because he could not enter the last squad .
then came the year 2012 when he and his teammates did not do much of anything .
the following year , a british coach , craig parnham , brought in the referral and things started to change .
bam says , &quot; a cultural change , a mental change , a physical change . &quot;
we are no longer working like in london .
we have completely gone through the transformation .
thursday night , bam took the first number of the first half with a close knock .
india has not yet won a win in the tournament , but the team was able to maintain a surprising level of strength and keep the score at 1-0 until bam &apos;s third quarter .
he made a long run from the left side of the field and then curled into the ball and the americans advanced 2-0 .
melissa gonzales scored the last goal in the middle of the fourth quarter .
this is the first time united states goalkeeper jackie briggs , who allowed one goal in the first three victories , did not eat goals in the tournament .
chance opened .
so is bam .
&quot; we are in a good place right now , &quot; parnham said , but how good this place is depends on saturday &apos;s game .
trampoline calm in the middle of the olympic tide
wherever you are , no matter how many hours , the olympics continue .
the events in rio de janeiro represent ambition and competition , and it seems like it will never end or be avoided .
the olympic torch itself is like a flaming baton from a swimmer , a gymnast , and a triathloncaster from there .
simone biles , katie ledecky or michael phelps and chad le clos can not watch television , hear the newspaper or listen to what your neighbors say in a café without hearing about the contention between michael phelps and chad le clos .
and there &apos;s logan dooley .
mr. dooley , who participated in the olympics for the first time , may be one of the names shown at prime time , like a swimmer , a gymnast or a fencer like a swimmer , among tv advertisements that promise to feel good about sponsorships .
however , mr. dooley from lake forest , calif . ( 28 ) is fighting for the gold medal in the tram at the olympics .
the olympic flame does not illuminate every event on an equal level .
far from the center , there are sports that are not universally recognized , partly in the shadow : air rifle shooting , archery , badminton , taekwondo .
always breaststroke with us , as long as it is .
but personally , to mention my favorite , i would like to draw attention to the secret magic of the trampoline .
although the trampoline has been recognized as an olympic event since 2000 when it was introduced to the sydney games , very few people i &apos;ve asked in the intervening 16 years have not realized that it is an olympic sport .
this could be a regional ignorance .
although the united states submitted athletes for the competition , they never won a medal in the tram and there was no contestant rising to the finals until 2012 .
in men , the rewards tended to share the chinese and russians , while in women the chinese and canadians shared .
dong dong from china and rosie maclennan from canada will try to protect the gold medals they receive in london this year .
however , trampolines are often pointed out as an oppressive event , which may be partly due to unconscious minds thinking that they deserve clown school instead of the olympics .
i have to admit i &apos;m not an expert here , i just have an interest in the subject .
it has a funny potential ( like the cartoon-like tremor created by the never-ending jumper ) , but it also reflects the elegance of gymnastics and diving , which are basically two sports they put together .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the spanish hand trampolin word , which means &quot; trampoline &quot; .
champion candidates leap 30 feet above the air in a large trampoline and are asked to perform a series of moves ( sprains , pikes , and saltoes ) before they land on their feet .
according to the official olympic program , performance is evaluated according to difficulty and &quot; flight time &quot; .
in rio there will be thirty-two athletes , 16 men and 16 women from 17 countries .
the most common progress in the olympics is directly advanced .
the medal smugglers must go faster and higher in search of gold , in some cases to the finish point , in some cases backward , more upwards and downwards .
they are not just after the finish line or the starting wall , but there is another tough line in the broadcast on tv , the world or the olympic record .
this enthusiastic endeavor is noble , imperialistic , and even at extreme levels , enough to drown a viewer even in tears .
but this is precisely what i find slightly tiring when watching the games .
the trampoline allows you to take a break from all that .
the trampoline moves upwards .
goals are not moving forward .
the upward spike , like an astronaut , looks up weightless , goes up , goes up effortlessly , and goes up effortlessly .
of course , it can not be said that there is no competition or difficulty , but during the routine it is a feverish work to reach the result , there is no disappearance in the distance , only the graceful hanging of time and space as imagination .
how calm an olympic race can be so calm .
the order of the women and their finals will be arranged at 13.00 after friday afternoon , with the eastern time and the men again at 13 on saturday .
nbc will broadcast the finals on both days , starting at 14.00 as a block after lunch .
in the midst of the olympic madness , they promise a silent and wonderful moment that can be ignored in the general struggle .
and according to the wall street journal of consciousness , we can say that mr. dooley is waiting for new fans if he is to present a male athlete just to browse and object , as recently suggested by united states male gymnasts .
the long-standing us in ethiopia , the allies , &quot; protest in a generation &quot;
violent protest in ethiopia
demonstrators who demanded political change in ethiopia compared the government with violent resistance .
witnesses say a large number of protesters have received deadly weapons bombs in the fight with the police .
is ethiopia about to collapse ?
in the past decade , it has become one of africa &apos;s most stable nations and a fast-growing economy and a solid ally for the west .
however , anti-government protests , which we have been making over the past few months , have been spreading more and more territory every day .
just the week we passed , thousands of people went out and asked for basic political change .
according to human rights groups , the reaction to the government was very cruel .
witnesses said police officers shot and killed a large number of unarmed demonstrators .
in the protest images , which are believed to be from the end of the year or the beginning of this year , there are security officials who flog the young people who have to stand on their hands against a wall .
at the highest level , the united nations human rights authority is now seeking a thorough review .
&quot; it is always difficult to keep this country together and it will be much harder to progress , &quot; said rashid abdi , project director of the somali peninsula of the international crisis group , a research group .
ethiopia is the nation with the highest population of africa after nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the west .
the us military and intelligence services are working closely with the ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region , particularly in somalia , and there are very few countries in africa that have received such assistance from the west .
the economy of ethiopia is growing impressively .
the infrastructure has been improved effectively , and there is even a new suburban train in the capital addis ababa .
and the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean .
although the best example of democracy is not displayed in ethiopia ( human rights groups are constantly at the mercy of the government &apos;s oppressive attitude ) , domestic opposition was rather limited , opponents were effectively silenced .
most were sent to exile , imprisoned , murdered , or driven to the farthest corners of the desert .
however , this situation may be changing .
seyoum teshome , a university lecturer from central ethiopia , said , &quot; if you do not give people any choice but to protest the people , these things will happen . &quot;
youth is in full protest .
in a generation protest .
there are many complaints from the land use to the repression that the ruling coalition has about power .
after the highly criticized election of the past year , the ruling party and its allies have taken the last seat filled by the opponents and can now control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time , the tensions on the border are also rising with eritre , a sharp and controversial line that led to the war in which hundreds of people lost their lives in june .
analysts are afraid that separatist groups , such as the oromo freedom front or the ogaden national liberation front , have been re-armed with such bureaucrats .
there are a few factors that explain why the painful feelings that have been burning under the surface for years are now exploding .
the first looks innocent : smartphones .
as cheap smartphones became more widespread and internet service became available , only a few years ago , a large number of ethiopians began using social media to communicate .
the government could communicate via internet proxy servers , often hiding their location , even when they closed their access to facebook and twitter as often as they did during protests .
a few young ethiopians said they were collecting for protesters this way .
secondly , solidarity between the two major ethnic groups of ethiopia , the oromos and amharas , has also increased .
oromolar and amharas are not normally ally .
for a long time , from the predominantly christian mountainous regions of ethiopia , amharas prevailed in politics and business , exploiting oromols , who were mostly muslims and lived on flat land .
however , this situation also changes .
&quot; we are moving forward to cooperate under an umbrella and cooperate , &quot; said mulatu gemechu , an oromo leader .
the biggest protests were seen in amhara and oromo .
most amhara and oromo think ethiopia is dominated by members of the tigrayan ethnic group , which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and is dominant in the military , intelligence services , trade and politics .
the third reason behind unrest was the death of meles zenawi .
former rebel leader mr. meles served as prime minister of ethiopia for 17 years until death from an illness unexplained in 2012 .
it was thought to be a tactical genius , seeing that everyone could not see .
analysts say he is particularly well-versed in identifying the first signs of discomfort and restraining and neutralizing the opponents .
&quot; the current regime does not have this basic knowledge , &quot; said confederate analyst mr. abdi .
ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , hailemariam desalegn , was chosen with relative uncertainty to replace mr. meles .
unlike mr. meles , who comes from the tigray area of northern ethiopia , mr. hailemariam is south .
analysts say he has not gained the security of the security services tigrayans control .
as a result more bloodshed with more fear .
ethiopia &apos;s recent experience of such confusion was the protest after theft of thousands of analysts in 2005 after an election by the government .
in the ensuing measures , many protesters were murdered , although the amount of light we passed was low , and this period of confusion also went relatively quickly .
development experts have sought ethiopia &apos;s leaders for visionary infrastructural planning , like the new commuter train , and for the tremendous progress on the fight against poverty .
it is clear , however , that this does not stop the growing interest in the ethiopian government .
and it &apos;s getting dangerous and ethnical .
in the past month , protesters in gondar , an amharan town , have attacked businesses that own tigrayans , and tigrayan hatred has also increased in the social media .
analysts say the protests have left all other allies in the united states and the west in a strange state .
the us government used ethiopia as a base for unmanned aerial flights over neighboring somalia , but recently it was said that this base was closed .
while the west clearly wants to support democracy , it does not want this ally in a fragile region to break down .
mr. abdi said &quot; this &quot; and added , &quot; it &apos;s like walking on a very thin rope . &quot;
donald trump announces his obligation to make obsession with isiid as &quot; cynicism &quot;
on friday , donald j. trump insisted on several occasions during the past few weeks that president obama and hillary clinton were not serious when they claimed to be the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group of the islamic state , trying to remove the last dispute around the campaign .
this statement raised new questions about the republican presidential candidate &apos;s ability to communicate clearly with the american public .
at the same time , in the process of creating this turbulent process , they tried to explain the statement that this is not what they imply , which implicitly implied their deeds to defend him .
mr. trump further intensified his thesis on thursday after taking the initiative at a wednesday night rally , insisting that the president and mrs. clinton really implied establishing the isid in the interviews .
but on friday , early in the morning on twitter , mr trump said he was just making a cynical statement .
the shipment showed that mr. trump had completely stepped back from a day before he was expressing seriousness in the allegations in a series of interviews .
conservative radio programmer hugh hewitt recalled that mr obama wanted to destroy the isid , and when mr trump tried to help him soften the interpretation , the republican presidential candidate said he did not believe it .
mr. trump , the last chaos arose while trying to change the focus of his campaign after the drop in the polls .
mr trump and mrs. clinton talked confidently about the economy this week in michigan .
on friday , mr. trump wanted to return to this topic .
she also spoke on twitter , saying that mrs. clinton &apos;s proposals would increase taxes and she found it boring to speak .
mr. trump has used his mock defenses before .
towards the end of july , after seeing the russians suggest a pirate attack on ms. clinton &apos;s e-mails , after having met with great criticism , she said , &quot; of course i say this in a sarcastic way . &quot;
this approach allows mr. trump to push the boundaries of political speech and to step back where it is needed .
&quot; it &apos;s a scheme that allows certain messages to &quot; explain &quot; depending on the reaction , testing how they react by their supporters , &quot; said ruth sherman , a communications expert who follows both candidates .
at the same time , however , he gives these declarations intentionally and knows that it is unclear enough to be filtered out when viewed from different lenses .
after falling in the polls in the past few days , mr. trump took a more aggressive stance instead of softening the air for the general election mass .
a new nbc / wall street journal / marist poll released on friday showed mr. trump is well behind miss clinton in north coraline , virginia and colorado , and that there is a tight race in florida .
although mr. trump usually refuses to apologize for provocative things he accuses himself of criticizing his words or misunderstanding his humor .
however , mr. trump &apos;s jokes , which have been subject to much more scrutiny in the last months of his presidential campaign , have challenged the loyal supporters who have to support it in public , no matter how provocative their comments are .
former new york city mayor rudolph w. giuliani made an effort to defend the island in an interview with cnn on thursday as one of mr. trump &apos;s most prominent supporters .
when mr. trump was asked about the correctness of his thesis that mr. obama and mrs. clinton had established the islamic state , mr. giuliani said , &quot; i think he is making a legitimate , political critique . &quot;
from a standpoint , obama was a small organization , unknown before isaid , those who found them charming were completely wrong and this happened because of the withdrawal of troops from iraq .
most prominent republicans are trying to argue that the obama administration , which has made the foreign ministry of ms. clinton , fail to aggressively deal with the situation in the middle east and cause the isid to grow .
before the rallies in pennsylvania on friday , trump continues to blame the news media on twitter for distorting every word and treating it as biased .
&quot; they can not do it ! &quot; he mocked with &quot; poor , pathetic &quot; television specialists trying to solve him .
some democrats ridiculed mr. trump &apos;s pretext , saying it was evidence that he was not in line with the presidency .
the cafeteria that can not beat time &apos;s prices again at greenpoint
verb cafe , a cash-only old-fashioned place in williamsburg , offered wi-fi connectivity , but for 15 years it offered great coffee .
naturally , he could not afford the prices at bedford avenue &apos;s store .
in the summer of 2014 , the store , which is located at the verb , sells soap cherie cap shaped cake soaps .
the inhabitants of the area were close , expressing that this was the last loss of the city that had been censored .
artist molly crabapple wrote to twitter : &quot; new york is a change , i know that , but i still can not believe that the cbgb is gone and the chelsea hotel is vacated and the verb is no longer a soap store . &quot;
but do not reinvent as much as new york is change city .
in november we opened a renewed verb cafe in greenpoint , less than a mile from the original location , in the north .
the new verb cafe has wi-fi connectivity and accepts credit cards , but it protects some older employees and similar basic air .
the coffee is still good .
at the beginning of the new verb , there is cisco rodriguez , the owner and general manager of the new site , which has been working for a long time in the old café .
he joined the verb in 2001 and stayed until the end .
a customer said he would be thrilled to do so when he offered him financing for this new location .
mr. rodriguez ( 36 ) left most things the same .
verb used the same distributor for bagels and bought an espresso machine in the same model .
even the lights of the old verb were reused here .
however , mr. rodriguez said he wanted to present a bit of different experiences .
he added new materials .
pastrami-egg-and-cheese sandwiches are available on the menu and ingredients such as capers and sauteed onions are also available .
there are brown-brass crowns .
the cafe does not serve beer anymore , but offers fresh fruit juices .
nine months later , mr. rodriguez said he realized that the old regulars had begun to arrive decisively .
&quot; many of our old customers could not handle the prices in williamsburg , &quot; he said .
on sunday , rebecca oliveira was one of these customers .
mrs. oliveira ( 34 ) lives in williamsburg and frequently goes to the verb .
even after he moved to greenpoint , he did not give up on this road .
verb said that after a moment he paused to drink coffee for a while .
&quot; i realized that what i love is coffee and culture in the verb , &quot; he said .
he began to drink coffee again , but the other day he chose the mushroom mixture , which is a new addition to the usual iced coffee .
another regulant , tom rosenthal , has regularly gone to verb since 2003 .
he goes there before the work and always orders the same .
&quot; every day , a quarter of a century past , i went in without a doubt and they were ready for my every day buttery bagel order , &quot; he said .
photo mr. rodriguez said he wanted to make changes and added new items to the menu .
nowadays , mr. rosenthal is still taking the usual order , but sometimes he makes some changes by adding bacon , eggs and cheese to his daily bagel order .
mr. rodriguez said he was not uncomfortable with the soap store that was located in the old room .
as a matter of fact , the owners of soap cherie offered to make a special soap for verb using the cold steaming cup of the café .
&quot; i think we can still accept this offer , &quot; mr. rodriguez said .
and greenpoint &apos;s traditional polish inhabitants adopted this cage .
one of the new customers translated the menu into the polish and mr. rodriguez said that his new neighbors would soon find a place to display this barn to make them feel good .
the new location also has other advantages .
the local fruit juice store wants to brew and sell cold infused coffee .
there is a possibility that the café can be expanded by spreading to the adjacent building .
it is enough for most customers to have a new verb to find their old favorites .
joseph whitt was a regular customer and was very upset after the room was closed .
when the new venue opened , mr. whitt said he could feel at home because he could get in and have coffee .
&quot; i had to smell it , &quot; he said .
the depressive food of the time of the crisis &quot; a square meal &quot;
in march 1933 , immediately after his sitting in the chairman &apos;s chair , franklin delano roosevelt sat for lunch at the oval office .
president roosevelt , a throat-loving man , loved the fancy fifth avenue food , such as goose juice and maryland turtle soup .
that day menu was much more modest : boiled egg with tomato sauce , potato roots and dry plum pudding as dessert .
&quot; this was an act of solidarity with the people who suffered , &quot; said jane ziegelman .
his wife andrew coe added : &quot; this was also a message given to americans about how to eat their food . &quot;
the couple who lives in brooklyn heights is a food historian .
mr. coe &apos;s last book , &quot; chop suey , &quot; was about chinese cuisine in america , and ms. ziegelman was telling about the lives of the geese in the lower east region in his book &quot; 97 orchard . &quot;
the new book , a square meal , which will be published by harper on tuesday , tells the history of american food during the great depression .
they also met with a reporter for dinner at the eisenberg sandwich buffet in flatiron , which has been present since 1929 , the year the crisis began , showing solidarity for food .
mrs. ziegelman ( 54 ) ordered cream cheese and olive sandwiches , while mr. coe ( 57 ) chose turkey , potato and vegetable seats .
the couple found that the reporter &apos;s roll dumplings order was suitable for discussion of the crisis-era foods .
&quot; nuts were very popular , &quot; said ms. ziegelman .
there was ground nut , liver nut , and dry bean nut .
they were made from a cheap material that was able to spread the material with a material .
imagine that you eat as much peanuts as you eat at dinner .
mr. coe squeezed his face .
&quot; like a bullet , a man must be seated in the middiness , &quot; he said .
in the years prior to the crisis , especially in rural areas , the american buffet was like an open buffet .
the women were cooking for men working on the farm and freshly cooked pies were served for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
the european americans who died starving in world war i were sending food , &quot; a square meal &quot; explains the history of the ways of dealing with the emergence of the nation as an abundance center .
&quot; it was a time when your meal became a central , worrying issue for americans , &quot; mr. coe said while explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it .
the new budget regime was equally alarming : mysterious foods such as nuts and casseroles became the main consumption item , according to ms. ziegelman , &quot; casseroles were a great way to evaluate the remaining meals &quot; so that the cooks could hide the appetizer-lowering ingredients with a cream sauce .
fresh fruits were replaced by cheaper dried fruits .
over the years , meat in the center of american cuisine has become a frugal luxury .
interesting mixtures for calorie and nutritional value were tried and the feeling of satisfaction passed before taste or general culinary conception .
when ms. ziegelman was researching the book , which included recipes , she prepared an onion eaten in a peanut butter fillet of that turn .
&quot; it was not a popular contribution to dinner tonight , &quot; mr. coe said .
ms. ziegelman supported it : &quot; it was real . &quot;
peanut butter has no joints with the onion in the flour .
this is an outstanding feature in most home economy recipes .
home economists , including louise stanley , who was also the head of the federal home economics bureau , directed the country &apos;s eating habits as never before .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to be &quot; savvy &quot; and waged a struggle to transform slurries such as carrot cream spaghetti into tasty foods .
&quot; a square meal &quot; is a feast of historical delicacies .
the responses given by president herbert hoover to the government &apos;s hungry citizens , like the pie-eating attitude , are highly appetizing .
on the one hand , he was cooking a simple iowa farmer &apos;s meal in the public childhood , like a millionaire intellectual , on the other hand .
mr. coe said , &quot; he loved eating european culinary delicacies like cucumber sauce fish . &quot;
he was eating almost all of the gold-plated food in the dining room , wearing jackets suitable for dinner .
it is far from the truth .
although his wife eleanor did not encourage him to be an example with the mide , president roosevelt could have fallen into the same mistake .
according to the book , when mrs. roosevelt recruited an assistant who did not care for flavor , the white house began offering only the &quot; most dreadful food , but also the most dreary plates prepared &quot; to date .
after the country was back on its feet , most of the methods of cooking during the crisis were left on the edge .
according to ms. ziegelman , the focus on calorie and nutrition and the way in which science is applied to cooking continues .
the couple , while writing the book , expressed that ms. ziegelman &apos;s mother learned a lot from her mother &apos;s eating habits - for example , she could never throw food at her .
&quot; food waste really scared him , &quot; mr. coe said .
ms. ziegelman talked about her old memories : &quot; it really made people sick . &quot;
there was a cream bun .
after collecting the plates at eisenberg , he and mr. coe made a sweetie they prepared at home : president roosevelt &apos;s dessert , which he ate at lunch .
ms. ziegelman said , &quot; it is called pruned prune , &quot; and added the most frequently used number to give a cool name to these modest tariffs .
there was no whipped cream , just prunes , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone hesitantly plunged to the point of finding a brown sticky .
surprisingly it was not too bad .
mr. coe took the second and third spoon .
as someone who might be saving , he said , &quot; a little chopped walnut piece would be good . &quot;
gilead will receive attorneys &apos; fees in the battle for hepatitis c with merck
according to the us district judge &apos;s decision , gilead sciences inc. has received the attorneys &apos; fees related to the hepatitis c patient trial conducted with drug maker merck &amp; co inc .
gilead was dismissed in june to pay $ 200 million in compensation for the violation of two merck patents on gilead &apos;s highly successful drugs sovaldi and harvoni , after us judge merck found he had been involved in a series of misrepresentations including false testimony and other unethical practices .
in thursday &apos;s session , us district judge beth labson freeman stated that gilead had the right to be compensated for the charges incurred during the defense of the case .
merck is trying to catch up with gilead , the market leader with a new generation of hepatitis c drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of liver disease .
the case dates back to 2013 when gilead and merck sue each other and claim ownership of the laboratory work for the sofosuvir , the active ingredient of gilead &apos;s medicines .

the clinton family earned $ 10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 percent federal tax
on friday , hillary clinton announced the 2015 tax bill , which shows that democrats earned $ 10.75 million for the year we passed , and that the current 34.2 percent is paying federal taxes .
in 2015 , the clinton family contributed $ 1 million to charitable organizations , most of them from the clinton foundation . former president bill clinton earned about $ 5.3 million in speech fees , and the former foreign minister announced that he earned $ 3 million for the book from simon &amp; schuster publishing house in the state department .
clinton &apos;s prospective friend senator from usa , tim kaine from virginia , published his 10-year tax declaration with his wife anne holton .
in 2015 , they paid federal taxes at a rate of 20.3 percent .
&quot; hillary clinton and tim kaine continue to set the standard for fiscal transparency , &quot; clinton campaigner jennifer palmieri said in a statement .
on the contrary , donald trump is hiding behind false prophecies about his promises to disclose tax statements he has made and is backing off .
although legislations are necessary , it is a fact that the us presidential candidates submit tax declarations to the public .
trump , a new york business man , and his lawyers stated that the reason for the rejection of the statements was an audit conducted by the revenue administration .
in connection with the statements of the democratic candidate , clinton campaign officer ian sams threw his tweet on &quot; you &apos;re on your own &quot; .
on thursday , trump &apos;s special case lawyer michael cohen said cnn would not allow trump to publish them until the inspections were completed .
the group , which criticized trump , including mitt romney , the presidential candidate of republicans in 2012 , and other republicans , said that the rejection itself has raised questions about its ownership , contributions to charities , business agreements and many other links , including those with russia .
clinton went on to do this on friday by publishing an online video showing that senior republicans were pressuring trump to explain the tax .
in an economy speech in michigan on thursday , he voiced this problem .
he said to the crowd , &quot; for decades , every presidential candidate has refused to do what he does , publish tax returns . &quot;
politico reported that trump paid almost no tax for two years in the 1990s , and on friday , the new york times business section columnist shared a statement that a number of tax advocates and accountants may still be doing so .
federal tax rates have become a major problem in presidential elections .
clinton offered a rule proposal that took the name of billionaire investor warren buffet , who would earn at least 30 percent of the tax on those who earn over $ 1 million a year .
president obama also supports this offer .
in the past week , at a clinton rally in omaha , nebraska , the berkshire hathaway group challenged buffett , who had been there , to come to trump and present his tax declaration .
buffet stated that he was also undergoing irs supervision and that he was &quot; afraid &quot; of voters , not trump &apos;s tax collection agency .
clinton issued tax declarations up to 2007 in his campaign .
currently , the clinton family in chappaqua , new york , has paid an average federal tax of approximately 32 percent between 2007 and 2014 , and the combined tax rate reaches approximately 40.5 percent .
the clinton family &apos;s declaration for the year 2015 shows that , unlike most americans , only about $ 100 of their income comes from wages .
the main investments are a low-cost index investment fund , and the clinton family declared that dividends and interest income were $ 109,000 .

powdered red pepper condoms , chestnut pins support the preservation of filler in tanzania
the environmentalists in tanzania use an unusual method to prevent the filler from entering the residential areas , throwing condoms full of powdered red pepper .
the method proved to be effective , and the honeyguide foundation and the us-based nature conservation association , which found this idea a few years ago , stepped in to introduce it , and in villages in northern tanzania , volunteers began to educate volunteers to use a nonviolent , four-step method of protecting their homes and their crops without damaging animals .
previously , most people were using spears to defend themselves .
on friday , world elephant day dedicated to the protection of animals .
damian bell , managing director of honeyguide , said in a statement , &quot; we have seen the attitudes of these communities changed since we developed the tool set , and now they have more confidence that they can keep them away from the dealings without damaging the fill . &quot;
the first two steps involve passing the torch and horn .
if this is not possible , the so-called &quot; red pepper cloud &quot; is being thrown away .
powdered red pepper mixed with soil , a chestnut phlox puts on the condoma , only the fuze is closed in such a way as to remain open .
when it is burned , the condom opens with an explosion sound and the red pepper is scattered into the air .
even a breath is enough to send the project in the opposite direction .
the last resort is to use a catapult that throws fireworks into the air , causing a loud , bright burst .
jewish filmmaker shoots hotel in berlin , abolishing israeli phone code on &quot; request &quot; of arabs - rt news
a jewish french filmmaker led to a sensation in the media after the kempinski bristol hotel in berlin could not list the phone code of israel and suggested that the employee suggested &quot; demands &quot; for arab customers .
claude lanzmann , author of the documentary on the genocide &quot; shoah &quot; , expressed anger at the kempinski bristol hotel in berlin with an open letter to the german publication faz .
lanzmann tried to find israel on the list of phone codes he had provided to the hotel shortly before his stay .
however , the country was not among the direct searchable states .
how can israel be eliminated and destroyed in berlin in 2016 , the new capital of germany ?
he wrote it , lanzmann .
instead , kempinski bristol offers the possibility to call israel through its call center .
the filmmaker reported the situation to the hotel reception to get an explanation .
lanzmann wrote that the answer he received was &quot; shocking him . &quot;
the secretary of the hotel stated that this measure was taken with &quot; kempinski-hotels management &apos;s deliberate decision &quot; .
the underlying reason for this movement was that the filmmaker became much more angry .
according to lanzmann , the employee said , &quot; most of our guests wanted the code of arab and israel to be deleted . &quot;
according to suddeutsche zeitung , israeli ambassador to germany yakov hadas-handelsman described this as &quot; a great shame . &quot;
this situation made us sick and very surprised .
it &apos;s really a shame .
it is a much bigger disaster if it happened in germany and in such a hotel chain .
you do not have to explain this .
we expect the hotel to get the necessary result , &quot; said the official .
the incident prompted a massive reaction in the online environment , where people described it as a scandal .
some accused the kempinski hotel of &quot; submitting &quot; to the alleged claims of arab customers .
in another post , &quot; embarrassment &quot; was mentioned , emphasizing that the hotel was located near a synagogue in kurfurstendamm .
according to der spiegel , the hotel quickly threw away the accusations by saying that this was the end of &quot; carelessness &quot; and &quot; apologizing &quot; from lanzmann .
suddeutsche zeitung stated that one of kempinski &apos;s representatives said that he had never had a direct order &quot; that israel should not be included in the quick search list &quot; .
and now they have added code .

this latest protest took place a few days after protesters stepped out on the streets to protest the resigned president dilma rousseff , who was removed from office by the senate of the country .
trade between russia and iran has risen to 71 % - rt business
according to russia &apos;s ambassador to iran , levan dzhagaryan , the trade surplus between moscow and tehran grew by 70.9 percent year-on-year , with sanctions being lifted .
the ambassador said that since the removal of international sanctions against iran , the interest of russian companies doing business in the country has increased dramatically .
while new companies are preparing to provide access to the market , russian companies maintain their existing ties with iran .
of course , the further increase of trade is one of the main priorities of our bilateral cooperation with iran , &quot; said dzhagaryan .
in the first five months of 2016 , the trade between russia and iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and reached 856 million dollars .
in particular , russia &apos;s exports to iran rose by 91.5 percent to reach $ 697 million .
russia &apos;s imports from iran rose by 16 percent to 158 million dollars .
this increase in trade was provided by consumables for machinery , floor tools and weapons , &quot; said the envoy .
at the same time , dzhagaryan expects a record number of iranian tourists to come to russia this year .
last year , russia &apos;s diplomatic representation in iran gave iranian citizens 35,000 visas , most of them for travel .
moreover , for the first time , iran was among the top 20 countries in terms of tourists visiting russia .
we can say that iranian tourists visiting russia last year will be breaking records , &quot; he said .
at the same time , relatively few russians visit iran , which is something the embassy hopes to change .
&quot; i personally recommend visiting the cities of isfahan , shiraz and yazd , where the monuments of the ancient persian civilization are kept in good condition , &quot; he said .

preference 5 to 10 years
how much advantage will house interest rate reductions bring home ?
100 thousand pounds a 10-year loan to a person who uses the term , interest 30 thousand pounds discount will provide a discount .
the vast majority of those who use housing loans choose a 5-10 year deferred payment plan .
in the coming days , interest rates are expected to decline further .
interest rate cuts will also affect sales positively .
in 2015 , house sales increased by 10.6 percent compared to the previous year , reaching 1 million 289 thousand .
this year sales are expected to exceed 1.5 million with a discount on interest .
gyoder president aziz torun : must be reduced to 9 percent per annum

it &apos;s always the same thing .
interest is falling , house prices are rising .

&quot; looks like it happened again , &quot; he says .
he talks about his feelings because he is interested in individual loans .
says that contractors entering the 0.70 interest rate campaign organized by emlak konut increased prices in many housing projects .
i looked to see if there was any truth .
there &apos;s a shortage , no more cinsten ...
meanwhile , a week after the fetullah terrorist organization &apos;s coup attempt on july 15 , a contractor who participated in the construction summit organized by our newspaper came to our homes .
the patron of a great company ...
when i heard the words of the contractor that i will not give the name , &quot; actually , i have to raise prices 10 percent , &quot; i said , &quot; will you do coup opportunities ? &quot;
following the coup attempt , the real estate housing initiative initiated a major sales campaign with 0.70 interest and 120 months of maturity .
i admit , he put his hand under the stone before the banks , the risk took .
but if we do not cut the pace of turkey , we are moving in the spirit of unity and togetherness .
1-month campaign also supported the banks by lowering interest rates .
then nobody raise the opportunity .

president tayyip erdogan warned the banks yesterday : &quot; i will say that when interest rates fall and credit facilities are expanded , a new era will be opened in front of both our country and investors as well as our banks . &quot;
i would like to insist on giving credit in this period of our country , i would like to announce that the banks that recall the loans with their unfashionable terms have determined their own purity .

over 500 russian tourists are expected
ali kızıldağ , president of professional hotel management association ( poyd ) , stated that turkey-russia relations entered into a positive route before the 15 july coup attempt at the expo 2016 antalya exhibition area and that scheduled flights to russia from antalya to antalya started and there was a certain revival in tourism .
president kızıldağ expressed the excitement of the tourism industry as well as the sectors that trade between the two countries . &quot; i look forward to seeing very positive developments in terms of all sectors of tourism and textile products , both in tourism and in the food industry , &quot; said president recep tayyip erdogan and russian president vladimir putin .
turkey and russia are very close to each other , we have traditional relations based on years .
&quot; i think we can close the distances as quickly as we can , and we can head for the targets , &quot; he said .
without the coup attempt , the number of russian tourists coming to turkey estimated that they would exceed 1 million kızıldağ , said :
but when we say high season we lost a month , so the target is getting smaller .
i still think that if we start charter flights , we will exceed 500 thousand .
it may also be the end of october or even the middle of november .
in such a case , additional flights can be placed towards the beginning of the year .
i guess this positive atmosphere will be well appreciated by the russian people .
they also have a longing for turkey .
i hope that this momentum will probably force 700 thousand .
speaking of hope for the 2017 russian market , kızıldağ said that if the russian economy is recovered as well as the relations between the two countries , the number of russian tourists could rise again to over 3 million next year .
poyd president kızıldağ stated that domestic reservations were started in the slightest by removing the ban on the permission of the public personnel . &quot; there are revolutions in canceled reservations , new reservations have begun to be taken . &quot;
&quot; we have a hopeful hope for the feast of sacrifice , &quot; he said .
kizildag said that the removal of the ban on tour ticket sales to travel agencies by iran after the coup attempt was a very positive development , saying , &quot; it would be great if we could bring 100-200 thousand people in iran in 1.2-2 months . &quot;
is the current loan , the renewal ?
first of all , learn how the new interest rate conditions affect your credit by discussing with the bank you borrowed .
calculate from your bank the cost of using a new loan at a lower interest rate along with the early closing rate of the loan ( up to 1.5-2 % of the usual rate ) .
if you include all the costs , you can still apply for the advantageous low interest loan .
do not breathe the aslan !

however , until this time the fugitive did not get caught and the arrest for the four defendants decided to conduct illegal proceedings .
adana 2 high criminal court ruled that all property should be seized by fetullah gulen , Ömer ekinci , kemal elibal and cemal soncu in accordance with article 278 / 1 of the criminal procedure code ( cmk ) , which is in the foreign country and is in a foreign country and thus illegally reaching to it .
with this decision of the court , the immovables , land-sea and air transportation vehicles , all kinds of rights and receivables , negotiable documents , company shares with partner , rental car cases and bank accounts belonging to fugitive defendants were frozen .
hüseyin gülerce : gülen &apos;s demise depends on the collapse of 3 feet
hüseyin gülerce , who interprets fetÖ &apos;s coup attempt , was in striking statements .
hüseyin gülerce &apos;s line-ups are as follows :
as i have in mind that they will attempt to darbeye , this sentence has written in the last 5-6 months in my writings , &quot; they may attempt , but they can not do it in command chain . &quot;
i did not know two things , the first one being widespread and deep in this circle , such as the 8-year commander of the general command of the gendarmerie and the lieutenant of the president of the republic of turkey .
mr president the president is the most struggling person , who can be careful how he chooses his loyalists , but the most important feature of them is the unseen secrecy .
very two-faced .
one of the most important proofs of the phrase &quot; this is not the job that a retired preacher like feto can do &quot; is such a deep compass .
he is definitely getting support from the cia .
cia , this guy is too early handed .
mahmut Övür says in 2014 that in 1971 fuat doğu and fetullah gulen addressed vehbi koç &apos;s house .
he says that the people who are most interested in that period are the closest to the relationship between the mit and the cia .
the us has paid the salaries of our armed forces personnel , and after he did not remember them , a man emerged like this .
when are we learning this , in 2014 ?
after this article of mr. mahmut bey , there was no explanation to deny it .
for example , adil orphan was caught up , was not he ?
i wonder who this is .
adam went to pennsylvania twice in the last 25 days before the coup d &apos;etat , and returned two days ago .
adil orphan went abroad 109 times since 2002 .
when you put all these together , you need to investigate , since now that all of the fugitives have gone to fetullah gülen usa in march 1999 , they have gone to the us with a pretext .
it will be seen that they went to pennsylvania for some reason .
but the actual contacts with the cia can be determined here , especially from the people who need to be raised within the safety of many people sent to the us with safety .
there are wikileaks documents , establishes an association that is smiling and this association is making joint meetings with the cia .
15 years before that , the cia and the connections were made to show officially .
fuat avni said i was an intelligence pool in pennsylvania 2 years ago .
the man working at the prime ministry is working for fuat avni .
but the bad news is that the information fell to pennsylvania as well as to the cia .
the demolition of gulen depends on the collapse of the three legs , one is the base , the other is the friendly ring , there are those who are deeply hypnotized , they say that even this coup attempt is still erdogan &apos;s film .
i &apos;m three feet , a base support .
theft of the questions , theft , the right to defeat the employer , this base support is very sarcılı .
the other two are political support , international support .
international support still exists .
the only thing that will break political support is documenting that the tapes of the baikal and mhp administrators were pulled by the pto .
after july 15th , &quot; kılıçdaroğlu &quot; also used &quot; fetÖ &quot; , everyone &apos;s eyes opened .
gülen is such a trickster that he says , &quot; i do not do it . &quot;
my side says , &quot; yehu hussein bey , these girls see very different dreams , they send me , i forbid now , because it is not right to work with dreams &quot; .
a voice recording fell , the person speaking in that voice recording barbaros kocakurt : my friends dreamed of friends , double our prophet &apos;s tweets .
1 policeman was killed in nusaybin
according to the information received , the armored vehicle where police officers patrolling the salahaddin eyyubi neighborhood were fired with long-barreled weapons by terrorists .
a police officer was wounded when a police officer was killed .
two terrorists were neutralized in the clash over the police response .

operation in the district is continuing .
the darbacies were playing tv broadcasts were not interrupted
private televisions , which had a significant share in the prevention of the coup attempt on july 15 , continued to broadcast thanks to a technical staff who heroically resisted the coup plotters in türksat .
here is the heroine asak akkaya ...
akkaya stated that they had entered the resistance psychology with the instruction to interrupt the publication during the reading of the declaration in trt . &quot; i have seen everything by thinking that my friends who were opened from helicopter were martyrs . &quot;
they wanted to stop the weapons and cut off the broadcasts .
i just turned off local tvs .
then i told them that we should not go to the dish antennas and let them move away from the building .
i spent about 20 minutes in the section where the antennas are located .
&quot; here again cut some cables , but i did not touch the broadcasts , &quot; he said .
when the darbecans failed to interrupt the broadcast on türksat , they brought the experts of the milky way tv .
these terrorists were caught by the police three minutes before the scene .
after the couriers returned to their homes , about one hour later , they realized that the tv broadcasts were continuing by telephone , and that at that moment came to the point of death , akkaya said :
i took the evening shift that night at 8 o &apos;clock .
that &apos;s right .
my friend was on duty for the e-government and the electrical system .
we met at 21.00 to drink tea and we made low flights while passing helicopters .
in the vicinity of the helicopter there were a few other aircraft still quietly flying from below .
we saw his lights .
it was probably unmanned aerial vehicles that could get an image .
they were flying in front of the helicopters .
i &apos;ve been here for about 11 years , i &apos;ve been looking for it for the first time i &apos;ve seen so close .
then a movement began .
as we watched the news , we learned that the bridge was closed .
at that time , our general manager gave instructions to the non-mates in security to come to the building .
we learned that all of the broadcasts in trt were packed when we were going to order to get information .
trt broadcasts were cut for 5 minutes .
i called the trt main command but could not reach it .
our control station told us that trt broadcasts came back and that the papers had started to be read .
our deputy chief executive halil yesilcimen requested the urgent interruption of trt broadcasts by order of general manager .
since trt broadcast a wide range of 3 channels , we started to work on the transmission .
we have just heard that prime minister binali yıldırım said &apos; there is an upsurge &apos; .
our director &apos; trt &apos; is a definite &apos; command puts us into resistance psychology .
the trt was cut , after a while we heard a helicopter .
when we went out , the helicopter landed in order to shoot everywhere , everyone scattered aside .
we &apos;ve been hiding in a building on the back .
we were 12 people in total .
when we were back , the soldiers descending from the helicopter entered .
soldiers caught a few of our friends .
we came out to leave them alone .
at that moment i saw that they had caught our assistant general manager and kneeled .
the soldiers were talking among themselves .
&quot; one of them is one of them , &quot; said one of them .
then they all sat inside .
the commanders began to yell , &apos; who will be responsible for this place , i will not ask again . &apos; 
when we heard the speeches of &apos; i am spitting one &apos; , we thought : we do not know about the country but an order came to us , saying &apos; trt is definite &apos; .
so there is a resistance .
at that moment i felt that i had given up on my own .
i said &apos; me . &apos; 
at that moment i stood on the foot without knowing what to do .
the only thing i thought at that moment was that friends from the helicopter had opened fire .
i thought 10 to 15 friends were martyrs in nizami and i thought that they would kill us in the end .
the head of the commander &apos; trt except all the broadcasts will be cut , &apos; he said .
we have a system part where we monitor when local channels go to satellite .
80 of the 200 local channels are being released from the room .
do not forget this room .
there were no national broadcasts between them .
if i cut them down and told them all was cut off , at least until that time , support comes out and help comes out .
or i said go where it went .
we eventually accepted that we could not get out of there .
i said , &apos; i &apos;ll cut it off . &apos; 
cut the antenna output of one of the local channel packets .
cut the power button to the monitors where we can watch the national channels .
so there is no signal on all screens .
i told her i had to go to the antennas to be completely cut .
the two commanders sent me to the antenna .
i opened the antenna room , one of the soldiers said &apos; stop there &apos; .
the gun held my head .
&apos;you will cut all but trt , there will not be any , i will shoot one of you in the end , this is you , &apos; he said .
as i passed by now , i easily said , &apos; you will see it going , it will be frozen &apos; , i said nothing else .
i entered the station , drove around and cut out local broadcasts .
we went to the other antenna .
at that time , there was no system corresponding to around 20 national channels .
there were about 20 monitors wasted in local channels .
my lord helped us so much that , while he was responding , he did not have difficulty and tied their prerogatives .
they believe in the answers we give .
they are superior .
this has relieved us .
after leaving antenden , he asked for the location of the traction .
&quot; i do not know , i &apos;m a tv broadcaster , &quot; i said , &quot; are there any electrician among you ? &quot;
&apos;i will not be an electrician in the evening afterwards , if there is a fault , the crew will come . &apos; 
actually , there was an electrician at the time .
i have not stopped cyprus publications .
i was thinking of not cutting them to distract the soldiers .
they were a little relieved because they thought the publications were cut off .
they did not mind looking at the publications .
now the band is on standby .
about an hour later they opened the tv in the waiting room and saw the news broadcast .
he came in , soldier .
&apos;the news has not been broadcast to the commissioner , &apos; he said .
we came to the eye with the commander .
he said , &apos; get up . &apos; 
i &apos;m gone .
he and a soldier said &apos; there are still publications going on . &apos; 
&apos;there are channels broadcasting in cyprus , &apos; he said .
&quot; they are broadcasting on cyprus , we can not do anything to them , &quot; i said .
&quot; then after we had written with one of them , we all walked up to the foot , &quot; he said .
darbeciler escaped turksat with a minibus .
i saw from the photographs that the soldier who brought me the toilet and water was executed in the chair of that van .
they shot three times and shot them from their foreheads and cheeks .
my friends confirmed it was the same soldier .
they were addressing that soldier &apos; son &apos; .
he was probably a soldier .
they may have executed to get rid of him .
according to asım akkaya &apos;s words , the first police officer came to turksat from gölbaşı .
when the police officers learned that the helicopters were around , they went to the county and went to receive ammunition .
he returned in 40 minutes .
turksat did not see anyone outside the police when the police came .
akkaya said that only 3-4 minutes after the policemen arrived at the so-called specialists sent from the milky way tv . &quot; akkaya said , &quot; we called the police teams from inside , turksat staff , we have to enter urgently . &quot;
&quot; police identity hurriedly surprised four of the four suddenly wrapped around their phones and they were caught inside , &quot; he said .

he saw the pumpkin in ergenekon , feto killed
the ankara chief public prosecutor investigates the role of fetÖ in the mysterious death of behçet oktay , the president of the special operations department whose file &quot; suicide &quot; was closed in 2009 .
ramazan akyürek , the head of the former police intelligence department , who remained in the same lodgings with oktay and listened to oktay 6 days before his death as a suspect in the hizbullah terrorist organization , is a suspect in the investigation .
it is claimed that some of the ammunition seized under ergenekon investigation was stolen and buried by the police officer in the special operations department and that it was killed because it was detected by oktay .
the death of behçet oktay , the head of the special operations unit , which was shot in ankara on 25 february 2009 , was called &quot; suicide &quot; .
however , there were many questions .
after 2 years as a result of the legal struggle of the family and family lawyers and the evidence they showed , this time the murder investigation was opened .
the pistol , which was said to have shot oktay himself who was left-handed , was in the right hand .
in addition , fractures in the ribs and scars in the body were detected .
the case related to the murder investigation was opened in may of 2012 .
in the murder case , only halil kesici , who was present at the time of his death and had gunshot in his hand , was tried .
the cutter was acquitted at the end of the trial .
nurhan Önder , who was in prison for another crime and sent a letter to the prosecutor &apos;s office saying that he was involved in the death of oktay , was sentenced to six months &apos; imprisonment for &quot; committing crimes and misleading the judicial authorities &quot; .
it is responsible
in the meantime , while prosecutor huseyin yalcin , who is called &quot; suicide &quot; , retired , he was promoted to mustafa düzgün court of cassation , who conducted the murder investigation .
the oktay family wants these prosecutors to investigate the autopsy prosecutor nihat yildirim .
behçet oktay &apos;s sister Şule oktay and his brother nezih oktay and family lawyers were in many demands during the trial .
halil kesici &apos;nin oktay &apos;ın specially trained to say that it is impossible to kill the family alone , the investigation wanted to expand .
the family , who said that the incident was overruled , asked prosecutors hüseyin yalçın and mustafa düzgün and behçet oktay to file and prosecute security officers who wanted to close the file as suicide .
it turned out that all requests were rejected by the family , while oktay was resting with his fake name &quot; abdurrahman doğru &quot; as a member of the hizbullah terrorist organization 6 days before his death .
ramazan akyürek , the head of the department of police intelligence , was also identified as the one who had to listen .
upon this development , the ankara public prosecutor &apos;s office , which reconsidered the file of behçet oktay , began to examine the finger of fetullahçı terrorist organization ( feto ) in the cinema .
the trial against the illegal hearing of oktay will begin on september 19th at the ankara heavy penal court .
there are natural futures behind
the oktay family , seen by sabah , is hopeful from the current investigation being conducted .
family members say that during the pre-emptive investigation and trial they had covered up the feto finger on the murder .
sister oktay sister , &quot; this murder actually showed the show . &quot;
we can not perceive it .
before my brother was murdered , he said , &quot; they will eat me . &quot;
i said &apos; kim &apos; .
then he pointed to fetÖ .
i thought it would be taken out of duty .
i never brought death to mind .
behind this is of course feto .
&quot; at that time management was in their possession , &quot; he said .

protecting the traitor pkk
turkey , which has been struggling to end pkk terror for over 40 years , has begun to face the day why turkey can not destroy its leaders in this struggle .
the pkk militants , who have penetrated the critical institutions of turkey , have worked to link the arm of turkey to the four sides .
at this point , serious doubts and evidences about the fact that hrant dink murder , uludere incident , the fall of the russian plane were behind the critical events , have begun to appear .
very horn
it turned out that the record of tfg brigadier general gökhan Şahin sönmezateş , who led the operation and the assassination of president tayyip erdoğan &apos;s hotel in marmaris during the coup attempt of july 15 , appeared to be quite fluffy .
it was previously determined that sönmezateş informed the terrorists that the air operations to be carried out against the pkk were taking off .
investigations made by the intelligence units also revealed that the registry of gökhan sönmezateş is fluffy .
terrorists guard
in addition to leakage of intelligence into the pkk , turkish war planes have not fully hit the targets set in the agenda .
it was claimed that the intelligence given by mİt in the footsteps of kandil regarding the leader of the terrorist organization pkk was prevented from being hit by gökhan sönmezateş .
with the change of the coordinates , it was determined that the war planes that flew to destroy the pkk &apos;s leader cadres , hit the places on the sides of the targets , and so were the terrorist leaders .
in the intelligence investigation , it turned out that sönmezateş played a key role both in deflecting the targets and in escaping from pkk terrorists without fleeing the f-16s .

pehlivanoglu : turkes &quot; poisoned by the feto
başsemis tahsin pehlivanoglu retired from the protection of alparslan türkeş , the founder and first general president of the mhp , claiming that turkes was killed by poisoning and that one of the family members made it in cooperation with the feto .
pehlivanoglu , who was with turkes every time from 1977 until his death in 1997 , said , &quot; i did not tell anyone until today , but i had to talk after seeing muhsin yazicioglu was watching the view of the soldier from the helicopter and that the same soldier was in the dutymen to kill our president .
here is what the protection of turkes says :
in 1997 we went to germany .
we had a check-up at the head office 3 days before we arrived .
fikret , a 33-year-old burdur doctor who checks up , says , &quot; you look like a teenager . &quot;
&quot; you have nothing , &quot; he said .
this doctor died 1 month after the heart attack .
we returned to ankara on april 3rd .
my head went to amasya .
on the way back , they called me and went to a nickname in ankara hilton .
after leaving the nişandan turkars driver alparslan &quot; open the rear window &quot; he says .
he would not open glass in his life .
there is a sound when you open the window .
at the Çankaya medical center first , heart massage , electrostructures , but finished .
we took him to the bayındır medical center together , but he was in business .
i think someone in the family poisoned amasya .

the sky will be the scene of meteor shower
professor hasan esenoglu , associate professor of tubitak national observatory and istanbul university astronomy and space sciences department , told aa correspondent that perseid will reach the highest level of the night connecting friday , august 12 , to saturday , august 13th .
with the effect of sun rays and gravity , thousands of pieces were separated from the comet named &quot; swift - tuttle &quot; , indicating that perseid skystone rain was formed , and that this situation would turn into a natural visual feast .
esenoglu stated that the perseid sky stone was first discovered in 1862 and that it has begun to be seen again in the world since the 1990s .
perseid sky rock rain can be watched in july and august , esenoglu expressed , &quot; we are watching a visual feast like this , we should not be interested . &quot;
after all , this is a natural visual feast .
&quot; it will contribute to the betterment of the universe , &quot; he said .
it will be red when it is cold , white when it is warm
esenoglu pointed out that some of the fragments that fall during the rainfall will fall on the earth in the size of lentils , he continued as follows :
perseid temperatures can be up to 2 thousand cents .
due to warming and rubbing in the atmosphere , perseids produce red in the cold and white in the natural environment .
it can be informed by writing how many celestial rocks are seen from the website of the international meteorological organization .
this data is valuable because it is collected from all over the world .
may be watched all night

esenoglu said that more than 100 heavenly rock springs came to the water every year . after the perseid sky rock rain , geminid sky stone rain on 4-17 december was a natural event worth watching .
less educated , former footballer erdogan
this equilibrium was a winning alliance of populist islamists led by less-educated former footballer recep tayyip erdogan and a highly educated follower who founded more schools , dozens of universities and educational institutes than fetullah gulen , a large religious entrepreneur , from texas to tashkent .
the translation above is a translation of a sentence that came out in the foreign policy last week .
erdogan , who is a university graduate , is a poorly educated and old football player , and gülen , who is a primary school graduate , is widely described as a broad entrepreneur , and these and similar articles , which are clearly praised by gulen ministers , frequently appear in the western press .
after that , on the other hand they are trying to explain the proclamations starting with &quot; because of erdogan ... &quot; in their article &quot; why is america and / or western antagonism rising in turkey ? &quot; .
it is possible to imagine that the analysts who see turkey &apos;s anti-westernism as a phenomenon that emerged during erdogan &apos;s era are from turkey &apos;s history .
in fact , if we look at the statistics , the first decade of the erdogan era can be read as a period in which the anti-westernism in turkey declines or remains in the middle .
this was in good agreement with the european union and the united states in a synchronized manner over the past decade .
there are many reasons such as erdogan &apos;s &quot; one-minute &quot; criticism of israel , the eu &apos;s lack of a clear policy on the eu &apos;s assassination of syria &apos;s regime and the reduction of the unity with the support of us and baghdad administration as well as the support of us government and baghdad administration as well as mosul and other similar reasons such as schulz &apos;s unconstitutionality .
let &apos;s say that we have forgotten that no support from our so-called eu countries and the united states until the failure of the coup d &apos;état proved unsuccessful , that we were waiting for the &apos; first peacefulness and stability in turkey &apos; to be built in kerry &apos;s first speech , and that no emphasis was given to democracy and the elected ruler .
how would it be forgotten that no president from any western country who was &apos; ally &apos; to turkey even though a month has passed since the coup attempt in which 247 people who resisted tanks for democracy were killed , though many leaders from around the world , including turkey , participated in the protest march because 11 charlie hebdo workers were killed in paris .
what do we say to the refugees issue that the president or high-level representatives , who come several times a year , send low-level representatives ?
how will we evaluate all the eu and us ambassadors for a past visit and not visit a solidarity visit with the bombed turkish grand national assembly because the hurriyet newspaper &apos;s window is broken ?
if it is recalled that in the first two weeks of the coup in egypt , the eu has sent a senior representative to shake hands with the coup leader sisi and that kerry &apos;s &quot; post democracy is being rebuilt &quot; in the aftermath of the coup , it is recalled that the western countries that are concerned about turkey &apos;s democracy at all times are insincere in turkey .
even if gülen is allowed to live freely in the us , which 95 % of the people regard as the responsibility of the darben , it is enough to get the turkish people out of the moment .
if the background i have mentioned above is added to this , i think it is clear that the rising western / american opposition is a situation that can not be explained only with erdogan .
moreover , erdogan did not even say that he thought the us influence was in the narrow streets ...
so the chest is never a detail
traveling minds who humiliate their own people as small , &quot; policemen &quot; , who do not consider themselves as ignorant &quot; excrement rubbish &quot; , can they play the same after 15th of july ?
after seeing how these people got to the state and democracy , would they have searched for the answer &quot; where are we wrong &quot; ?
but there are so many questions that should be answered ?
being traitors officers who have served at various levels until now and are given the right to use their state &apos;s weapons , have agreed to enter the status of &quot; traitor &quot; and seek refuge from foreign states .
we need to see how we live in an environment of mental distortion and that obsessions toward the person lead people to behaviors that are perverted .
irrigated brains as for the coup attempt ...
was there a point of view for those who participated in this action , beyond comparing turkey &apos;s cities to those of syria ?
why is an officer bombing his country &apos;s parliament ?
from the brains that were watered with the cries of fetÖ , we should not have fallen into a misconception as to expect reasonable behaviors .
other responsibilities but we know that not only is the fellows responsible for everything .
the staff who presented politics as a profession of hatred and hatred have made the necessary contributions to the tragedies experienced .
the aymazlar , who presented themselves as &quot; aydın &quot; , also believed that all kinds of irregular behavior and even rudeness were natural .
when we give weapons to the hands of those who hate their own people , we have even seen how they open fire to the people .
the way of democracy , the way we know
i say something very simple : on the evening of july 15th , turkish soldiers of the peoples republic of turkiye gave 250 martyrs to haramilere , sergerdeleye and set up democracy to save .
but behind july 15 , there are three periods : 1992-2002 ;
there are three changes made in these three periods : economic , social , political .
two major cases of social change have been created : immigration from the countryside to the metropolis , and the centering of these immigrants after being held around the cities for a very long time .
on wednesday , i mentioned that this is via the metro .
i also stressed that it is the most important element of social change , not to mention the metro .
the second major change in the same direction is the bridges and roads .
the contribution of the road and the bridge to modernization is more easily understood .
road income , economic and social structure changes .
in our case , however , it has changed the political structure .
i have been spotting this historic istanbul with the bridges thrown over the bosporus .
demirel has built the bosphorus bridge .
this was the peak of the post-1950 peasant movement in the 1960s .
ozal continued with the second bridge we changed as the 15th of july martyrs bridge , not to proceed in the same direction .
even their pathways show the relationship established between the environment and the center .
it is also a sign of how social change is being pursued .
the aim of demirel and Özal was to dissolve large masses in the center .
it was to adopt the center &apos;s ideology to them .
ak party did not make the third bridge for many years .
because migration was driving at full speed .
the incoming people were placed in satellite towns .
a closed system was established in those regions .
local governments of the ak party gave people more work , social status , they voted for the ak party .
thus , the masses wanted not to be centralized but to acquire political consciousness in the environment and to come to the center as &apos; after themselves &apos; .
this formation was related to the ongoing headscarf debate ( 1992-2002 ) before the ak party .
these debates accepted the obligation of conservative , mutual , and provincial people to stay side by side , not central integration .
the ak party acted with the method that i mentioned after 2002 to politicize , politicize and mature .
after that , note now , the democratic struggle on july 15th is concurrent with the construction of the 3rd bridge .
so history and sociology overlap .
i add one more dimension to this : the ak party &apos;s mentioned movements are not limited to istanbul bridges .
something more interesting is happening : the ak party now integrates the surrounding cities with the central cities .
this is provided through two bridges .
one , osmangazi bridge .
two , bridge to canakkale 1915 .
add routes to it .
turkey will now travel from thrace to izmir from another route .
do you know what this means , İzmir will be a completely different city from now on .
let &apos;s say , the ak party &apos; from inside &apos; can not receive izmir &apos; from the outside &apos; will now .
now bursa , now Çanakkale , now thracian cities will be transformed into other human and social geography .
that &apos;s it !
the martyrs of july 15 are the stars of this great adventure .

aziz yildirim complained to gülen ...
there are new developments in the handicraft operation for fenerbahçe .
journalist hüseyin gülerce , who participated in a program published on cnn türk and explained that this operation was done by fetÖ , said : &quot; a name from sports world raised the words about aziz yildirim himself to fethullah gulen . &quot;
&quot; lightning one day on the plane this person &apos; what you &apos;re doing next to fethullah gulen fethullah , &quot; he said .
fethullah gulen also put on aziz yildirim when this person conveyed these words to gulen .
why did he wear aziz yildirim ?
the head of the club , which is the most supporter of turkey , thinks that this mentality can harm him .
he used the phrase &quot; to quash aziz yildirim &apos;s quiz question . &quot;
a statement following these words came from faik işık , one of the major lawyers of the Şike trial .
işık habertürk &apos;ta published in the program of opposing opinion and aziz yildirim fethullah gülen fethullah gülen &apos; s ringleader explained the person who complained .
here are the words of faik işık :
aziz yildirim says something about İhsan kalkavan about fethullah gülen .
it comes from azerbaijan , on a private plane .
aziz is a humorous man , and he sings with skepticism when criticizing one .
those sinking cues maybe a little bleeding .
some of them may react .
these sentences are grown one time .
towels , himmetler , it is not such tolerable acceptance that so many of your businessmen go to hajj and umre .
they say what they are doing , they criticize it very seriously .
of course this is not the only problem .
in the meantime , there is also a football team .
direct connections of some football players and managers from galatasaray club and hakan Şükür ...
muharrem usta : the game of chic is different
trabzonspor president muharrem usta extended the friendship hand to fenerbahçe .
he said that turkey &apos;s case is the subject of all the clubs . &quot; we are on this country with 79 million . &quot;
we must show a steady attitude .
if there is a problem with fenerbahçe &apos;s feto , if an injustice is done , i will stand behind fenerbahçe .
&quot; however , the match-fixing issue between trabzonspor and fenerbahce is different , &quot; he said .
sacrifice prices announced
karabulut , said : &quot; as the union of the living sacrifice price of 18 pounds per kilogram we have determined . &quot;
&quot; we have 17 kilograms of live weight in the heifer price and 15 kilograms of live kilograms in the second class . &quot;
karabulut pointed out that the animals that were not to be sacrificed last year were also sold , and he explained what the citizens should be careful of when taking the sacrifice :
particular attention should be paid to earlobes in animals .
it is also very important that the animal is healthy .
for this , our citizens can control the vaccination of the animal &apos;s passport while receiving the victim .
from the outside it must be that the victim is alive and alive , with the feather on it .
there should be no signs of saliva or slime on your face .
we have seen animals that have not been sacrificed in the past have also been sold and sold .
a sacrificial animal needs to be 2 years old .
we can understand this by looking at the animal &apos;s teeth .
a 2-year-old animal had a tooth called &apos; cover &apos; .
but those smaller than the age of the teeth did not come out .
as an image the animal may be large , but the lid may not have been removed .
it is immediately noticed that the cover teeth are already larger than others .

robert is a very striking expression about feto from amsterdam !
robert amsterdam , the lawyer of the amsterdam &amp; partners law firm , which legally investigated the international illegal activities of the fetullah &apos;i terrorist organization ( feto ) , received an article from the us magazine forbes to share information on how fetÖ is organized .
it is clear that fethullah gülen , who is the leader of the fethullah gulen , managed the organization from pennsylvania &apos;s mansion , and that gülen &apos;s &quot; how to operate the 150 charter schools in the us &quot; is clearly visible when the organization has developed advanced organizational skills underground .
amsterdam stressed that what they have found so far is &quot; shocking &quot; , saying that seven months ago turkey was tasked with researching gulen-related companies and schools .
in his article on amsterdam ,
according to the information given to us by the İbşacılar , the gülen organization has a strict hierarchy in which the instructions are transmitted .
these instructions are usually transmitted at face-to-face meetings with gülen and poconos .
there is a management group of seven people on the hill ( consultative group ) .
this group transfers the instructions to the advisory committee .
the instructions go from here to regional imams , country imams , regional imams in the country , provincial imams , regional imams in illusions , neighborhood imams , imams of student houses ( light houses ) and students .
business people , bureaucrats and officers work at different levels according to their position and support within the organization .
amsterdam , which says that it has 55,000 business locations worldwide and has the largest contractual school network in the us , says that millions of dollars are paid to these schools each year from the taxes paid by american taxpayers .
amsterdam wrote that most of these funds were channeled among the members of the organization and transferred to &quot; selected &quot; subcontracting companies .
amsterdam explained this functioning with the following examples :
magnolia schools in california have been arrested for giving $ 700,000 in annual service contracts to the company that is linked to gulen and has the same office .
amsterdam , for example , showed the dove science academy in oklahoma .
amsterdam also noted that this school paid an additional $ 3.1 million to the property owner , and that the inspections had found that the administrations of the school and the property-owned company consisted of the same people associated with gulen .
noting that similar conditions exist in the 46-branch harmony schools , which hold the largest location in the gulen network , amsterdam said that smaller firms with affiliated to the feto paid money with items such as software licenses and curriculum purchases .
&quot; these examples show that about $ 28 million of american taxpayers have been abused , &quot; amsterdam said , highlighting the richness of each other in the feto .
&quot; moreover , this is the visible part of what we have found so far . &quot;
noting that nothing has been done to prevent such incidents until now , amsterdam reminded me that the situation in the last hour has worsened , and that the texas education office has started to investigate irregularities on all of this .
amsterdam stressed that schools seem to operate normally , and that many employees have no information about what kind of corruption they are .
&quot; but in fact these schools are working like snow machines for gulen . &quot;
&quot; gulen then used the huge amount of money for political donations to hide his illegal activities &quot; .
according to an expression by an old american teacher who worked in these schools , &quot; some of the staff at gulen schools are holding separate meetings , and they are telling a certain part of their wages . &quot; &quot; the gulen members of the turkish armed forces are believed to work in a similar way . &quot;
impulse provocations strengthened their position over the years .
&quot; but apparently the army was working normally , and parallel power was gathering power behind the scenes , &quot; he wrote .
amsterdam ended the article as follows :
policy makers in the us have questions of interest in the events of july 15-16 and later , and that is something to be expected .
however , while addressing the two allied positions at diplomatic level , it is necessary for individual state authorities to wake up in a series of violations of us law in gülen &apos;s operations .

attention to this habit of children
prof. bilgin giray , the dentist &apos;s professor , said that children are relieved with this reflex by making it a necessity because they can not chew in their early ages .
dr. giray , who listed the reasons for the appearance of finger sucking habits in children , &quot; finger sucking , from birth to a child aged 3-4 is seen . &quot;
most babies suck their thumbs .
a child sucking her finger to satisfy her need for sucking in her baby . after 1-1.5 years of age the mother &apos;s breast sucks her finger to make her longing and relax .
&quot; he &apos;s bored and self-distracted , when he &apos;s sleepy , when he &apos;s nervous and when he &apos;s leaving his mother , he can suck his finger . &quot;
dr. bilgin giray emphasized that the inferiority of the mother-child relationship and the lack of sense of confidence in the child lay in the foundation of the finger-sucking behaviors observed at advanced ages and explained the effects of this behavior on dental health with the following words :
finger sucking behavior has an adverse effect on the shape of the child &apos;s tooth structure .
as a result of the pressures generated during suction , the upper teeth are pushed forward , while the lower teeth are pushed back .
this leads to the positioning of the lower jaw backwards , destroying the balance of the palate and tooth structure .
its physiological reflections are in the form of speech impairment and closure appearing aesthetically bad .
&quot; we can protect our children from the problems of closing and joints before the development of the jaws is complete , &quot; said dr. giray , who noted that a much more complicated treatment process could be experienced during the period of 6-7 years when permanent teeth start appearing if there is no early solution .
&quot; for this reason , children &apos;s eye and hearing control , such as the mouth structure should be kept under control , &quot; he concluded his words .
new breathing in close-up vision treatment : trifocal lenses
patients naturally do not want to use glasses after cataract treatment .
multifocal lenses have already been used for many years to solve this problem in our patients .
with the trifocal lenses being used recently , the success of the treatment in this area has taken a step further .
the difference of triphocal lenses from other lenses is not only the distant or near distance , but also the ability to provide a clear view at distances defined as intermediate distances .
treatment of distant , near or intermediate distance visual disturbances
interval distance in visual disturbances represents a point that we use very often in our daily lives .
examples are portable computers with dash panels , laptops we hold in our lap , or distance we define as arm lengths of 60-70 cm .
thanks to the correction of the intermediate distances of the triphocal lenses , our patients do not need to wear eyeglasses any closer or far apart .
another advantage offered by the triphocal lens is that it also reduces nighttime complaints .
prof. volkan hürmeriç , an ophthalmologist , said : &quot; there is no difference in the treatment of trifocal lens used for every distance vision treatment from normal cataract treatment . &quot;
our patients who are treated with triphocal therapy can easily recover their eyesight by a 7 to 10 minute procedure .
and the next day our patients may return to their normal lives .
it is an opera - tion especially for those who use cars , use computers , enjoy reading , and have a more active life .
you can also consult an eye disease specialist to find out whether this procedure , which can be applied to any patient who has reached the age of 18 , is suitable for you .
varicose vein is not used in heart surgery !
varicose veins are an increasingly common disease in recent years .
the fact that genetic proximity is the primary factor leads to an increase in complaints of long working hours , work that requires long standing in the foot , and long sitting complaints .
are veins used in heart surgery ?
there are also questions such as what i am going to do if i have a heart attack in the future , and it is often wondered by people .
here are the answers to these questions .
there are two types of venous system in the leg :
1 . there is a deep vein system , which is the main path leading to the lungs of dirty blood in the leg and collecting the main dirty blood of the leg .
they are called deep femoral venous and superficial femoral venous .
the problems in these veins are less common , the vasculature can not be closed in diseases and drug treatments are applied to keep these veins open .
there is a superficial venous system that we refer to as a side-path that leads to dirty blood in the legs and to the deep vein system in the groin .
this system consists of two large and two small safen veins .
four of these vessels may develop insufficiency and varicose veins .
the veins that can be used in heart surgery are superficial veins called large saphen veins .
without these vessels there is no harm in the body and therefore they can be used in heart surgery .
however , in order for these vessels to be used in cardiac surgery , the vessels must be healthy .
because the heart is a very important organ .
the operation of taking varicose veins by operation or leaving the laser in place reduces the workload of deep veins and helps to make the stomach healthier .
a false belief among the people is that the veins can be used as substitutes if they are inherited .
varicose veins never and never used in heart surgery !
there are other vessels that can be used in heart surgery .
the reserve vascular systems that can be used in heart surgery are located beneath the rib cage , around the wrist and on the wrist .
hence it is unwise to wait for the varicose vein to use for the heart and to worry about it .

scot callum skinner flies home while britain grabs gold
scottish callum skinner ran into the men &apos;s race at the rio race track last night , while the great britain &apos;s team triumph 2012 retained their title from london .
the glasgow , 23-year-old racer took on the pioneering role adopted by scottish sir chris hoy and made this legend proud when he returned home victorious with this young , acclaimed new zealand garment .
in the event four years before hoy bought five of the six olympic gold , britain had a shock victory .
and despite hoy &apos;s retirement , he finished in the sixth place in the race world championship in london in march , repeating it .
the problem between beijing and london was the replacement of expert starter jamie staff .
that &apos;s exactly what hindes did when they came out .
hoy &apos;s retirement also created a gap that kian emadi and matt crampton tried to fill .
scott had already anticipated the potential he had realized and the british coaches had not given up on skinner .
hindes , kenny and skinner , who were with hoy four years ago , broke the olympic record in the qualifying round , but in the first round new zealand set the record again .
and the british trio went out for the gold .
hindes was a little behind in their round , but kenny brought the team forward and skinner was up to it .
using a larger tool to slow hindes himself , this strategy change was the major part of the transformation that enabled kenny and skinner to keep their tempo .
hoy watched them as an expert commentator on the bbc , and skinner , kenny , and hindes watched when they came out of the podium .
skinner , 23 , of glasgow , said : &quot; this is an honorable comparison . &quot;
i &apos;m just here to make the best of what &apos;s coming through and announce my name .
olympic record in the finals is broken and we beat the world champions .
that was really amazing .
there can not be a better way of winning it .
hindes confessed that he had deliberately dropped the pitch after the bad start , after winning the victory with kenny and hoy in london 2012 .
he then reacted to this interpretation and there was no way of submitting a request from britain &apos;s opponents .
this time , it was not such a problem for an incredible victory .
hindes said : &quot; it seemed like we were in london with all the great britain flags on the stand . &quot;
we &apos;re just a team that was founded three months ago .
it is truly incredible feeling to have won the olympics again because we lost so many world races .
this is just an event , a medal for a nation that has won seven races in beijing and london .
if the progress we have made in the past five months is the measure , we are waiting for five more days to pass successfully at the race track .
the attitude kenny adopts shows that the fantasy of hoy &apos;s recurring record of winning three golds in a single olympics is not impossible .
this means that kenny will reach six gold medals and a silver medal , which is exactly 12 years younger than hoy and who was born march 23 ( also the birthday of steve redgrave , mo farah and roger bannister ) .
that &apos;s the same level as hoy .
kenny will now be in the sprint race , the race will start today and last for three days .
at the age of 28 , bolton said : &quot; i am just enjoying it for now .
team events are always the best events .
you can win with your friends .
honestly , when you win by yourself , you feel alone .
hindes said : &quot; if you win two more gold medals , you must be given the knight title . &quot;
this is just the medal of the day , but there are many good news for britain .
sir bradley wiggins , ed clancy , steven burke and owain doull completed the first round of the four-man , four-kilometer team race .
the track was completed at 3 : 51.943 .
the gold medal winner in london 2012 world record 3 : 51.659 .
the first round and the final ( 22 : 42 ) will be set in the second part of today , and it is certain that wiggins will draw all the attention .
yesterday , the officials had a disagreement with the officers at the time of the ordering , when the authorities called him to measure his neck .
laura trott , joanna rowsell shand , elinor barker and milngavie &apos;s katie archibald reached the world record for the duration of 4 : 13,260 .
the great britian team relies on the powerful cycling team to handle the reins and win several medals during the mid-term of the olympic games .
after great excellence in beijing and london , expectations in rio were considerably reduced .
there were many bad developments on the back , including the april resignation of coach shane sutton &apos;s sexism and bullying charges and the retirement of key figures like hoy and victoria pendleton .
but the first night after the race on the track shows that great britain &apos;s legendary reputation for finishing the perfect period can be proven again this time .
with the cancellation of the energy contract , the suspect of the future of the portland smelter
the future of portland &apos;s aluminum smelting furnace in victoria and the work of hundreds of workers has become uncertain after explaining the termination of a supply agreement by one of the plant owners , resulting in the cancellation of all procurement contracts of the energy-supplying energy company .
the move followed a decision earlier this year by the victoria government to ensure that subsidies are not overcome so that the installation continues to work .
the 20-year fixed subsidy expires in november .
up to 2000 in alcoa &apos;s portland facility may be at risk .
any shutdown can cause up to 2000 jobs to be put at risk , either directly or indirectly .
and since the burner consumes about 10 percent of all of victoria &apos;s electricity , additional chained effects can also occur .
in 2014 , alcoa point henry closed the burning stove , which led to the closing of the anglesea power plant last year .
alcoa &apos;s portland smelter plant is losing money and faces the risk of closure .
these developments have emerged after several years of speculation for the future of the mill , initially based on the strength of the australian dollar and the recent consumption rate of the mill .
agl , which supplies energy from the power plant to loy yang in latrobe valley , is waiting for the other three owners to take action to dissolve their contracts .
a large majority of the plant belongs to the joint venture of alcoa and alumina , and citic of china and marubeni corp. of japan have smaller feelings .
&quot; agl expects the portland plant to continue to work , which means that the burning heat will continue to require physical electricity , &quot; he said .
the agl stated that the contracts are &quot; risk-balancing agreements &quot; that should enter into force from november 2016 .
the contracts will be completed in 2017 since they have a 12-month termination period .
&quot; for this reason , the agl will continue to expect the contracts to contribute to the fiscal year 2017 , &quot; the energy company said .
the impact that agl could have on potential earnings in 2018 fiscal year and beyond is currently limited to the adoption of a strong futures contract stance for wholesale electricity prices .
agl stated that the value of their contracts for accounts has already fallen by $ 187 million due to &quot; termination &quot; .
alcoa stated that the decision to terminate the contracts &quot; does not affect alcoa &apos;s ability to supply electricity to the operating or smoldering furnace . &quot;
the us company signed a 20-year contract in 2010 , which should have come into force this november , but has not yet announced why it will not be withdrawn from the contract .
analysts are on the verge of shutting down the portland smelter of victoria in victoria and the tomago plant near newcastle due to the economic downturn in the sector .
stephen mikkels , agl &apos;s operations manager , who responded to analysts earlier this week , said that portland uses about 600 megawatts of energy each year and tomago uses 900 megawatts of energy each year .
if both of these plants are withdrawn from the market , the demand on the &#91; electricity &#93; market will cause it to fall significantly .
and as producers , this is not a good development for us , &quot; he said .
not just the star of the kardashian tv program , kendall is on the cover of vogue &apos;s september issue
kendall jenner ( 20 ) , the fourth daughter of the model and executive mother kris kardashian-jenner , is on the verge of the september vogue &apos;s september appearance .
kendall , who is an estee lauder brand ambassador and who shows up in milan , paris and new york fashion week , announces this news on his instagram account on thursday .
kendall wrote , &quot; i cried when i looked at this door in a room full of people i love . &quot;
following the release of the cover , a strange reality ( specific to keeping up with the kardashians program ) , in which the entire kardashian-jenner family ( rob and caitlyn and the uncaring uncle of the hustle-busting show world ryan seacrest ) was featured , the family who forgot the cover of the sisters on the video later made a classic ending : they were actually preparing a surprise party .
although this is the cliché story line of every &quot; birthday &quot; episode of almost all children &apos;s television shows ( seacrest says , &quot; do you think we forgotten you ? &quot; with a cartoon rabbitship sincerity at 8 am ) kris had to include the other girls in this introduction as well .
with this development in vogue &apos;s september issue , it is certain that we have entered a new kardashian era .
kendall &apos;s older sister , kim , may have passed him on closure of vogue ( the clapper shared his wife with kanye west in april 2014 ) , but the september cover of the magazine is a success in itself .
vogue &apos;s september number was the best-selling number of the year .
with its thickness resembling a coffee table book rather than a fashion magazine , this number attracted the attention of many advertisers ( fashionista found that there was advertising content on last year &apos;s 832-page skin 615 ) .
the explanation of the cover star is also a closely watched process , the pictures of the magazine being leaked in the past two years before the official announcement .
naomi campbell , linda evangelista and kate moss are among the women who have been on the cover before .
in recent years , the cover has been featured in &quot; the famous models that are more &quot; modeling &quot; than the &quot; famous ones &quot; .
oscar-winning dior ambassador jennifer lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , the next year this honor was bestowed on lady gaga .
however , even if mrs. jenner , who is described by the magazine as the &quot; shining model &quot; of neslin , has taken the previous categorization , it can be said that her surroundings are quite good .
these celebrities are not relatives of famous people or reality show stars or teenagers who know how to shoot good snapchat videos ( though jenner is all of them ) .
these are all women who stand out in the entertainment industry , whose talent is legitimate .
beyonce , who was on the cover of last year , spent one of the best times of his career with the release of lemonade .
of course , not everyone is happy with jenner &apos;s success .
due to the reality show history , jenner &apos;s position in the fashion world will always be uncomfortable .
in june , stephanie seymour , the original victoria &apos;s secret model , criticized jenner and her colleague gigi hadid , calling them &quot; timeless wonders &quot; .
when the news came out that jenner would be on vogue &apos;s door , this thought surfaced again .
but focusing on dissatisfaction seems out of place .
kendall jenner is on the verge of the september issue of vogue .
he is literally a super model of glove .
he goes to marc jacobs &apos; defenses .
estee lauder is giving you a foundation .
he , along with his sisters , sells his own paintings on the pay-per-use applications .
she sells cindy crawford &apos;s daughter &apos;s pictures to love magazine .
and in his spare time , maybe it &apos;s just in the reality show on tv to see his brother kourtney and his kids .
social legal support centers turn down 160,000 people each year
more than 160,000 people from the most vulnerable part of the nation are turned away from social legal support centers , while the sector is preparing for more interruptions in financing operations , which are already in force .
in queensland , three out of five ( mostly elderly , immigrants , vulnerable workers , victims of violence , and those who do not fight unfair evacuation decisions , and so on ) are turned away for free legal advice and representation .
the social legal support services , which have exhausted their facilities , are being prepared for further interruptions .
from june next year , it is planned that these legal support centers will be deprived of more than 30 percent of federal funding .
james farrel , queensland director of community legal support centers , reported that the national civic support centers &apos; recent census report found that thousands of people were turned away every year .
mr. farrel said that if the federal government &apos;s decision is not taken back , the situation will get worse .
&quot; queensland &apos;s social legal support centers are chronically financially underprivileged , which means thousands of people can not reach the vital services they need , &quot; he said .
those who are in violent relations , struggling with power and backing powers , families in separation , and unjustified workers ... all of these are facing legal issues , and according to this report , they can not get the help they need .
the federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent by june 2017 , which means thousands of queensland residents in unprotected status have to cope without getting help with more complex legal issues .
we urge the justice minister and queensland senator george brandis to immediately withdraw this disruption of funding so that people can receive the support they need when faced with a legal problem .
last year , the government fulfilled its promise to raise the level of legal aid financing to the national average level .
now we must look at the social legal support centers and the societies that they serve and the investment that the palaszczuk government will make for this important work .

supervised asset fund resumed in commission
the turkey asset fund , which is expected to be one of the largest funds in the world , has been removed from the ban on silent bags on objections .
it was decided that the fund would not be re-negotiated because it lacked the supervisory mechanism , but it was discussed again at the committee before any changes were made .
utp Çakırözer , a member of the chp deputy and the planning and budget commission who evaluates the turkish asset fund law proposal on sozcu.com.tr , said , &quot; we absolutely oppose this structure , which will be made out of the unemployment fund collected for the unemployed by the pensioners , the pensions to be taken from the workers , the laborers , the constitutional control mechanisms .
the government &apos;s proposal for a law on the turkey asset fund , which the government prepared to provide long-term funding to investments and projects , was removed from the bag on tuesday , with the opposition holding that it should be discussed separately .
however , the akp has re-introduced the proposal to the plan and budget commission today .
parliamentary plan and budget commission member of the chp eskisehir deputy utku Çakırözer , asset fund law proposal related to the concerns and worries of the chp told sozcu.com.tr .
Çakırözer , &quot; when this plan came to the planning and budget commission , the former finance minister zekeriya temizel , who was at the head of the chp delegation , expressed his worries and anxieties and suggested that it should be removed from the bag and also discussed in detail .
the government , which accepted this view , withdrew the design .
the bill came to the commission yesterday again in the same way .
&quot; the government seems to insist on removing it from the parliament in a week , &quot; he said .
stating that there should be a consensus on the issue of the asset fund law , Çakırözer said , &quot; our biggest concern in this law proposal is irregularity . &quot;
&quot; the entities belonging to the public are being duly imposed on the workers , the obligations to be taken from the employees , the incomes from the unemployment fund collected for the unemployed , the incomes to be obtained from the privatization , the structure outside the control of the assembly and the court of accounts and without any responsibility &quot; .
Çakırözer stated that the funds of russia , china and the gulf countries that these funds are established are in excess of the oil incomes and trade and that the fund is financed in this way .
so the fund will be made up of public resources , that is , the people &apos;s money .
it is planned to transfer 100 billion from the individual pension fund , 50 billion from the privatization , to the total of 100 billion in the unemployment fund , made obligatory to the employees .
&quot; that means that this fund , which will be formed entirely by the people , must be under public supervision and this money should not be irresponsible . &quot;
Çakırözer emphasized that it is unacceptable to exclude a fund in which the state &apos;s resources are collected and a state in which the assets of the state are covered by collateral are excluded from the parliamentary audit , and expressed concern and worries about the proposal of the asset fund law :
the work and transactions relating to the collection , expenditure , borrowing on behalf of the public of such a large public entity can not be overridden only by the independent audit companies .
it is absolutely necessary to have public inspection and a transparent structure .
in the law proposal , the asset fund does not have provisions on the supervision and transparency of constitutional institutions .
there is no limit to how much resources can be transferred .
no one will be able to ask about how this fund is used .
the fund is justified as financing large projects .
there is no need to set up an unchecked fund other than the budget for this .
why do not you budget it ?
as such , the question naturally comes to mind , &quot; why is the supreme court and the parliament avoided ? &quot; .
stating that they are not opposed to the transfer of the money to the investments in the asset fund , but they are opposed to this being done with non-transparent , non-accountable mechanisms , Çakırözer continued : &quot; is there such a need for debate possible ? &quot;
but if the government insists on this , then we have to ensure that international standards applicable in other countries where such mutual funds are established also apply in turkey .
it must be structured in a way that has an absolute control and responsibility mechanism .
if there are no chasms on it , it must be established in such a way as to give the account of the citizen &apos;s own money to the account until the end of the year .
&quot; we are pleased that the akp is listening to our criticisms in the assembly especially after the july 15 coup attempt . &quot;
we hope that the akp will listen to our constructive criticism in this law proposal .
we are opposed to the illegal use , the transfer , the irresponsibility and the lack of public control of national assets .
&quot; the desired asset fund can only be useful if these concerns are resolved , &quot; he said .
on the proposal of the law , the akp and the opposition learned that work was done to ensure consensus .
&quot; the investments we have made in turkey are the indicators of trust &quot;
speaking at a meeting in istanbul , ford otomotiv chairman ali koç said , &quot; our investment of 30 billion tl in the last 5 years is a strong indication of our country &apos;s future . &quot;
deputy chairman of koç holding board of directors and ford otomotiv chairman ali koç and many other foreign-funded company managers came together at a meeting organized by the istanbul chamber of industry ( iso ) on the subject of &quot; trusted in turkey , produced in turkey &quot; .

our investment of 30 billion tl in the last 5 years is an indication of our confidence in the future of our country .
it is an ecosystem that encourages turkey to attract more foreign investment , a credible and fair legal system , a democracy at international standards , qualified workforce and r &amp; d , innovation , entrepreneurship and added value .
in the last few years , our industrialists have provided the most comprehensive incentives of our republican history .
&quot; i believe that these incentives and holistic strategies have used the phrase &quot; we can start a new investment bond &quot; that we need .
siemens industry and commerce turkey chairman and chief executive officer hüseyin gelis said : &quot; now we know this as a global player , not just a problem of one country . &quot;
we came to turkey with a long-term perspective .
if we are in unity and solidarity , our problems will always be solved .
we 160 years ago we could bring to this land what could not be in turkey .
we will continue to be found in these areas in turkey .
&quot; of course we will plant factories , but this horizon must be open , &quot; he said .
shell turkey country president ahmet erdem stated that turkey is one of the top 10 countries for them . &quot; turkey is one of the top 10 countries for shell . &quot;
we believe in the potential and future of turkey .
we have invested in many areas , primarily energy , and we continue to do so .
we thank the president , prime minister and ministers for their support of international investors .
there are studies that give confidence to international investors .
&quot; this will also increase our country &apos;s competitive power , &quot; he said .
sandoz / novartis turkey and middle east region president dr. altan demirdere , &quot; on august 10 , the global ceo will come to turkey . &quot;
but travel was delayed .
we opposed it .
because the ceo &apos;s coming was very important .
bulletproof car , protection , such as requests .
then when he got here he saw everything was normal .
he left the guards and the car and returned happily to his country .
investing in a country is like marriage .
first of all , if everything goes well , you will be engaged and married with a long-term plan .
we are married to turkey and have no intention of divorce .

&quot; adding value is high , if our country is locomotive and we care to catch the 2023 targets , we should think together with the industrial revolution , information and technology revolution , and we have to do it , &quot; he said .
on july 15th , prime minister yıldırım added that turkey is returning on the brink of a great abyss . &quot; we have been talking about another turkey today , even if they succeeded , they meant the future of our country , those who tried to destroy democracy , the ones who did not hesitate even from the bombs of our gazi assembly . &quot;
the coup was taken over by the administration , the national will was abolished and the world would have fallen from the league of developing countries , we would talk about a turkey among the 3rd world countries .

prime minister yıldırım continued his words as follows : &quot; we will take a quick look at the impact of this incident and look forward to it . &quot;
our life with a continuous blow never and never is right .
we have very ambitious goals ahead .
this coup attempt did not shake the turkish economy .
chaos and those who were waiting for the crisis were once again mistaken .
today our democracy and our economy are well balanced .
our banking sector , our finance sector continues to work in a healthy manner .
foreign trade deficit in 2015 seems to have fallen by 25 percent .
while the ratio of national income to national income is 5.8 per cent in 2014 , this ratio has declined to 4.5 per cent in 2015 .
we aim to reduce it to 4 by the end of this year .
we will never change our strict position in public finance .
turkey &apos;s 2016 budget is higher than the national income of 130 countries .
we have reduced the national income rate of the budget deficit , which is above 11 percent , to 1.3 percent by 2015 , and strive to preserve these rates .
we are better off in the public debt than the eu , many countries of the world .
our banking finance industry continues to work on a solid ground .
&quot; our central bank did not need to give foreign currency to the market despite the 15th of july , and there is no reduction in reserves , we have over 121 billion gross reserves &quot; .

we continue to spend a lot of money on stock arrangements ranging from cash-in-excess and unpaid tax debts to redeployment and installment of assets .

britain must channel the olympic soul and expand heathrow
heathrow will offer renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and in london , but also across the country .
i think it will make heathrow as attractive as it is in london 2012 , where we have made an incredible effort to benefit all the nations and regions from games .
the olympics provided great advantages for stratford and the east end .
and we will achieve this again by creating opportunities for local people and companies close to heathrow .
we will only have 10,000 new internships for our local communities , 40,000 new jobs and we will not leave unemployed youth around the airport .
there will be those who think that the struggle to expand heathrow is too difficult , as it was before london 2012 .
i was told that britain would never be able to prepare for the games and that we would be disgraced all over the world .
those who have doubts were wrong in 2012 and they will be seen to be wrong about heathrow .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but heathrow answers all the questions asked .
as in the olympics , heathrow is not just a few people , but an infrastructure project for many people .
the expansion has the opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs and £ 211 billion in economic growth and leaves many skills and jobs available both around the airport and throughout the uk .
we have a great team at heathrow who has invested in a timely and budget-friendly £ 11 billion infrastructure investment between the two busiest stations in the world , from the t5 ( selected as the world &apos;s best airport terminal for five consecutive years ) to the t2 .
we are now ready to offer a third track , backed by a £ 16 billion private investment .
the london 2012 games were a big success for the uk and there is no doubt that the expansion of heathrow will be so .
it is time for us to assure our commercial future by channeling this olympic spirit to the expansion of heathrow and to create many skills and jobs that britain will be proud of .
lord paul deighton is the chairman of the board of directors of heathrow and the secretary of commerce of the former treasury department
adblock plus , facebook ad blocking &quot; like cat-and-mouse game &quot;
for companies that earn money from online advertising , attempts to block ad blocking software are reminiscent of &quot; cat-and-mouse &quot; , according to one of the software makers .
on thursday , just two days after facebook announced that it would block ad blockers on its desktop site , adblock plus posted a blog post saying that users could update their filters to block ads on the social network .
on tuesday , facebook said that ad blockers would change the codes around the ads to make it harder to determine which part of the page was the ad .
but adblock now says you unlocked the new codes .
in a blog post , ben adblock spokesman ben williams wrote that &quot; this is a forward-looking trade-off between the community of blocking open-source ads and those trying to prevent them , since the invention of adblocking has been invented &quot; and facebook is likely to produce its own solution in the near future .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered this struggle shows how much concern the ad blockers have for the industry .
last year , according to a study by pagefair and adobe , around 200 million people globally use an ad blocker , which is four times the number of people using software this way in 2013 .
with 1.03 billion daily active users accessing facebook via mobile devices , mobile ads now account for 84 percent of facebook &apos;s ad revenue .
according to one spokesperson , mobile adblockers have been in the pursuit of corporate ad blockers on the company desktop because it is not effective for facebook &apos;s mobile apps and instagram for social networking .
as facebook sees such a move worth investing in , desktop ads should still be able to generate enough revenue .
also tuesday , facebook announced that it would update its &quot; ad preferences &quot; tool so people can better control which ads are served to them .
on thursday , facebook claimed that adblock &apos;s new filters were alarming , and that some of the ad-free content on the site would also block some .
a facebook spokesman said in an e-mailed biography &quot; we are not offering these people a good experience and we are planning to deal with this issue . &quot;
the ad blockers are a faded vehicle , so we &apos;re focused on creating tools like ads preferences to give control to people .

the event took place in the vaud canton in the a1 near morges , right after midnight thursday night .
the vaud police said in a statement that the woman was lying &quot; in a desperate way &quot; in the darkness of the night , and that a few vehicles hit him .
a swedish woman , aged 49 , who was obviously keen to kill herself , hit a few vehicles , including a truck .
he lost his life at the scene .
the police stated that they were seeing several of the drivers involved but some of them could not be identified and asked them and everyone involved to refer to them .
lawyer gilles hofstetter said in le tribune de geneve that a &quot; criminal prosecution &quot; was launched as a &quot; logical &quot; step to be taken in situations like this &quot; .
however , it is not yet known whether the drivers involved will face any charges .
could it be avoided without collision ?
that &apos;s what the prosecutor has to figure out , &quot; hofstetter said .
two similar cases over the past five years indicate that drivers will not be held accountable .
the voicemail was ruled that it was normal for drivers not to expect to see a passenger on the highway in the middle of the night at half-time ( both included a person who snooped in the dark ) .
last year , in august 2014 , a police officer who caused his death by hitting a man lying on the road near the porterne in a1 was not guilty of causing death because of negligence .
in court , it was expressed that the victim of the 22-year-old was drinky and infiltrated on the road .
the court stated that the police officer responding to an emergency call was using the vehicle reasonably and that the presence of a man on the road was &quot; a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation &quot; .
those who have information about the incident that took place near morges on thursday should call the police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 .
nasa climate model : venus is suitable for a time
according to estimates of the new nasa climate model , venus had conditions suitable for some time to live .
the scientists at the nasa goddard space studies institute have developed a model to explore the past of venus , using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine whether venus was once home to earth-like conditions with its warm , water-free surface and co2-filled atmosphere .
scientists used to describe the low spin rate of venus in the past with the thick atmosphere layer .
but the most recent estimates suggest that venus may have had a subtle , earth-like atmosphere , and that it could still turn slowly .
the model also looked at the topography of the ancient venus .
even though the planet has more dry regions than earth , it may have had adequate water and geographical variability and rapid evaporation protection .
the old venus also benefited from a dimmer sunlight at about 30 percent .
giss scientist anthony del genio , in a news release , said , &quot; in the simulation of the giss model , the slow turn of venus would have made the daylight side facing the sun for almost two months each time . &quot;
this led to rains forming thick layers of clouds that acted like an umbrella protecting the surface from solar-induced warming by heating the surface .
as a result , only a few degrees colder average climate temperatures were emerging from the earth &apos;s present day .
the model enabled venus to create a story similar to evolution that the planet scientists previously hypothesized as a hypothesis .
although once in a lifetime , venus has been exposed to a lot of heat and ultraviolet light in a few billion years .
the oceans have evaporated and the water vapor has vanished by the ultraviolet light .
hydrogen was consumed and there was only a thick atmosphere left behind with only deadly greenhouse gas effect , namely venus as we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of the new venus climate model in the geophysical research articles .
patrick roy stepped down from the avalanche antennae
patrick roy resigned from colorado avalanche coaching and hockey operations vice president on thursday , saying the team was not given a say in the decision-making process .
joe sakic , colorado vice president / general manager , approved this development and stated that his club would immediately start looking for a new coach .
&quot; in the past three years , i have fulfilled my duties as vice president of chief coaching and hockey operations in colorado avalanche with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said roy , 50 , in his statement .
during the summer i thought it was a long way to improve and improve how i can get to a higher level by giving it the depth that i need .
to achieve this , the vision of the coach and vp hockey operations must be in perfect harmony with the vision of the founding .
you also need to have a say in decisions affecting your team &apos;s performance .
at present , these conditions are not yet met .
by adding roy to the team on may 23 , 2013 , sakic thanked roy for the contributions he made .
sakic said , &quot; patrick made me aware of his decision today . &quot;
we thank him for everything we do for our organization and we wish him good luck in the future .
roy won the jack adams prize as the best coach of the league in his first season of 2013-14 with avalanche .
the club earned 112 points and allowed the team to finish the league first , but colorado lost to minnesota on the first round of the play-off season and missed the post-season games every two years .
avalanche crossed the 39-39-4 target in 2015-16 and received five points less than necessary for the second wildcard field in the western conference .
honor roll keeper roy won four stanley cups , two for montreal canadiens and two for avalanche .
north sea oil workers continue to negotiate by grabbing hatches
north sea oil workers were hired for the strike because of wages , and chief negotiators began debating for a new round of talks .
the strike against the oilfield services company wood group is being carried out gradually on platforms in the north sea operated by royal dutch shell .
&quot; we decided to resume the process for the settlement of the current dispute with wood group as unite and rmt unions , &quot; a joint statement said .
over the next few weeks , we will be organizing a series of full day-long meetings to adopt a new perspective on issues from the beginning of the next week .
workers &apos; unions stated that this protest was the first action since 25 years against wage cuts that could reach 30 per cent .
this year , wood group cut approximately 9 percent in payments to contractors in the north sea due to negative pressures in the market .
after the company &apos;s wage reduction process , a 10 percent price reduction was applied to the coastal contractors in 2014 .
the company said additional cuts would provide the company with the space needed to get through the troubled period in the market .
shell , with its british energy company bg group , announced that it would cut thousands of people out of their business while they were gearing up for their operations in the merger process , and plans to release oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries .
energy companies are under pressure because of the low crude oil prices , an economic situation that britain &apos;s decision to leave the european union in june has caused .
dave anderson , a member of the scottish parliament , will meet with workers &apos; leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes in the north sea .
as he says , the north sea is vital to the regional economy .
he said in a statement , &quot; we need an effective economy for the majority , not for the north sea and for the whole country . &quot;
despite an average investment of nearly $ 7 billion over the past five years , it is expected to invest less than $ 1.4 billion in new projects in the north sea in 2016 .
kepler , ulker measure the rotation speed of the stars in the team star
the kepler space telescope has helped astronomers to create the most complete catalog of astronomical stars in terms of their rotation speed .
the new data helps astronomers understand why stars in the team star are spinning at varying speeds and that the period of rotation is related to planetary formation .
luisa rebull , a research scientist at caltech &apos;s infrared processing and analysis center in pasadena , said in a news release , &quot; when we compare our results with star clusters , we hope to learn more about the relationship between a star &apos;s mass , age , and even the history of the solar system . &quot;
Ülker &apos;s team star is 445 light years away from earth .
most of the stars in the team star formed 125 million years ago and reach new levels of adulthood .
they return at the highest possible speed throughout their lives .
at peak rotation speeds , the stars at this stage of maturation generate a large amount of star wind .
as these winds advance in the magnetic fields of the stars , they create a breaking effect on the stars .
as a star ages , the speed of rotation begins to fall .
kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by monitoring the time between visible star spots , such as sun spots .
the latest spin rates catalog suggests that larger stars are spinning faster than smaller stars .
rebull compared the stars to the dancers and stated that the bigger ones made their turns on one foot slower than the smaller ones .
rebull says , &quot; on ulker , we see that slower revolutions are much heavier and fast revolutions are very light stars . &quot;
since Ülker &apos;s team star is very close , it is an ideal cosmic laboratory for comparing star characteristics and rotation speeds .
&quot; the ulker team star provides theoretical models for star returns in both ways , young and old , &quot; says rebull .
there are more things we want to know about how the stars &apos; spin speeds fall , when , and why , and why they leave &apos; dance shoes &apos; on a corner if it is clear .
rebull and his colleagues explained in detail the latest analysis of the ulker team star about their speed of rotation in three new articles to be published shortly in the astronomy magazine .
