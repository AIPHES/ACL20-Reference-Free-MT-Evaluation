russia and turkey : a &apos; misfits alliance &apos; ?
this was a gesture that ended the crisis .
the leaders of russia and turkey on the day tuesday with a handshake and the words , and continuing with the economic sanctions , the war has been terminated , eight months to announce that we officially met .
however , in the hallowed halls of the palace greets his turkish counterpart vladimir putin in st. petersburg , i got the impression obvious that this compromise by seeking a maximum of ankara .
el sikisild , yes .
but mr. putin &apos;s smile was weak and he wasn &apos;t spreading any warmth , even against their own standards is quite limited .
on the contrary , recep tayyip erdogan has repeatedly &quot; best friend &quot; told me about mr. putin ; according to a report five times .
i &apos;m surprised at the number .
he also relations with russia at pre-crisis levels won &apos;t come back when it has pledged will reach much higher levels .
the next day , a paper here were acting as if nothing bad had ever happened in mr erdogan &apos;s expressed .
just the thrill of it showed the opposite .
however , mr. putin gave the impression that cold around , the leaders of russia showed that you haven &apos;t forgotten anything .
in fact , in his opening statement mentioned the first thing that was the cause of the crisis : russian warplanes shot down the syrian border in turkey .
then russia &apos;s reaction was full of rage .
mr putin , a tough debut ankara and moscow is accused of stabbing in the back .
the friend was believed to have been a lot of resentment of the other side bigger .
a real sense of trust to rebuild , it will be difficult , perhaps impossible .
the idea of the russian people since the month of november have changed .
the state-controlled media , in a manner that ankara was aimed at shocking and offensive for months .
suddenly , the turks were to blame for everything .
of these the most serious , the so-called islamic state in syria , mr erdogan &apos;s family of the senior officials in the areas under the control of the profit charges that were obtained from illegal oil trade .
he categorically refused .
however , the official message from st. petersburg , was that it was time to move on .
ultimately , the realization of this meeting , the president demanded apology from the minister of the reason for mr. putin got what that meant .
russia may be seen as a victory of a sort .
call a truce for ankara of the benefits are very clear .
first , erdogan last month occurred in the aftermath of the failed coup which will cause you to fall over and almost needs friends .
i am very impressed by the recurring terror attacks in turkey itself .
also , for economic reasons , too enabled .
russia sanctions hit hard , especially every year , several million tourists to the coastal regions of turkey , carrying russian special time of prohibition .
this number is almost 90 % by fell .
tour operators and rental companies in russia will continue flights also definitely relieved .
do they depend on the density at the end of the season in the mediterranean .
and this week , state television , turkish imports of agricultural products that would be predicted to again being allowed with a reduction in fruit and vegetable prices .
we are going to take a page from a story in the newspaper vedomosti , &quot; if the tourists there , the tomatoes here &quot; .
however , there was a separate political value of the visit to moscow available .
ankara is angry because west &apos;s reaction to the coup attempt found inadequate .
progress at the negotiations on accession to the united states for a long time due to the speed of a snail when added to the anger that turkey &apos;s breaking off ties with the west , mr putin and who want to benefit from the coldness between them is activated .
definitely call support because elected officials in the aftermath of the coup attempt russian leader collected from ankara sympathy looks .
we must not forget that , about regime change and also a deep-rooted fear this was inevitable to moscow carrying an attitude .
this ornate palace by the sea , held in this summit , russia , and turkey analyst , explained to me in a way like &quot; misfits &quot; alliance represents the west and refusing bad acting , the two countries join forces .
this consensus still on display , despite the appearance they are quite different from each other .
one of the most important of these about syria : russia and turkey as a mediator , although support different parts of moscow itself .
the first , which lasted almost three hours after the talks , the two presidents at a press conference to say that is not much information about this subject supports it .
the president of turkey , while avoiding to clearly answer questions related to these differences , mr putin chose to underline them .
there is a clear consensus on how to identify common ground in syria .
however , the ongoing hostilities is clearly for months - and after russian warplanes shot down nato-member turkey , with the resulting absolute given the potential for disaster - at least to start the conversation the two leaders is definitely a good development .

within this period , brand strategists , and other consumer finance to protect their brands &apos; rbs used .

for customers in republic of ireland and northern ireland ulster bank the brand currently is being used .
retail banking is also available for smaller brands to undertake a much more pressing task ; coutts , adam &amp; co . , drummond and holt &apos;s military bank .
mr. mcewan , inverness-shire , gave an interview on an organized tour for customers and staff .
he told bbc scotland : &quot; after that , more and more brands now that we will be a bank investor which employs our personnel and our brand the brand brand the rbs it won &apos;t be . &quot;
the bank itself become a global brand , as rbs has become a global brand .
now the global not local i am saying that is our goal .
each of these brands will be highlighted in the community one resides in a slightly different manner , and our staff will work with customers under the name of these brands .
rbs six nation championship will continue to sponsor about sponsorship and sports has announced that it is raising the profile of different brands .
chairman of the executive board , &quot; now it &apos;s time to switch brands to approach the bank ( because we were asking ourselves ) can we do better for customers a bank ? &quot; he said .
three years ago , a great bank for our customers as we bring these brands and we will be disagreeing i would have found that we are alayvari .
but what we are doing ourselves and not customers &apos; needs with our focus on , i think you &apos;ll see a lot more changes .
we may retain this brand again , and i think this is the right time .

valuable health and happiness go a hunting type pokemon
to see how the world has changed is truly astonishing .
young people and children to play the game no longer out there , chooses to spend their free time staring at screens when for the past ten years , it was a situation where most people are upset .
people stood up from the couch and go to move pokemon is encouraging .
the time spent looking at the screen , especially in a time when television was limited to video games , and finally spread to a smart phone .
therefore , technology and mutually exclusive elements of moving in the open air to see if there are really great .
of course in the beginning created for the video game in the 90s ( later animated series , game boards , and other side products turned into the character of go which is an application based on the pokemon i &apos;m talking about .
as a phenomenon of popular culture , this new game also the beginning of july in the united states , australia and new zealand had added a lot of mess when it was presented .
then , the overload on the servers which causes the presentation was postponed because of the intense interest in other countries .
in a day and almost the same number of twitter users reached more than pokemon tinder go .
how does it work ?
in a nutshell , by taking their smartphones players , gps tracked by call up and find pokemon that are in the way of the &apos; allowed to take pictures &apos; ( on the phone taking a screenshot ) , or their &apos; catch &apos; .
played the game at a younger age out of the couch for the quest of a generation who joined in the frenzy .
the game in the united states , an &quot; average &quot; person has led to a significant increase in the number of the step every day .
the apple watch , which is an application that was developed for the following users and 35,000 cardiogram recently , the washington post among the people that followed the introduction of the game over the next two days , every day 30 day rate rose from 53 percent to 45 percent of people who exercise said .
the company who doesn &apos;t know go play pokemon ; it only can see the raw data on the level of exercise .
people say &quot; 30 minute time allocation &quot; , &quot; lifted from the couch &quot; and &quot; most public health campaigns , which encourage people to be active every day , most of the people that appear boring and miserable due to be passed by public health messages was ignored .
how vurgulansa the importance of exercise but still less .
individuals who exercise regularly , the possibility of cancer or depression is reduced .
exercise , weight control , high blood pressure and diabetes , and provides help on topics such as the list of advantages is too long to be listed here .
however , the beauty of the pokemon go , people to do something they enjoy is to take out .
in this way , three basic elements of health will also be covered : movement , fresh air and fun with sunlight .
you can obtain some people even new friends during the hunt .
as usual , searching for something to complain about a buzzkill grim is also available .
and , of course , slams the door as someone walked in .
what &apos;s the difference ?
a great innovation is presented .
although we follow the movement of firebit , such as smart phone applications did not offer a reason for us to do exercise like this game .
innovation will be the impact of the use of information and will decrease over time .
however , due to the success of pokemon , people who hunt through activities and virtual reality applications in the real world to merge with a more active , fit and healthy help to be many games which will be removed .

vinyl destination : purchasers of plaque really ?
middle-aged , lonely men vinile loves .
all the lonely , middle-aged men don &apos;t under the nickname glorious insults before you go to the comment section in order to make this statement let me say that based on the actual data .
yougov opinion , too , which is a physical object to the back of the plaque mentioned the innovation of the generation after the y , not the middle-aged is a consequence of nostalgia .
purchasers of the vinyl album recently , mostly between the ages of 45 and 54 .
in fact , the 18-24 age group has the lowest probability .
this also does not stem from the action of the spool just curious ; have an emotional significance ; older buyers , who likes to keep your feelings to yourself is usually vinyl ( 56 % and 53 % ) and who enjoys being alone ( 69 % and 66 % ) persons .
the results of yougov well correct ?
in this blog , if it was a televised news camera in a busy street of soho , in a modest gray suit , walking with my hands and gesture before stopping and after exhibiting many open , they would have let authoritarian say something like this : &quot; well , let &apos;s take a look then . &quot;
then , let &apos;s take a look .
the center of soho and unusual magic slowly lost in the air ( once located where the buildings are no longer independent vendors , hotels , eats , prets and filled with paperchaser ) is still available in a few specialist record store .
probably from the camera for the next part i wish i could stop it ; some of these stores in the different age and emotional state through the observation of men standing nearby , i would try to get information about .
sister ray ( count data : two young women , three middle-aged man ) reckless records ( data count : eight middle-aged man , probably a woman in her early 20s ) when i go i have followed the glaswegian stuart ( 55 ) , in the afternoon he spends in london for a meeting , and a few hours to fill the empty shops you are browsing .
a collector i &apos;m asking .
&quot; i think so , &quot; he says .
i have about 3000 or 4000 the plaque .
the picture located above , this plaque ( picture me with an e-mail , i didn &apos;t follow him home ) adorn the walls of the living room .
the cause of a collection of so many albums and singles , partly as a result of disposable income ; no longer young when they first came out and broke the plaque that she can &apos;t afford it at the time , you can buy and sell back can take .
&quot; most of the things i bought in the &apos; 60s &apos; 70s at the beginning , when i was only 11 or 12 they &apos;ll be too young to buy the stuff , &quot; he says .
record who likes to be alone , introverted people that are likely to be those who bought to the idea , agrees , and adds : &quot; i smoke , too much alcohol , too .
my bad i have this habit .
working on the sister ray ( 25 ) from the face of the yougov thinks he fits the profile of most of the customers .
however , affected by the media hype that there has been a new wave of fashion that you need to buy back the oldest records of the person who is coming back also i have noticed .
in negotiations , normally , in 1998 or in 1999 , i see people selling off their collections .
pre-selling cds vinyls to buy the cd now is selling their customers to retrieve the records , &quot; he says .
this can explain the increase of persons of a certain age , which recreates vinili .
what is the significance of the plates alleged emotional ?
like at a store phonica record store that consists of people with similar personalities , it is a comfort , it takes a few seconds to realize that a community has to offer .
wez , according to some older customers , especially , contactless payment system resents .
some vinyl enthusiasts , overwhelmed from the digital world and re-vinyl the stability of calm reminiscent of the memories of youth might want to take refuge in the familiar .
the he says , &quot; sometimes the reason for this may see it as a kind of comfort or material things fill a void . &quot;
since i am a collector myself and most people i have this too i think .
this is an easy way to fill your head .
a plaque jumps out from the pile , a colleague , &quot; it &apos;s like we &apos;re social workers , &quot; he says .
vinyl album of the area in the month of april a survey conducted last month by 50 % does not listen to the album yet revealed .
the survey at the same time , 41 % never used a truck and it is at 7 % although it does not have a record player , vinyl to purchase appeared .
news at this stage , probably would exhibit extremely anxious when examining the appearance of a series of bossa nova music .
this return of the &quot; reward &quot; aspect sounds of the universe ( census data : three middle-aged man ) johnny running ( 42 ) recognisable by an element .
&quot; recently , someone came up to me and said : &quot; i don &apos;t have a record player , but i want to get a radiohead record to put it on our shelves , &quot; he said .
even though this do not represent a large percentage , certainly reflects the current situation .
more product , less music .
that there are people who say : &quot; i don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
it &apos;s not that these seniors , teenagers , teens , at the end of this topic to new home builders .
almost an entire floor devoted to vinyl , which is when i reached fopp now , i see that the audience is quite variable .
70 years old , couples , tourists taking pictures , young boys and middle-aged women .
the atmosphere from the stores mentioned above ( the last part to confront the wild beast less ) the speakers instead of spreading calm and soothing jazz pop with sex content , although it is good to see the diversity among customers .
none of them , it doesn &apos;t look especially alone , but next to someone that &apos;s bothering them by staying for longer than 30 seconds to resolve the psychological trauma is difficult .
eleonora ( 27 ) , fopp wandering for a few minutes and takes a look at the plaque on sale .
instead of just went for window shopping to spend .
if you don &apos;t have the option of making itself more says he &apos;s not a record collection .
cost a lot .
it is easier to listen to music from the computer or in other ways , but the beauty of vinyl . &quot; like someone in love sighing away .
i don &apos;t know how to explain it really , there &apos;s nothing like it .
my last stop is said to inspire a new generation of vinyl enthusiasts store : urban outfitters .
as a father and his daughter was examining a pair of jeans while in advance of purchasing a crosley record player polaroid cameras for a while the debate about a group of young people gathered around a girl i &apos;ve been seeing .
on the left , adele , jeff buckley , amy winehouse , and there is a stairwell that is filled with fleetwood mac &apos;s records ; an average collection sine qua plaques ; there is a mix of modern and classic .
no one &apos;s looking ; maybe these are just for decoration purposes because some people are too high to be touched .
this is purely &quot; an artistic vinyl &quot; .
however , for these items the wonder industry will mean that customers can make more money and send less into the depths of soho ; the more subject there is to complain .
more money and time than most who have a demographic group , such as vinyl that would spend more money on luxury items more it &apos;s not surprising .
however , my findings of the results of the record shops in soho yougov it shows at least ; more than , in reality , in the record stores and vinyl collectors or enthusiasts in online forums they don &apos;t account for the women .
these people are probably at school or in the office has been working hard .
these individuals definitely browsing in a record store in berwick street on thursday evenings , by examining records and looking over the shoulders of middle aged men who don &apos;t know anything 30-year-old fled from the eyes of fake tv he &apos;s not having a server .

at the beginning of the day , the south african team in the semifinals they beat 7-5 in the final after crushing them , you may have found .
fiji , which is in the best shape but still , even with a team of 15 people could beat .
probably not very believable , though at least one would get a gold medal in the british in great britain tomorrow may find comfort in the fact that : fiji head coach , ryan , is a british wimbledon .
it &apos;s been quite a challenging journey for this great britain .
eight years ago , they lost every match in the championship sevens in adelaide working with ryan .

in the fourth minute , jerry wai tu the right wing was faced with a different curve number .
the match was 12-0 and great britain almost hadn &apos;t been able to touch the ball more .

with this number , the score to 29-0 at halftime was reached .
fiji 7s to play in the championship when you plug in an established , great britain , yet it was like he was trying to learn the basics .
it &apos;s more or less the situation .
big changes made between the circuit of great britain , fiji and the dam closed ; four full minutes for that perfect fiji tusovka until joshua was an improvement compared to the first half with the game till he hit the floor .
dan norton , great britain and the score 36-7 to make an attempt to put the ball in the left corner of the game even though you tried to the fans singing , waving flags and dancing were in the hands of south sea islanders .

helen glover and heather stanning , coaches taking inspiration from the fight against cancer , ran away with the victory on the shovel
these games gold and this also will be an important in a more emotional meaning .
the first move to the last painful breath from a 220 after helen glover and heather stanning , estadio da lagoa realized that he might be good in much more meaningful when they have the gold .
how two people pulling the oars , though the boat-there are three voices ; women in the race this year , double the uk as second consecutive olympic gold medal in the first women to reach such a level coaches in the process of advancing to the boat echoed in the voice of robin williams .
dominance was quite clear ; this is unprecedented for them , the invincibility of the series 39. it was the race .
in this image we see two amazing athletes we elegance swan floating on the surface doesn &apos;t do full justice to the nature of the victory .
each gold medal rowing in the back of incremental gains , there is this difference , willing to provide a battalion of hands , and no hand , 30 months ago when diagnosed with cancer who won &apos;t live long enough to see this day wasn &apos;t as effective coaches .
like he said , they touched , and they &apos;re gone .
i got caught types of bladder cancer surgically intervened and did just that .
if you do that , it goes everywhere .
this would be a pretty bad situation .
this changes your perspective on life a bit .
williams had been diagnosed in december 2013 .
itself , in the off-season , the 2014 triple lucky because it was at the beginning of treatment can begin , in cases like this it is not known whether this is a true statement , but in this way down will be able to minimize distraction .
i needed therefore i had to pay to heal rapidly .
this , for me , it was an incentive .
i was in the hospital and take a few steps in the garden , although it is enough to say that 6 , 9 , i was walking up to 15 feet .
in this way began .
it is a journey of its own , but raise it a little more rowing .
after the victory of their minds to overcome their concerns , talking a little more than usual , it was williams who had a tense morning .
standing in the royal artillery captain and the union previously gone to afghanistan , &quot; this week i was devastated emotionally , maybe that &apos;s a little extreme , but it really means a lot , &quot; he said .
this is what this means to me , and helen , and robin &apos;s once again that emphasizes how .
helen and i spent three great years with robin .
robin is the best coach in the world , therefore we wouldn &apos;t be without him because i would like to extend my greatest thanks .
i wouldn &apos;t have found a better coach or a better person to work with .
helen glover and heather stanning lost a race in five years .
binary challenging is the case of its competitors out of the reach of a rhythm has been established .
even when you close the last 500 feet between new zealand and danish teams at the power of glover and yet standing was exhausting .
then we lost ourselves .
helen &apos; the process watch and process watch &apos; were calling .
tide to go is really important .
we made a good start and we weren &apos;t trying to do something amazing .
i didn &apos;t expect the explosion of fireworks today , just a good paddling we did that we went by so we wanted to win the race .
binary will give dec a year before deciding what to do in the future .
i have a wedding to attend next month &apos;s glover ; he backshall and television adventurer steve &apos;s wedding .
for now , he just wants to savor this moment .
i didn &apos;t say that this is my last race i was in .
this would create too much pressure .
it took six months to realize i was an olympic champion in london .
this was very new and i was very stressed .
here , this lasted about four minutes .
it &apos;s a feeling that &apos;s much better , &quot; he said .

snapchat , the &quot; anime &quot; effect , was criticized as an asian cartoon
snapchat say that for this filter is inspired by the anime , although some observers , this means that in terms of racial insensitive .
snapchat , the lens with the tool every day , 150 million users by level allows you to play with identities changing the reality of the absurd .
a pineapple for yourself , you can convert a character out of a dog or a roy lichtenstein painting .
lenses every day improved over 30 million ozcek reckless creator , the property modifier tools .

snapchat lenses , supports classification of the application in the past or presented as the ideal of beauty for black skin tones beyazlastirilm charges he had faced .
therefore , this week &apos;s offerings , users , slant-eyed , broken-toothed and puffy-cheeked because of the lens that makes some critics of the company who are cartoonish these asians &quot; the asian mask &quot; there has been criticism that .
this recurring conflicts indicate a larger problem with the company &apos;s diversity and wondered whether .
news and anger , and spread with the news of motherboard the verge on wednesday , a day after it announced that snapchat removed a feature .
a statement from the company is found in : lens , asians not to be cartoonish , was written in homage to the characters in the anime .
however , observers with the experience of racism for this lens reminded me of the stereotypes hurt .
the comparison of other people if it &apos;s anime in general refused .

this filter mask is the only asian and not asian at the same time degrading at a mask level .
snapchat , cultural is not the only company that exceeds the trigger mechanisms .
american culture , institutions , meeting rooms and all of us from carrying devices in their hands to hollywood in many areas , it is seen that diversity and inclusiveness is about an endless conflict .
snapchat and racial diversity are also more extensive than its other counterparts , the younger audience might expect a higher sensitivity can be interpreted as .
in an interview on thursday , the 25-year-old katie zhu , a humiliating image for a user when you create one of the lenses snapchat , &quot; of such a movement are not as noticeable as it used to be the fact that it is much more difficult , &quot; he said .

ms. zhu , the company terminated the majority of the article criticizing his team of white men with a label : # snapchat .
ms. zhu , who is an american of chinese descent &quot; or because there is sufficient staff or they can make such decisions between a variety of different races working there and are persons who belong to different ethnic groups , although these people doesn &apos;t feel comfortable or safe to talk about themselves strong enough , &quot; he said .
other observers to share their views on snapchat of this complaint is largely left unanswered .
the company , with the status of a private company doesn &apos;t share the figures of highlighting the diversity among the staff .
thursday day , but the staff declined to share the origins of racial snapchat , according to a spokesman for the company internally and inclusion efforts focus on underrepresented populations , adequate a short time ago in order to increase responsible for recruitment has recruited .
ms. zhu , in its own terms , said he would keep it shut snapchat account and added , &quot; i wonder whether that needs more users like us who can say that &apos;s not true . &quot;
congressional panel , military officials , intelligence tampered with that said isid
in a report to be published on the day of thursday , a congressional panel , the united states central command officials in iraq and syria against the islamic state to draw a more optimistic picture of events on the field of battle falsified the intelligence reports had reported .
the house armed services committee , the intelligence committee and defense appropriation subcommittee , which consists of a working arm of a dec report by the republican chairman of the central command of the united forces of the islamic state assessments among intelligence analysts who changed a &quot; widespread dissatisfaction &quot; was found .
also known as centcom , central command , tampa , fla . , is located in a military headquarters that oversees american military operations in the middle east and central asia .
in a news release about the report contained the following statements : &quot; senior centcom intelligence leaders approved by the results of the efforts of the united states is typically more positive than the facts on the ground indicate terrorism prevention and other elements of the intelligence community continuously draws a picture offers much more than the analysis of positive results . &quot;
republican representative ken calvert from california , &quot; just what happened at centcom is unacceptable ; while providing analysis to senior decision makers our troops suffer a bad warrior , &quot; he said .
centcom has just reached the top levels of the organization of the leadership failures .
10-page report , america &apos;s central command is located in the analysis and description of training activities for iraqi forces , gave the details of the persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 .
however , senior obama administration officials gave the order for the revision of the report is proof positive that although not known as isid analysts and daes , providing a perspective on the threat of an islamic state leaders felt more optimistic about pressure from centcom explains that .
the report , &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many central command press release , congressional statements more positive statement , and a remarkable amount of actual events &quot; is called .
for example , a centcom official , publicly mosul as early as april or may 2015 for the retrieval of a large military attack that could be performed in a stated period .
iraq &apos;s second largest city , mosul still is under control of the islamic state .
republican representative mike pompeo of kansas , said in a statement &quot; after months of research it was understood this point quite clearly , &quot; he said .
2014 to mid-2015 until the middle of the central command of the united states of america &apos;s most senior intelligence leaders , iraq &apos;s intelligence for the commander to be launched in isid manipulated the results of the threat as insignificant .
republicans , intelligence analysts have expressed concerns about the islamic state that once consisted of a working arm is manipulated .
as investigations continue , on the day of thursday , the report published much more comprehensive findings will follow .
another review which is being conducted by the inspector general of the department of defense centcom intelligence is also available .
the democratic members of the house intelligence committee thursday on the day of the republican study some conclusions reached by the arm participating in their findings published .
the democratic chairman of the committee , representative adam b. schiff , said in a statement that &quot; between 2014 and 2015 , centcom , the iraqi security forces in intelligence assessments about fire and extremely narrow-minded has established a process , &quot; he said .
mr. schiff according to this process an &quot; intelligence has delayed the publication of results , &quot; among analysts has led to morale , and &quot; has not given enough room to disagree . &quot;
however , mr. schiff , and democrats , the white house centcom analysts said the results were &quot; predetermined or a political lecture &quot; and they put pressure on the fitting expressed in reaching findings .
on the day of the congress the preliminary results of review was announced tuesday by the daily beast .
in the month of last august , the new york times , a pentagon inspector general review that is opened after complaints made by analysts , centcom reported the presence of .
top patrick lieutenant commander evans , a pentagon spokesman , said in a statement that the inspector general &apos;s review of the continuing process of the congress , the department of defense has stated that it would not comment on the report .
however , &quot; experts in some cases , can disagree on the interpretation of complex data , and of the ministry of defense and the intelligence community supports a healthy dialogue about these important national security issues , &quot; he said .
research in iraq and syria american-led bombing it will echo beyond the issue of whether to continue the operation ( this is an argument posed by an authority more defensive with each passing day ) .
however , last year , accusations , president obama has iraq , afghanistan , libya and other crisis points , you could count on for honest reviews the question of military operations to central command revealed .
intelligence that is not reflected criticism of the islamic state , centcom intelligence analyst gregory hooker , in spite of the protests of president george w. bush &apos;s administration , many analysts advocated that they be maintained in iraq with a small force , and in 2003 he wrote an article that says that after the occupation began , and didn &apos;t think enough at the time for over a decade are discussed .
mr. hooker , at the same time on intelligence has played an important role in the rebellion of the islamic state .
mr. hooker of the team last year the authorities , despite their public statements to the contrary , in the possession of the refinery airstrikes against the islamic state to sell oil on the black market since temporary refineries are built , the terrorist group has reached the conclusion that a significant proportion of financial resources did not affect stated .
however , the times noted in the month of september , as this finding it has not spread outside of the central command .
just at that time the commander of centcom , general lloyd j. austin iii last year , a legislator in the senate by many seen as a highly positive assessment the description of the war has been subject to criticism for .
central command general austin in the month of april general joseph l. votel retired and who replaced him in person .

stillness in the middle of the trampoline &apos;s olympic ambitions
wherever you are , no matter what it is , the olympics continues .
competition and events in rio de janeiro , it represents an ambitious work , and it cannot be avoided or it will never end .
itself the the olympic torch relay swimmers , triathletes , gymnasts from there forwarded to a flaming baton .
simone biles , katie ledecky , michael phelps and chad le clos or watch television without hearing something about the conflict between won &apos;t read the newspaper , or in a cafe you &apos;re unable to listen to what your neighbor says .
and logan dooley .
mr. dooley who is competing in the olympics for the first time , sponsorships , and feel-good tv ads preaching wide between a swimmer , a gymnast or a fencer like a heartbeat dimples on the ball , may be one of the names that are shown in prime time hours .
however , in lake forest , california mr. dooley ( 28 ) fighting for gold medal in the olympics is trampoline .
every activity doesn &apos;t light the olympic flame at the same level .
away from the centre , partially in the shadows there are universally unrecognized sports : air rifle shooting , archery , badminton , taekwondo .
breaststroke will be with us always , and hope to be for a very long time .
however , if i have to mention my personal favorite , i would like to draw attention to the hidden magic of the trampoline .
trampoline was introduced as an olympic event since 2000 at the sydney games , how is recognized in the 16 years between when i asked although very few people he didn &apos;t know was that this was an olympic sport .
this may be a regional ignorance .
the united states never won a medal and send athletes for competition trampoline 2012 has been a rising contestant for the finals .
men awards , the chinese and the russians , who tended to share the chinese and the canadians .
rosie maclennan from canada and dong dong from china to their gold medal in london this year he &apos;ll be defending their .
however , trampoline , event stands out as almost innocent ; this is partly unconscious in the ears , it may be considered instead of the clown college that is worthy of the olympics .
i have to admit that i &apos;m not the expert here , just i have an interest in the subject .
funny , there is a potential ( leap never terminated created by cartoon-like such as chills ) , but it &apos;s basically together , the two of which reflects the elegance of the sport is gymnastics and diving .
&quot; trampoline &quot; is the word , the word trampoline comes from the spanish el ; this is &quot; trampoline &quot; is the meaning of .
he jumped almost 30 feet high from the ground , a large trampoline champion candidates before landing on his feet and a series of motion ( burkma , pike and salto ) are being asked to do .
according to the official olympic program , execution , difficulty , and &quot; flight time &quot; are evaluated according to .
in rio from 17 countries and 16 men , 16 women , including thirty-two athletes will compete .
the most common progression is directly next to the olympics .
hoping to get a medal , in their quest for gold , in some cases , to the end point , in some cases , also back and forth , up and down with the movement further , faster and get higher .
they &apos;re not looking for the wall or the finish line just startup , but also broadcast on television in another tough line ; the world set a record or olympic .
the principal of this ambitious effort , and even enviable at extreme levels ; the audience is enough to choke even the tears .
however , this just slightly while watching the games of the features that i find exhausting .
trampoline , allows you to give all of this a dec .
trampolines moves upward .
the goal is not moving in the forward direction .
upward jumps , weightless like an astronaut looking up , down and re-up effortlessly .
of course , competition is not without difficulty either , but working feverishly to achieve a result for the duration of the routine , away do not disappear , they only like the illusion of time and gravity , the suspension in an elegant manner .
how calm is so serene that you can be an olympic race .
and then the women &apos;s finals will be held at 13.00 on friday afternoon eastern time ranking ; men saturday night 13 .
nbc every two days , finals in the afternoon from 14.00 onwards and will release as a block .
in the middle of the olympic madness , quiet and can be ignored in the general rush they promise a wonderful time .

long-time u.s. ally , ethiopia &quot; protest generation &quot;
violent protests in ethiopia
the protesters who demand political change in ethiopia , it encountered violent resistance to the government .
witnesses said that several protesters entered the police says he receives the blows of a deadly weapon in combat .
ethiopia is about to collapse ?
in the past decade , one of africa &apos;s most stable nations with the fastest growing economies and had been a strong ally for the west .
however , in recent months , anti-government protests , shocked the country by spreading to more and more areas every day .
just last week , with thousands taking to the streets by fundamental political change requested .
according to human rights groups , the government &apos;s response was pretty cold .
witnesses , police officers shot and killed a large number of unarmed demonstrators , he said .
the end of last year or this year thought to be from the start of the protest footage , young people who are forced to stand against a wall put your hands up and whipped by security officials seems to .
the united nations human rights official at the top level , now he wants done a detailed review .
research project director rashid abdi of the somali peninsula , which is a group the international crisis group , &quot; keeping this country together has always been difficult and will be more difficult to advance , &quot; he said .
ethiopia is one of the most populous nations in africa , after nigeria and stability are appreciated by the west .
the american military and intelligence services , especially working with ethiopians in the somali region to combat terrorist threats in africa and the west there are very few countries who help so much from conducts .
ethiopia &apos;s economy is growing in an impressive manner .
the engine has been effectively improved ; the capital , addis ababa are available in new in even a commuter train .
and the streets are generally quiet , safe and clean .
although exhibited the best example of how democracy in ethiopia , ( the repressive attitude of the government is constantly referring to human rights groups ) within the country was quite limited opposition , the opposition were effectively silenced .
most exiled , imprisoned , killed or banished to the most remote corners of the desert .
however , this situation may be about to change .
seyoum from ethiopia who is a university lecturer middle techhome &quot; people and strangle them from protest offer another option if you do not , hell one of these events , &quot; he said .
youth completely in protest .
a generation in protest .
by land use pressure on the ruling coalition the power of so many present complaints .
quite in the field of criticism last year after the elections , the ruling party and its allies took the last chair filled out of opponents , and now 100 percent control of parliament .
at the same time , a war that killed hundreds of people in the month of june , which led to sharp tensions on the border with eritrea , and the controversial line , which is also on the rise .
promo analysts liberation front or the ogaden national liberation front separatist groups have disappeared in the turbulence of recent years , such as where , taking advantage of the re-armament he is afraid of .
hurt feelings that boiled under the surface for many years , explains there are several factors that cause that is now imploding .
first innocent looks : smartphones .
internet service is provided as is and cheap smart phones become more prevalent , it only began a few years ago a large number of ethiopian to communicate by using social media .
the government , especially in times of protest closes access to facebook and twitter as i often do , even when they could most people communicate through internet proxy servers that belies their position .
few protests that gathered in this way to the young ethiopian said .
secondly , ethiopia &apos;s two largest ethnic group , has increased the solidarity between hormones and amhara .
normally amhara promos and ally .
for a very long time , predominantly christian from the highlands of ethiopia are muslim amhara policy and most of them out of business , and porn had been abused in the flat-lands .
however , this situation is changing .
an oromo leader mulatu gemechu &quot; we &apos;re moving in the direction of collaborating to gather under one umbrella , &quot; he said .
amhara and oromo regions , the largest protests were seen .
most of the amhara and oromo of ethiopia make up about 6 percent of the population , and the army , the intelligence services , commerce and politics by members of the dominant ethnic group has been unfairly tigranya domina thinks that .
the third reason behind the unrest is met , the death of meles zenawi had been .
the former rebel leader , mr. meles in 2012 , served as prime minister of ethiopia for 17 years until he died from an undisclosed illness .
everyone gets to see who was thought to be a tactical genius .
analysts identify the first signs of unrest , and to appease their opponents and especially his to them , says an expert in the deactivation .
conflict analyst , mr. abdi &quot; the current regime do not have this basic information , &quot; he said .
i hailemaria desalegn ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , was elected to replace mr. meles relatively in limbo .
unlike the tigray region of northern ethiopia meles from mr. mr. i just hailemaria the south .
titrations of analysts controlled that did not win the confidence of the security service says .
as a result , more fear and more blood spilled .
ethiopia &apos;s recent experience in such a mess in 2005 , after his theft of thousands of people protest after the government of a sloppy election analysts .
this is less than each of the following measures over the past months , although many protesters have been killed and also the period of confusion that passed relatively quickly .
development professionals , infrastructure planning and visionary leaders like ethiopia &apos;s new commuter train is praised for significant progress in the fight against poverty .
however , that didn &apos;t stop it was obvious that the increase of hatred against the ethiopian government .
ethnic and and this is becoming dangerous .
last month , an amhara town gondar protesters titrations-owned businesses attacked and tigranya shows the increase in social media hatred .
analysts say the protests he left in a strange state of the united states and other allies in the west , he says .
drone flights over somalia for neighbouring ethiopia , the united states government was using it as a base ; however , this base was closed a short time ago i was told .
the fragmentation of an already fragile region in the west support democracy , the allies clearly he doesn &apos;t want to .
mr. abdi &quot; this , &quot; he said , and added , &quot; it &apos;s like walking on a very thin rope . &quot;

speaking on twitter again , mrs. clinton &apos;s proposal would increase taxes , and he himself noted that his speech found boring .
mr. trump defenses sarcasm i had used before .
towards the end of the month of july , the russians in mrs. clinton &apos;s e-mails , displaying a view that after encountering huge criticism after the pirate attack and advises that these comments &quot; of course i told that in a sarcastic manner by saying , &quot; it explained .
in this approach , mr. trump &apos;s political speech and allows you to push the limits of where she needs to take a step back .
subsequent communications expert ruth sherman , a language that both candidates &quot; by the supporters of this particular message by testing to see how you react , depending on the reaction , in a way , the &quot; description &quot; that allows you to layout , &quot; he said .
but at the same time , these statements when viewed from the different lenses and filter gives uncertain as to knowingly knows that .
recently after the fall in the polls , mr. trump , instead of soften for the audience the mood of the general election adopted a much more aggressive attitude .

however , mr. trump &apos;s subjected to much more scrutiny in the last months of the presidential campaign jokes , reviews , how provocative , although loyal supporters of the public who support him puts you in a difficult position .
former new york city mayor rudolph w. giuliani , as one of mr. trump &apos;s most prominent supporters thursday in an interview with cnn &apos;s day did his best to defend the island .
mrs. clinton and mr. obama established by mr. trump in the direction of the correctness of the thesis about the islamic state when asked the question , mr. giuliani , i think , is making a legitimate political criticism , &quot; he said .
from one perspective , before obama isid unknown , a small organization was those who find them cute was completely wrong , and the withdrawal from iraq was due to soldiers .
most featured republican , mrs. clinton that the state department of the obama administration in coping with the situation in the middle east that failed to cause it to grow in an aggressive manner and trying to argue that isid .

who tried to solve itself &quot; poor , pathetic &quot; television experts scoffed , &quot; they can &apos;t do that ! &quot; he said .

according to the book , at the white house with mrs. roosevelt &apos;s taste who cares nothing about until just now hiring an assistant prepared &quot; food is not the saddest , most dismal dishes prepared in the manner also &quot; began to be offered .
the country re-were on their feet after most of the methods making food in times of crisis has been sidelined .
according to mrs. ziegelman calories and nutrition-oriented understanding and the way science is applied to cooking continues .

huseyin gulerce : 3 feet linked to the gülen collapse crash
huseyin gulerce interprets the coup attempt of feto found striking comments .
explanations of the carriage hussein gulerce follows :
they attempt a coup as it passed from my mind for the last 5-6 months of my writing about this &quot; you can try , but they can &apos;t in the chain of command , &quot; he wrote .
i didn &apos;t know two things ; the first on this scale to be widespread and profound , for example , the 8-year-old adjutant general commander of the gendarmerie and the president &apos;s aide .
mr. president , the people who are struggling the most , who knows how choosing the aide noticed them , but the most important feature of unprecedented privacy .
such a hypocrite .
&quot; this is not a job a retired preacher can do feto , such as the statement &quot; one of the most important evidence of such a deep caliper .
cla is definitely the support it receives .
the cia tried it &apos;s hand too early to the party .
mahmut ovur in the house in 1971 and fetullah gulen says vehbi koç 2014 fuat doğu was discussed .
most of the people of that era who deals with these things as myth and is the closest of relations between the period when the cia says .
armed forces personnel paid the wages of us in the u.s. , after remembering them , so one man got out .
when we are learning how to do this , 2014 .
mahmut brain after this post , the explanation is not to refute it .
for example , the fair orphan , he was caught on ?
who is this wondering if .
the man 2 times in the last 25 days before the coup , went to pennsylvania , returned 2 days ago .
orphan fair since 2002 109 times gone abroad .
when you bring all these things together , i need to investigate that ; right now , all of those who fled fetullah gulen was in the united states , march since 1999 , which ones they went to the united states with an excuse , that need to be investigated .
it will be seen that , on one occasion , they went to pennsylvania .
but the principal contacts with the cla can be found here ; especially for safety that need to be upgraded for the safety of the people that are a lot of people it was sent to the united states .
there is in the wikileaks documents ; joint meetings of this association and association with the cia is doing a smiley lets .
about this there has been studies to show connections with the cia she is legally 15 years ago .
i said fuat avni is an intelligence pool in pennsylvania 2 years ago .
the guy who worked as prime minister fuat avniye the works .
but too bad ; this information at the cia as he fell to pennsylvania fell .
gülen is not linked to the collapse of the collapse of the three pillars ; one is what we call floor , friends , the rings consisted of , thoroughly are the ones in deep hypnosis , this movie is even still say that erdogan &apos;s coup attempt .
as i was saying , three foot , a base support .
questions , burglary , and the right to ash to overcome this , the base rattled a lot of support .
the other two legs ; political support , international support .
international support is still available .
the only thing that will break with the political support of the tape that was taken by the mhp administrator baikal feto documented .
july 15 , after &quot; feto &quot; yu mr. kılıçdaroğlu , too he &apos;s using , everybody &apos;s eyes opened .
smiley is such a poser &quot; i &apos;m not around is my doing , &quot; he says .
next to me says , &quot; hey , hussein bey , this girl is very different from the students they &apos;re dreams , they &apos;re sending me , it &apos;s not correct because the dream i had no longer forbidden to practice with &quot; .
recording sound to record sound in a speaker that had fallen on the barbaros kocakurt : the prophet &apos;s dream teacher my friends tweets , fold it in half .

there were quiet a few low flying aircraft the helicopter around again .
we saw the lights .
the image was probably an unmanned aerial vehicle that can receive .
they were flying in front of the helicopter .
i &apos;ll be there for 11 years , i saw close-up flight for the first time i called to the guardhouse .
then a movement began .
when you are looking at the news , we learned that the bridge was closed .
our general manager at that time , security in on time that non-friends to come into the building he had ordered .
trt broadcasts all packets are dropped when you go to the guardhouse for information that we learned .
trt broadcasts interrupted for 5 minutes .

our manager &apos; trt stop &apos; put in order us the psychology of some resistance .
trt the cut , after a while we heard the sound of the helicopter .
we went outside , the helicopter fired down to the guardhouse everywhere , everyone were scattered to one side .
ran into a building at the rear .
we were 12 people in total .
soldiers descending from a helicopter we came back to the past .
our soldiers captured a few friends .
we also leave them alone to emerge .
at that time they caught us and i saw the assistant general cokturduk the knee .
they were the soldiers talking among themselves .
&apos;up one hit , beware &apos; one said .
then they made all of us sit inside .
commanders &apos; who &apos;s in charge here and i won &apos;t ask again , &apos; shouted .
&apos;one hit &apos; when he heard talk of style , we thought : we don &apos;t have news from home , but an instruction came to us , &apos; stop trt &apos; .
there is a resistance means .
in that moment i felt like i was giving up my own life .
&apos;me , &apos; i said .
i stood not knowing what to do at that moment .
all i can think about at that moment , was that my friends from the helicopter opened fire on the guardhouse .
10-15 guardhouse and friend was killed i thought &apos; they &apos;re going to kill us eventually &apos; collapsed on me in relief when i think .
commander in the beginning &apos; you &apos;re going to cut off all transmissions except trt , &apos; he said .
the monitor when you leave the system partition that we have local channels on satellite .
one local channel broadcast from 80 to 200 we &apos;re going to the room in question .
to this room came to my mind .
among them had no national broadcast .
if i tell you that i cut them and lost all of them , at least until that time with no outside help or income support reaches .
or go on and on i said .
we had come to accept that we couldn &apos;t us out of there eventually .
&apos;i &apos;ll cut all right , &apos; i said .
i cut the antenna of one of the output of the local channel package .
i cut the power button to the monitor that you could watch national channels .
thus , we would write the entire screen in no signal .
i told him i needed to go to the antenna to be completely cut .
the commander sent two soldiers with me to the antenna .
antenna the room i opened one of the soldiers &apos; stay there , &apos; he said .
the gun put it to my forehead .
&apos;you &apos;re going to cut all of them except for the trt , no one you won &apos;t , i &apos;m going to hit one of you eventually , that &apos;ll be you , &apos; he said .
she conveniently no longer in my life to be so much &quot; &quot; all you &apos;ll see will be frozen when you go , &apos; i said , i didn &apos;t say anything else .
we entered the station , loitering local publications .
we have switched to the other antenna .
at that time , close to 20 national system that corresponds to the channel have occurred .
cut approximately 20 local channels when the monitor to no avail .
the lord helped us , and we had tied them both foresight and their difficulty when you answer .
we provide the answers they believed .
he didn &apos;t fight they didn &apos;t .
for us this is a relief .
the transformer replace the antenna after i left they asked .
&apos;i don &apos;t know , i &apos;m a tv broadcaster is , &apos; i said , &apos; do you have an electrician among you &apos; he asked .
&apos;in the evening after work , no electrician if you have problems , come to the team , &apos; i said .
at that time there was actually an electrician .
i remembered i didn &apos;t stop broadcasts from cyprus .
i was thinking of cutting them to keep the troops entertained .
because they think of publications that is cut a bit chilled out .
couldn &apos;t think to look to publications .
now the group went to wait in .
after about an hour in the waiting room when i open the tv and saw a news broadcast .
he went inside , the soldier .
&quot; commander , cut a news release , &apos; he said .
we met the commander &apos;s eyes .
&apos;stand up , &apos; he said .

less educated , ex-footballer erdogan
disrupts this balance , the less-educated ex-footballer with the islamists led by recep tayyip erdogan , which was to a large extent a religious populist entrepreneur , more than a thousand schools , dozens of fetullah gulen from the university of texas to tashkent quran was the winning alliance and institute of education of highly educated followers .
above , in the past week in foreign policy , the translation of the sentence in the article .
erdogan , who are university graduates , less educated and former football player ; it was described as a entrepreneur who graduated from primary school , horizon-wide gulen , gulen &apos;s followers , has been praised in the western press openly of this and similar articles are taking place frequently .
then on the other hand , &quot; why turkey is the united states and / or opposition to the west is rising ? &quot; - themed articles &apos; erdogan ... &apos; he began sentences that they &apos;re trying to offer an explanation .
in turkey , anti-west , erdogan nevzuhur the period of turkey &apos;s history that was unaware of analysts who see it as a situation it is possible to imagine .
in fact , according to statistics , in the first decade of the erdogan era in turkey , or the lack of opposition to the west remains can be read as a period average .
in this decade , the european union and good relations with the united states in synchronize format was maintained .
erdogan &apos;s &apos; one-minute have criticized israel , the massacres of the assad regime in syria on the outbreak of the civil war was the result of the eu &apos;s clear policy to show it is unable to leave the refugee crisis in turkey and for some figures , such as european parliament president schulz of &quot; we are not dealing with erdogan &quot; - shaped ustenci attitude in britain at that time , erdoğan and the mayor of london , opening up a swearing contest , now the minister of foreign affairs of the occurrence of the expression of imagined ugliness inside with a poem wins , in turkey and the pkk from syria from entering the country when a suicide bomber slaughtered dozens of our citizens , the syrian arm of the pkk opened an office in europe with exhibitions by ypg need the glorification syria ypg soldiers who served in the u.s. wear uniforms crest , brett visits of the special representative in charge of combating daes mcgurk ypg special finding that the ypg is not a threat to turkey like all the intelligence and logistical support to opposition groups persistently when left alone ypg shifting , on the other hand , an underestimation of the struggle with turkey &apos;s daes mosul and baghdad and even support us as it is in unity with our number of reducing pressure from the administration , and so there may be many reasons .
come on , we lost people we 247 the result of a bloody coup while our supposed ally , the eu countries and the failure of the coup until proven absence from the united states our democracy is no support for kerry &apos;s first speech about &apos; peace and stability in turkey &apos; they expect to be built , democracy and the elected government having no accent and not forget .
well , charlie hebdo in paris 11 where the employee was killed , he joined the protest of many leaders from around the world including turkey , but the tanks were killed 247 people who resist for democracy even though it has been a month since a coup attempt in turkey &apos; allied &apos; not forgotten how to be a president of any western country ?
several times in a year to incoming presidents or a senior representative of the refugee situation , sent lower-level representatives to send what do we say ?
in case the glass is broken , the daily hurriyet , the ambassador of eu and us go to visit to get all the past , bombed , that is not a solidarity visit to the turkish grand national assembly , however , how do we evaluate ?
when there is a coup in egypt by sending the eu &apos;s senior representative within the first two weeks of the coup , the leader shook hands with the fog , kerry &apos;s visit to post-coup &apos; democracy is being rebuilt by saying , &apos; if it is remembered that the management promotes the blow , the resistance of turkish democracy from western countries who refrain from being in support of turkey &apos;s democracy at every opportunity , they brought their language in turkey , there are not concerned about sincere is that so crazy ?
however , 95 % of the people who gulen is seen as responsible for the coup in the united states even now is enough to drive the turkish people to be allowed to live freely .
if it is added to the above-mentioned background , i think rising west / anti-americanism , it &apos;s clear that erdogan is a condition that cannot be explained by only .
moreover , u.s. influence in the coup , erdogan did not even think that was still ...
so , the crate it &apos;s not a detail never
people who look down on his own , &quot; of the crate is all about the details , &quot; he said , like himself , who don &apos;t think voters are &quot; ignorant scratching his belly as &quot; insulting the trip short , i wonder if they can play the same tune night after 15 july ?
after seeing how the state and the citizens of this democracy , i wonder , &quot; where all we were so wrong &quot; sought to answer the question ?
but there are so many questions that should have the answer to ?
to be a traitor , who until yesterday served in various capacities in and of themselves the officers who will be given the right to use the weapons of the state at a time , how about &quot; traitor &quot; status from foreign states and accepted into they have sought asylum .
skewness is a mental environment in which we live and how people-oriented the behavior that led to obsession , how perversion people we need to see what would be described as .
as for a coup attempt bleary minds ...
those involved in this action of turkey for the cities , the cities of syria to have a perspective beyond compare ?
why an officer of his country &apos;s parliament bombs ?
to expect reasonable behavior from brains feto watered with his curse words , there is a danger that we should have probably not .
the other responsible party , but we just know that it is not only responsible for all of feto .
politics , fighting , and hatred of the profession , and the present staff have made the required contributions to the tragedy of living .
themselves &quot; enlightened &quot; offering as aymaz also , any kind of illegal behavior , have convinced the masses that is natural and even nasty .
those who hate guns in the hands of his own people were given when we saw how they fired these people .
the path of democracy the way we know it
i &apos;m saying a very simple thing : on the evening of july 15 , maker within the soldier in turkey , public feto tufeyli , thieves , martyrs to democracy 250 and to save gave sergerde too dry .
but behind july 15 1992-2002 ; 2002-2012 ; 2012 and after three periods .
there are modifications of these three periods is prepared in three : economic , social , political .
prepared two major phenomena of social change : migration from rural areas to the metropolis , and for a very long period of deployment , transferred after being held in the vicinity of the city .
i pointed out that was on wednesday of this move through the tube .
not saying metro is the most important element of social change because i also stressed .
the second largest change in the same direction , bridges and roads .
the contribution to the modernization of road and the bridge that brings more easily understood .
path income , economic and social structure changes .
we also have the political structure has changed .
this historic spotted along with hyperlinks thrown on the bosphorus in istanbul .
demirel , the bosphorus bridge was built .
after this was the climax of the peasant movement of the 1960s in the 1950s .
ozal , now we change the name of the martyrs bridge in the same direction as the second bridge progress continued to july 15 .
even these routes centre - periphery relationship established between shows .
he is also the course of how social change is a sign that he was being watched .
demirel and özal was the purpose of melting away in the center of large masses .
the center &apos;s policy was to pass them .
the third bridge in as many years , the ak party did .
because migration continued unabated .
people were placed in the satellite cities .
in that area some closed system was created .
as ak party , local government to the people , job , social status gave , they also vote for the ak party .

the organization opened for business across the globe 55 thousand , transfers to the school &apos;s network in the united states that have the largest contract in amsterdam , paid for by american taxpayers millions of dollars each year from taxes given to schools that were reported .

the answers to these questions .
the two types of the venous system of the leg :
1.dirty blood dirty blood to the lungs , which leads to the main legs of the leg of what we call the deep venous system that collects the main road .
the femoral vein the femoral vein , deep and superficial , they take the name of these .

the dirty blood in the groin and legs leading to the lungs combined with the superficial venous system deep venous system , which we call the path side .
this system , which we call the two large and two small veins saphenous vein , consists of .
all four of these vessels insufficiency and varicose veins may develop .
which may be used in heart surgery , the vein , superficial veins called great saphenous vein .
the lack of these vessels is harmful to the body and therefore it can be used in heart surgery .
however , in order to be used in heart surgery blood vessels of these vessels must be healthy .
&apos;your heart is a vital organ .
varicose veins may be surgically removed or be left in place with a laser incineration process reduces the workload and ensures that more of the leg vein is healthy .

spare that heart surgery can be used in vascular systems ; below the sternum , the stomach is located in and around the arm .
therefore , varicose veins , and keep heart waiting for you to use to worry about it is misplaced .

just not the star of the tv show kardashian ; kendall , on the cover of the september edition of vogue
model and the administrator &apos;s mother , kris kardashian-jenner group , the fourth daughter , kendall jenner ( 20 ) , on the cover of the eagerly anticipated september edition of vogue us .
estee lauder is the brand ambassador of milan , paris and new york fashion week kendall , who in triumph , news of the day from instagram account announced this thursday .
kendall &quot; in a room filled with the people i love i cried when i look at this cover , &quot; he wrote .
after the announcement of the lid , all the kardashian-jenner family ( rob and caitlyn at the bar and everyone &apos;s favorite troublemaker from the world of show producer ryan seacrest keeping up uncle weird ) ( or just keeping up with all the program-specific ) , scripted reality , a video was released ; the cover of a classic ending in the video her sister who forget the family later wrote : they were actually planning a surprise party .
almost all children &apos;s television programs each of this &quot; birthday &quot; section of the cliche story line ( though the sincerity of seacrest at 8 a.m. with a cartoon rabbit , &quot; you think we forgot did you ? &quot; he says ) , kris , in a way the other girls included in this promotion .
with this development we have entered a new period of vogue in the september issue of kardashian .
kendall &apos;s sister kim on a date can be passed to her on the cover of vogue ( the cover in april 2014 his wife , he was sharing with kanye west ) , but the september cover of the magazine is an achievement in itself .
the september issue of vogue , was the number of the best selling of the year .
with a thickness reminiscent of a fashion magazine too much from a coffee table book , this number attracted the attention of many advertisers ( fashionista , last year &apos;s 832-page 615 of the skin % it has been found that advertising content ) .
unveiling the cover star is also a process closely monitored ; the pictures of the magazine for the past two years , it was leaked before the official announcement .
among women previously the cover which is placed on naomi campbell , linda evangelista and kate moss in the lobby .
in recent years , on the cover of &quot; famous models &quot; many &quot; model celebrities &quot; are featured in .
oscar-winning dior ambassador jennifer lawrence was featured on the cover in 2013 , this honor next year , lady gaga mentioned .
however , his generation by the magazine as &quot; a shining model &quot; even if mrs. jenner is defined as the previous category to be taken of the environment can be said to be fairly good .
this celebrities , reality show stars or better snapchat a video of famous people or relatives who knows how to attract today &apos;s youth , though it &apos;s not ( jenner all of them ) .
all of this is the ability of legitimate prominent women in the entertainment industry .
beyonce on the cover last year , lemonade with the output of one of the best times of his career .
of course everyone is not satisfied with the success of jenner .
because of history , reality show , jenner always will be annoying the location in the fashion world .
in the month of june , the original victoria &apos;s secret model stephanie seymour , criticizing jenner and gigi hadid his colleague called them &quot; slut time &quot; .
jenner appeared on the cover of vogue when this idea surfaced again with the news that she would be .
however , the focus seems misplaced dissatisfaction .
kendall jenner , on the cover of the september edition of vogue .
literally a super model itself .
marc jacobs himself is going to the fashion show .
estee lauder foundation is having you .
herself , her sisters selling their paintings along with your payment in walled applications .
love the pictures of cindy crawford &apos;s daughter is selling magazine who was taking pictures .
and in his spare time , maybe just to see sister kourtney and her kids is taking part in a reality show on television .

the control entity of the fund discussed the re-commission
the funds are expected to be among the world &apos;s largest turkey , which is the entity of the law over the objections of the fund was removed from the bag quietly .
due to the lack of an audit mechanism of the fund , it was decided to review it again before the commission was discussed but no changes are made in .
entity fund legislation that brought the akp , turkey sozcu.com.tr &apos;ye on the utku cakirozer to rate the planning and budget commission chp deputy and a member of the &quot; employees of publicly owned assets to be taken from worker pension cuts , the necessity for the unemployed unemployment funds collected will consist of the structure that we are strictly against to be excluded from constitutional control mechanisms , &quot; he said .
turkey &apos;s investments and projects prepared to provide long term funding for the government entity to fund the bill , the opposition was removed from the opinion that the law should also be discussed tuesday day bag .
however , the akp has once again been brought to the commission budget plan and offer the same way today .
utku cakirozer a member of the parliamentary planning and budget commission chp eskişehir deputy , anxiety and concerns about the law the chp fund asset bid sozcu.com.tr &apos;ye told me .
cakirozer , &quot; the establishment of this fund in the omnibus bill when it comes to the planning and budget commission chp former finance minister zekeriya temizel , who was the head of the delegation , expressed his concerns and our concerns , also discussed in detail the law of offer to be proposed to be removed from this bag . &quot;
we accept this view that the government withdrew the bill .
the bill came to the commission yesterday again the same way .
&quot; the government seems to insist on the removal from the assembly within a week , &quot; he said .
the emergence of a consensus about the law that must be cakirozer asset fund stating , &quot; our biggest concern us in this bill , uh . &quot;
&quot; publicly owned assets that are to be taken from the labourers the necessity of pension cuts to employees , the unemployed collected unemployment for the fund will come from the revenues from privatisation , the parliament and the court of auditors does not have any responsibility outside of the control of dirty and a structure that is being transferred .
the establishment of such funds in russia , china and gulf countries oil revenues and the surplus from trade is financed in this way indicating that the funds cakirozer , &quot; however , the savings deficit in the us . &quot;
so , from public sources of funding will consist of the public &apos;s money .
the unemployment fund will total 100 billion , 100 billion of private pension funds to employees is made with privatisation transferred money is scheduled to be 50 billion .
&quot; so that will occur completely on the public &apos;s dime fund , and this money should be spent irresponsibly is not necessarily to be in public control , &quot; he said .
where state resources are gathered , the borrowing state-owned assets shown in keeping the collateral of a fund outside the control of the council , emphasizing that it is unacceptable cakirozer , the asset fund law concerns and concerns about the proposal explained :
this is a big public presence of the collection , expenditure , and business processes relating to borclanilm on behalf of the public , independent auditing cannot be solved with only the control of the company .
you need a transparent structure and not necessarily having control of the public .
the law proposal in , the entity &apos;s constitutional provisions on control and transparency by the authorities of the fund .
a limitation on how much resources to be transferred have not been met .
these funds are used to account for how he could ask no one .
as for the financing of large projects the objective of the fund is credited .
you don &apos;t need to establish a fund outside the budget for it unsupervised .
why don &apos;t we get into the budget ?
when that happens , naturally our minds , &quot; why is the move from the control of the court of auditors and parliament ? &quot; the question comes &quot; .
the money accumulated in the investments of the fund assets being transferred to they are not against , but non-transparent , unaccountable mechanisms are made stating that they are against the fact that cakirozer continued : &quot; there is a need for such a fund can &apos;t be discussed . &quot;
but if the government insist on it , then such investment funds in other countries is the establishment of international standards in turkey , we have to ensure that current current .
control and accountability mechanisms should be structured in a way that was necessarily brought .
there will not be signs on , the citizen will have to account for every penny of his own money in a way that the account must be set up .
the entity of the law received by the commission in the proposal of the fund , underlining that they are absolutely opposed cakirozer , &quot; the akp , especially after the july 15 coup attempt in the assembly that are listening to our criticism , we &apos;re glad . &quot;
in this proposal the akp &apos;s constructive criticism i hope it will give our ear .
rules to be used as national assets , transfer , despite the lack of public control and those who use it is irresponsible .
&quot; the requested entity is the fund , however , may be useful if these concerns are resolved , &quot; he said .
incoming law upon the proposal of the akp and the opposition were made to work for achieving consensus between reported .

nasa climate model : venus was once suitable for you to live
the new nasa climate models according to the predictions there were not suitable conditions for life on venus .
scientists at the nasa goddard institute for space studies , climate scientists use a model to explore the history of venus by using the same tools and algorithms developed .
model , venus , warm , water-free surface with the atmosphere of a world filled with co2 and a host of similar conditions that was designed to determine whether .
scientists , in the past , low rotational speed with a layer of thick atmosphere of venus was explaining .
however , the most recent estimates of venus is thin , and suggests that it could have an atmosphere like earth could still go slowly .
the model also ex-looked at the topography of venus .
although present in the dry zone more from the planet earth , once with sufficient water to protect against rapid evaporation and geographic variability may have had .
old venus , a dim sun at a rate 30 percent more at the same time to benefit from .
giss scientist anthony del genio , in a news release , &quot; the slow return of venus in the giss model simulation every time for almost two months , it would allow to be pointed at the sun by day , &quot; he said .
this also acts as an umbrella that protects against solar warming of the surface by heating the surface layers , forming a thick cloud that was turning into rain .
as a result , in the world today , since it is exposed to temperatures only a few degrees colder average climate .
model , planetary scientists suggested evolution as a hypothesis for venus is similar to a story that has helped create .
every once conditions suitable for life , although venus for a few billion years , and ultraviolet light was exposed to too much heat .
the oceans evaporated and the water vapor with ultraviolet ray was destroyed by fire .
run out of hydrogen and carbon dioxide to the greenhouse effect of a thick atmosphere filled with only deadly ; it was so today we know it as venus .
new venus climate researchers shared the results of the model articles in geophysical research .

kepler in the constellation of the pleiades stars , measured the speed of rotation of
the kepler space telescope , astronomers in the constellation of the pleiades stars with the last task in terms of the rotational speed of the most complete catalog helped to create .
new data astronomers why are stars in the constellation rotates at a variable speed and rotation period of a planet to an understanding of the formation helps to arrange .
the infrared processing and analysis center , caltech in pasadena , who is a research scientist at to luisa , redbull , in a news release , &quot; our results compared with the star clusters a star mass , age , and we hope to learn even more about the relationship between the history of the solar system , &quot; he said .
the constellation pleiades 445 light years away from earth .
125 million years ago most of the stars in the constellation was formed , and the adult reaches the new level .
throughout their lives , are rotating at the highest possible speed .
the peak rotational speed of stars in the stellar wind in this maturation stage , a large amount .
these winds in the magnetic field of the star as it progresses , the effect of refraction on the stars constitute .
as stars get older , the rate of return begins to fall .
kepler , the speed of rotation of each star is noticeable by monitoring the time between the appearance of bright spots sun spots measures .
the last catalog the speeds of rotation , that rotates faster than smaller stars , larger stars suggests .
redbull , by associating with the stars dancer on one leg for a return of the great ones the small ones carried out in a manner slower than stated .
redbull , &quot; pleiades &apos; ballet &apos; returnees are much more slow heavy fast , so light to the stars , we see the returnees , &quot; he said . &quot;
the constellation pleiades is very close to a star because the rotational speed serves as a cosmic laboratory for the comparison of the ideal with the features .
redbull &quot; the return of the pleiades constellation of stars in both directions as provides theoretical models for young and old , &quot; he said .
the rotational speed of the stars of how , when , and why it fell , the expression &apos; dancing shoes &apos; we want to know about why there &apos;s so much left in a corner .
redbull and colleagues about the constellation pleiades , the most recent analysis of the speed of rotation that will be published in the journal of astronomy in a short time the new article is explained in detail in three .
