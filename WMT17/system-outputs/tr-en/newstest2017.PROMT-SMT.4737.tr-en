british doctors &apos; association ( bma ) doctors committee ( jt ) , assistant general support to the council called for more from the beginning of september that slowing down .
the ministers expressed concerns about the contract , jt can &apos;t do what .
doctors and medical students , an assistant with the bma voted to reject the contract agreement .
this was rejected by 58 % of members who voted for .
in an article published on twitter on thursday night , which is why jt president ellen mccourt , the government &apos;s &quot; persistently silent &quot; about problems of the contract was turned down yet , he said .

russia and turkey : a &apos;uyumsuzlar ittifakı &apos; do ?
this was a gesture sonlandıran crisis .
the leaders of russia and turkey , on tuesday as the economic sanctions and shake hands with words and pictures of the war came together to announce was eight months .
however , st. vladimir putin . while his counterpart in st. petersburg &apos;s palace , who tops the turkish side , this settlement sheikh-y hello-o-o clearly i had the impression that ankara .
el by shaking , yes .
but mr. putin &apos;s smile was relatively weak and even against his own limited standards didn &apos;t spread any temperature .
recep tayyip erdogan , unlike so many times , mr. putin , told &quot; good friend &quot; five times , according to a report .
i &apos;m surprised the number of me .
he &apos;s also much higher levels will reach crisis level of relations with russia , he doesn &apos;t come back before he &apos;s given his word .
the next day , in a newspaper here , mr. erdogan &apos;s statement was never a bad thing pretending .
i think he was showing the exact opposite of that excitement .
but mr. putin &apos;s russia gave the impression of the leader of the cold , you don &apos;t forget anything around it .
in fact , why was the first thing mentioned in the opening of the crisis in a statement : turkey shot down russian war plane in the syrian border .
then russia &apos;s reaction was full of rage .
mr. putin , moscow accused ankara to stab in the back by a hard exit .
resentment was thought to have been friends , was much bigger than the other side .
rebuilding trust will be really hard , maybe impossible .
the idea of the people of russia changed since november .
state-controlled media , and aggressively targeted ankara traumatic for months .
suddenly everything was guilty , the turks .
these are the most serious , high-level officials from the so-called islamic state in syria , mr. erdogan &apos;s family held in the areas under the control of that profit from illegal oil trade was allegations .
he denied that for sure .
but st. the official message from st. petersburg , was in the direction it &apos;s time to move on .
the reason for that to happen in the end of this meeting , mr. putin , president erdogan demanded an apology was being taken .
russia can see it as a kind of victory .
ankara will call for a ceasefire is very clear benefits .
first , erdogan will be held last month after the coup failed and almost overturning needs friends in .
the repeated terror attacks in turkey affected her quite in .
economic reasons and effective .
the sanctions hit russia hard ; turkey &apos;s coastal regions , especially a few million flights carrying russian tourists every year ban on special .
that number fell by almost 90 % .
flights and rental companies in russia and tour operators will continue to be a totally relaxed .
relying on the intensity of the end of the season in the mediterranean .
and this week , state tv , allowing turkish agricultural products will be a decrease in prices of fruit and vegetables with new imports predicted .
a story in the newspaper vedemosti alıntı yapacak olursak &quot; tourists there , tomatoes , over here . &quot;
but there was a separate political value of the visit to moscow .
ankara , the coup attempt didn &apos;t get angry enough for the reaction to the west .
the speed of progress in talks about joining the united states for a long time , when you add in anger sea-snails heard without severing ties with turkey &apos;s western glaciosity between mr. putin and trying to take advantage of coming on line .
russian leader called for support due to the elected officials in ankara after the coup attempt , certainly seems to have packed sympathy .
a radical regime change , he should not fear that this is an attitude to moscow was carrying on .
this summit , held in the palace on the edge of the sea , russia and turkey analyst this sheikh-y explained to me in a way represent a &quot; alliance of misfits &quot; : two bad behavior of the west country and rejected joining forces .
still , despite the appearance of the reconciliation of each other , it &apos;s quite different .
one of the most important of these about syria : moscow russia and turkey support different sides to show himself as a mediator .
almost three hours after the talks , not mentioned in the first two of the president &apos;s press conference to say that supports it .
to answer a question about turkey &apos;s president , these differences , mr putin chose to draw clear holdeth under all of this .
the floor with a clear idea how or where they are choosing a partner in syria .
but the ongoing conflict - and , frankly , for months after the russian war plane hit the nato member turkey has emerged as a potential disaster in the drop in front of the two leaders to start talking - at least it &apos;s definitely a good development .

the bank , rp became a global brand himself as he became a global brand .

people are a little bit different in each of these brands , and our staff and customers that brands will step forward in a way to work under the name .
rp six nations championship , and raise the profile of different brands about sponsorship in sport was sponsored by don &apos;t want to be explained .
the president &apos;s executive board , &quot; no more brands bank understanding geçme our time has come because ( we keep asking ourselves ) that a better bank for customers , how can we do ? &quot; he said .
three years ago and we will be a great bank for our customers that if we made it clear that we offer that i &apos;d find alayvar the brands .
we &apos;re conducting our own work , but not too many changes with our focus on customers &apos; needs and i think you &apos;ll find .
that &apos;s why we can get from this new brands , i think this is a good time .

the reason it &apos;s huge 222 metres long , viaduct , almost 6,000 tonnes in weight that you and that he had about 3 % in the troop withdrawal .
if the team to follow the values of tolerance and sensitive is the reason why it was very low ; only a few millimeters on both sides .

for the health and happiness , a valuable kind of hunting pokémon go
really amazing to see how the world has changed .
young people and children now prefer to spend their free time staring at screens outside to play for the past decade , most people don &apos;t worry , it was a sad situation .
pokemon go and encouraging people to move from the couch .
while limited in time and time spent staring at screens , tv on smartphones , and at the end of the video games as yayıldı .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s not mutually exclusive elements to move in the open air , technology and really great to see .
of course created for video games in the first place in the &apos; 90s ( later turned into products and the other hand , the series cards ) with an app based on characters from pokémon go , i &apos;m talking about .
this new phenomenon , like a lot of popular culture in the game in the united states , australia and new zealand in early july when he was a mess .
later in the intense interest in other countries , why overload the servers due to delayed presentation .
within days , and almost the same number of pokémon go users on twitter with more than tinder has arrived .
so how does it work ?
in short , smart phones , if necessary to explain the way to go looking for pokémon players with gps tracking and finding &quot; draw a picture of &quot; or &quot; catch &quot; ( on the phone with a screen grab ) them .
the game based on the couch , who played a younger generation joined in the search for this madness .
a game in the united states , &quot; average &quot; number of people every day i made a significant increase in the name .
the apple watch app developed for the user with a short while ago to the washington post and 35,000 cardiogram , watching the game between the two days after the presentation of the people who exercise every day in 30 days following rate is 45 per cent to 53 per cent rise , he said .
the company , don &apos;t know who was playing pokémon go only at the level of exercise can see the raw data .
&quot; 30 minutes to spare the time , &quot; people &quot; get off the couch &quot; and &quot; to be active every day , &quot; a lot of public health campaign encouraging the public health message , it seems to be passed on by most people ignored due to be boring and miserable .
but it doesn &apos;t matter how much exercise a little overstated .
people who exercise regularly , reducing the chance of cancer or depression .
exercise , weight control and provides help on issues such as diabetes , high blood pressure and not be listed here has a long list of advantages .
however , pokémon go &apos;s beauty is out for people to do something they enjoy .
three key elements in health is in this way : move , clean air and sunshine and fun .
even during the hunt for some people can learn a new friend .
as usual , looking for something to complain about lmpudent welshers available .
and , of course , someone might hit while walking to the door .
what &apos;s the difference ?
a great innovation has been offered .
our smart phone applications like feet and watch this game offered a reason to exercise like us .
in the use of influence and innovation will be reduced over time .
however , due to the success of pokémon in the real world applications through virtual reality and more active , fit and healthy people out hunting activities with the help that happen to be a lot of the game .

simone , gabby and why we need to laurie
this year &apos;s women &apos;s olympic gymnastics team and there &apos;s more than one reason that i put that name .
first , i joined the united states for the summer olympics since 1984 and all that wasn &apos;t as dominant as ever before .
second : this team , different ethnic roots , to get a lot of girls have inspired child three gymnast owner : &quot; laurie &quot; simone biles , gabby douglas and lauren hernandez .
aly rais and madison koci team brought together by a catholic , jewish people do it proud .
the team at the end of a similar view , america is .
in the same time reinforcing in the presence of black and hispanic women shown in the highest levels of this sport .
the first woman in the past four years , it was always an american gymnast african origin .
last year , and gabby , simone was ranked 1 and 2 .
this is a powerful thing .
in the last olympics , america was a surprise olympic champion gabby douglas and supported him .
now the world champion simone biles , douglas , laurie hernandez and three world of gymnastics routines may have witnessed an extraordinary performance of the unexpected but ingenious .
on thursday , the fourth consecutive gold medal winner in the overall assessment , simone became american women .
and teammate aly rais won silver medals .
this is the best times of the sport , but we don &apos;t look that &apos;s the case throughout the country diagnosis courses in gymnastics .
simone , aly and laurie and gabby , olympic teams to get the same way in madison and watched .
&quot; the last five , &quot; why they &apos;re only four in the next olympic gymnastics team , and marta karol will be the last year that would be a gymnast &apos;s coach .
but really quite an expensive sport of gymnastics and parents , education , travel , hotel fees , uniform payseems gymnasts competition ( for families , coaches and gymnasts ) supported by private gym and a lot of wage work in the clubs .
it &apos;s a lot of these businesses can desteleyenlerin gymnastics clubs , taking part in wealthy suburban neighborhoods .
the only place for families , these clubs can get something gymnasts education requires a long-term commitment and something gymnasts and costly .
simone biles &apos;s coach aimee boorman gymnastics coach maggie haney , laurie hernandez and athletes in training since they started that day .
simone , gabby and countless more affordable and accessible to communities affected by laurie for a young girl we don &apos;t allow gymnastics training .
i started my own gymnastics foundation 20 years ago .
in the city of 15,000 , in my organisations based in harlem as a young man on a free and low-cost gym training we offered ( first of all black and hispanic ) and we coached both national and international to the champions .
in september and young people who deserve the opportunity to take advantage of it , it &apos;s great to learn gymnastics olympic sporunu quality education , we will expand to detroit to present ( where i grew up ) .
the body and mental strength , flexibility and coordination , gym , hard work , discipline and determination can develop in terms of features .
this combination of long-term benefits in terms of success in business school , health , and presents .
this team would be an inspiration to thousands of young girl , who will lead to the gym , and it &apos;s a great thing .
it &apos;s very important for participation in sports activities , especially girls .
it &apos;s really exciting times we &apos;re going through .
simone , aly , laurie , gabby and the olympic team gold medal to madison as &quot; the power of the girls &quot; by bringing back a lot of young girls have different plans and they showed a young woman to be healthy , strong and successful direction thanks to their motivation .

vinyl destination : who really buy records ?
love vinyl , middle-aged men alone .
under the pseudonym tümyalnızortayaşlıerkekleröyledeğil muhteşem insults in the comment section to make this statement is based on the facts before you go , let us sing .
according to yougov , a physical object has created a lot of talk about records going back to last about innovation , not a result of the y generation nostalgia in middle age .
vinyl album recently purchased mostly between the ages of 45 and 54 .
in fact , the most unlikely 18-24 age group .
it &apos;s not just in the same time , collecting and action enthusiasts ; an emotional significance ; old vinyl buyers , likes to hide your feelings to yourself more often ( 56 % and 53 % ) and the joy of being alone ( 69 % and 66 % ) people .
yougov &apos;s results and , right ?
a report published on this blog , tv cameras were on a crowded street in soho , a gray suit , walking with a modest gesture before and after opening , while performing and keep my hands used to watch something like this authoritarian said : &quot; let &apos;s take a look at that time . &quot;
then , let &apos;s take a look .
the centre of soho while slowly lose the magic and unusual ( once upon a time when independent dealers are now filled with buildings , hotels and paperchases eats , pretensa ) is still a few specialist record store .
for the next part of a camera , i &apos;d probably want him to stop the men standing near some of those stores in different ages and i was trying to make information through observation about emotional situations .
sister ray ( census data : three middle-aged men , two young women ) to reckless records ( census data : a woman , probably eight middle-aged man in his 20s ) ettiğim glaswegian stuart ( 55 ) , followed a meeting in london and spend the afternoon for a few hours browsing the shops to fill empty .
i &apos;m asking for a collector .
&quot; i think i am , &quot; he says .
i have about 3,000 or 4,000 record .
official records that will take place in up ( official emailed me , i didn &apos;t follow him sent home ) adorns the walls of the living room .
this is partly why the collection , single and album in as many as a result of disposable income ; now they were young and broke records when he first came back in time and money can buy can &apos;t afford .
&quot; the most of the things i &apos;m the &apos; 60s the &apos; 70s stuff that comes out at the age of 11 or 12 , i &apos;d rather head ; what i &apos;m too young to have , &quot; he says .
areas likely to be introverted people who like being alone , buying a record high and agree with the idea that , he adds : &quot; i don &apos;t smoke , i don &apos;t take too much alcohol .
that &apos;s my bad habit .
sister ray ( 25 ) and fits the profile of clients who works at many of them think weze evermet yougov .
but he had formed a new wave , the hype in the media , fashion is affected by this coming back , you need to buy back old records of people who have noticed it .
i did in 1998 or 1999 people in normal collections görüşmelerde , elinden çıkardığını anladım .
before buying cds for selling cds for customers to buy back vin selling records anymore , &quot; he says .
this is a certain age who can explain an increase in people &apos;s vinyl again .
what about those alleged emotional matter ?
in a shop in stores like the phone records similar to a few seconds to realize that it &apos;ll be a comfort of a group of people buying it .
some older customers , according to students , especially offended weze payment system .
memories of new vinyl fans , some of the digital world overwhelmed calm and stability , he may want to take refuge in familiar cap record of youth .
weze says ; &quot; sometimes that &apos;s why things can be seen as a kind of comfort or material to fill the void . &quot;
i &apos;ve got this , and a lot of people that i &apos;m a collector myself , i think it &apos;s in .
this is an easy way to fill your head .
a study out of a mountain of records &quot; social workers we &apos;re like &quot; friend says .
a poll conducted in april , 50 % of the areas of the vinyl album last month revealed that you don &apos;t listen to the album yet .
in the same time , the survey , 41 % and 7 per cent of a pickup truck and never use that wasn &apos;t even buy vinyl record player emerged .
you know , probably through a series of bossa nova tune at this stage extremely worried when i &apos;d put on a view .
back in the direction this sounds of universe &quot; reward &quot; ( census data : three middle-aged man ) who has been spotted by an element of jonny ( 42 ) .
&quot; someone recently came to me and said : &quot; record player , i don &apos;t have to put the record , but i want to buy a radiohead shelf &quot; &quot; he said .
it &apos;s a big percentage reflects the current situation is definitely not represented .
more product , less music .
there are people who said : &quot; i don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
these are the elderly , young people , not those who enter new to the point is that , in his mid to late teens .
now almost an entire floor of the fop extrapate vinyl for the mass when i got to see that i &apos;m pretty variable .
tourists taking pictures in the seventies , middle-aged women , boys and young couples there .
the atmosphere of the above mentioned stores ( part of the end of the wild beast ) from the speakers if , instead of jazz and pop sex less chilloot sakinleştirici yayılıyor between customers in good to see diversity .
but none of them for long periods of time alone with someone doesn &apos;t seem particularly bothered by 30 seconds to analyze psychological trauma .
elano , on sale for a few minutes walking around in fop ( 27 ) and reviewing records .
instead of spending only went to go window-shopping .
he says he didn &apos;t do much of his record collection isn &apos;t an option .
too much cost .
a computer or in other ways , but it &apos;s easier to listen to music that vinyl beauty . &quot; with a sigh like a lovesick uzaklaşıyor .
i don &apos;t know how to explain it , really unique .

nobody &apos;s looking . maybe it &apos;s because these are just for decoration , some as high as the touch .
this is &quot; an artistic vinyl . &quot;
the wonder of this stuff , but the industry could mean less customer and make more money to send derinliklerine soho ; to complain about much else .
more than a demographic group , which has a lot of time and money to spend more money , it &apos;s not surprising more luxury items like vinyl .
yougov &apos;s findings , but i &apos;m at least in the right shows the results of soho record shops . in reality , with more than a woman found in vinyl record collectors and enthusiasts in stores or online forums , they don &apos;t take into account .
these individuals , or in the office in muhtemelen okul has been working hard .

maybe it is believed that a lot of great britain not to wear a gold medal can at least one britannians comfort thinking about tomorrow : fiji coach ben ryan , from wimbledon , the head of english .
this was a pretty tough journey for great britain .
eight years ago , when they lost every game with ryan in the championship adelaide sevens .
this time , they lost only one .
it &apos;s really hurtful if progress shown in the rout was astounding .
fiji , charming , great britain , made a start to the ball deflected off players through initiatives like it .

jerry tuwul is , right wing of the fourth minute with another curve ball came across .
if they couldn &apos;t touch the ball where it was 12 0 and great britain in the game more .
leone nakarawa to mitchell &apos;s great , but it &apos;s just a third of the intervention prevented what happened to delay the number of fiji .

norton , from the left corner to score a try for great britain has been found and tried to do if the fans of game 36 7 singing , dancing and waving the flag in the south sea the island in hand .

the first move after helen glover and heather stanning , until the last one &apos;s breath in 220 punishment estacio won gold at lago at the moment , when they realized he could be more meaningful .
as much as two people who have had three voices on the boat oars . this kind of a pair of women in the race this year in england to back-to-back olympic medals as the first women to reach their second gold in the process was sound in a boat s-sounds ilerlediği trainers of robin williams .
handlers oldukça açıktı ; it &apos;s their unprecedented series of invincibility was 39 , the race .
we in this image on the surface we see two great athletes soaring swan elegance and does not reflect the precise nature of victory .
this difference that incremental gains , gold medal in every shovel back to 30 months ago , a battalion of hands and have no hand in the coaches who don &apos;t know if he survives long enough to this day was diagnosed with cancer , was not as effective .
they touched as he said , and they &apos;re gone .
i got caught , and they did this type of bladder cancer surgery to intervene .
if they don &apos;t do that , it goes everywhere .
this would be a pretty bad situation .
it &apos;s a little bit , changing your perspective on life .
williams was diagnosed in december 2013 .
in early 2014 , in the off-season , he could start treatment for a three-way in situations like this would be an accurate statement was very lucky , you never know what it &apos;s the only way to minimise distraction land .
that &apos;s why i was supposed to take to recover as fast as i had to pay .

this is what that means to me and helen , once again how hard he works for me and robin vurguluyor .
helen and robin and great , i spent three years .
that &apos;s why we wouldn &apos;t be robin we weren &apos;t the world &apos;s best coach i want to thank him for being the biggest .
a better person to work or i wouldn &apos;t have a better coach .
helen glover and heather stanning lost the race for five years .
in a difficult situation can bilateral , opponents have rhythm .
new zealand and denmark closed stanning and glover &apos;s power teams in the last 500 meters herwhatever genius had fallen out of yet .
that moment , we lost ourselves .
watch helen izle &apos; process , called the process .
it &apos;s really important not to go in .
we had a good start and we weren &apos;t trying to do something incredible .
we weren &apos;t expecting the fireworks to start today , we just want to win the race row when we were good that we did that .

isis intelligence , military officials told congressional panels defaced it .
in a report published on thursday , a congressional panel , the united states central command officials of the war against the islamic state in iraq and syria , to paint a more optimistic about the events in the field of intelligence reports bildirdi defaced it .
the palace defence and intelligence committee , republican of the subcommittee on appropriations , armed services committee , a study by the heads of islamic state forces , a report by the arm of his superiors oluşturduğu report saying that he changed his assessment of the united states central command identified &quot; widespread dissatisfaction &quot; among intelligence analysts .
tampa , centcom central command , known as the american military operations in the middle east and central asia , which oversees fla . &apos; da bulunan and a military headquarters .
these statements took place in a news bulletin about the report : &quot; senior centcom leaders validated by intelligence results , typically of the united states terror prevention efforts of the facts show that a more positive drawing and the intelligence community to provide more positive results from other staff oluşturduğu analysis . &quot;
california republican representative ken calvert , &quot; centcom , what happens in unacceptable ; while our combat troops will be a bad analysis draws high-level decision-makers , &quot; he said .
he &apos;s reached the highest levels of the failures of leadership in centcom .
iraqi forces efforts to provide education in america , central command reported 10 pages of analysis and explanation took place in the details of the permanent problems in 2014-2015 , in order .
however , reports that senior obama administration officials gave signs of change orders for isis and daesh , also known as an optimistic view of the threat of islamic state has created more pressure from centcom leaders felt we should present are described .
&quot; the report in the first half of 2015 , a lot of central command press release , statements , and in congressional testimony was more positive operational incinmişizdir significant rate &quot; is called .
for example. a centcom official to take back mosul , as public as early as april or may 2015 during a major military strike expressed it can be done .
the islamic state of iraq &apos;s second largest city of mosul , still is under control .
representative mike pompeo , republican of kansas in a statement &quot; months of research and then it &apos;s very clear that it is understood that the issue , &quot; he said .
the united states central command from the middle of 2014 until mid - 2015 , the threat posed by isis in iraq &apos;s most senior intelligence leaders to manipulate the results of the intelligence he has to be regarded as insignificant .
intelligence analysts about the islamic state , republicans voiced concern over the arm after a study alleging manipilated getirdiğini has learned .
the findings , published on thursday as investigations continue , more comprehensive report will follow .
the ministry of defence , another centcom intelligence review by the inspector general who carried out on the present .
house democratic members of the intelligence committee released its own findings on thursday when his arm and some who attended the republican study results .
the committee &apos;s democratic chairman representative adam b. schiff , a statement &quot; in 2014-2015 yılları arasında centcom , daesh and iraqi security forces of the intelligence assessment in a process they created extremely insular , &quot; he said .
this process , &quot; intelligence has delayed publication of results , &quot; mr. schiff , according to analysts and opened up between the moral disorder &quot; opposite views did not place enough . &quot;
but the results of the white house and democrats , mr. schiff , the centcom analysts &quot; predetermined or political about a &quot; fiction about apply that pressure they reach a finding that expressed .
preliminary examination by the daily beast on tuesday the state has been acknowledged .
last august , after complaints made by centcom analysts in new york times , a pentagon inspector general confirmed that the current examination .
on a pentagon spokesman lieutenant commander patrick evans , in a statement the ministry of defence in the process , as congress continues to analyze the inspector general report expressed no judgey-ness .
however , his own &quot; experts in some cases , complicated data interpretation at odds over fall and intelligence community and national security issues as important that the ministry of defense supports dialogue about healthy , &quot; he said .
research , led by the united states bombing operation in iraq and syria , and it will resonate beyond the question that he didn &apos;t go ahead and ( that is posed by a defence official said more every day are arguments ) .
but the charges last year , president obama &apos;s military operations in iraq , afghanistan , libya and other crisis points to the question of how he can count on central command for honest assessments it uncovered .
islamic state intelligence , centcom intelligence analyst gregory hooker &apos;s criticism that help you tell , president george w. koetzle many analysts in the bush administration &apos;s iraq invasion in 2003 after a small force to defend against medical advice , and that means you don &apos;t think enough possession when he wrote an article for more than a decade and is now being discussed .
islamic state in the same time , mr. hooker , with intelligence , has played an important role in the rebellion .
authorities last year , mr. hooker &apos;s team in the opposite direction to the air strikes against islamic state , despite public statements on the black market to sell oil to refineries in possession of refineries built temporary financial resources , they are affected by significant ulaştığını stated that the outcome of the terrorist group .
however , evidence of the times stated in september that she didn &apos;t get out of central command .
then the commander of centcom , general lloyd j. austin iii , a lot of explanation in the senate last year by the end of the war is seen as a positive assessment to judge would have been exposed to criticism .
general austin retired in april , central command general joseph l. and his replacement votel .

ortasında trampolini serenity olympic ambition
wherever you are , no matter the time , the olympics continues .
events in rio de janeiro , and it &apos;s like a competition full of ambition or unavoidable represent and work like never ending .
from there , the olympic flame from a flaming baton as he delivered triathlon gymnast swimmer .
katie ledecky , simone biles or michael phelps and chad le clos , can &apos;t watch tv , you don &apos;t hear anything about the rivalry between the neighbours can &apos;t read the paper or a coffee shop you can &apos;t pay attention to what he said .
logan dooley , and there .
participating in the olympics for the first time mr. dooley , sponsorships and tv commercials , a swimmer or gymnast adeta recommended make you feel good in a heartbeat , the dimples like a fencer in the early hours of prime time could be one of their names .
lake forest , california , however , mr dooley ( 28 ) fighting for a gold medal on the trampoline in the olympics .
every event doesn &apos;t light the olympic flame in equal measure .
there are not recognized as a universal in the shadows , away from the centre , partly in sports : the shooting , archery , badminton , taekwondo air rifle .
long may it be and always will be with us , the breaststroke .
but personally , i don &apos;t say i love the trampoline i would like to draw attention to the secret , if necessary .
as much as an olympic event since 2000 where trampolini sidnev games known as the very few people in 16 years between when i asked if it didn &apos;t realize it was an olympic sport .
this could be a regional ignorance .
the united states didn &apos;t win any medals on the trampoline and athletes to compete for the finals and send a rising yarışmacı wasn &apos;t until 2012 .
men and women in the chinese and russians and canadians in the awards , the chinese tend to share .
dong from china and canada this year , rosie maclennan won gold medals in london when they try to protect .
but the event , attracting attention as an oppressed adeta trampolini in his ears to clown school instead of the olympics , partly because it could be considered worthy of unconscious .
i must admit i &apos;m not an expert in here , i have just interest .
there &apos;s a funny potential ( like a cartoon created tremors like never ending jump ) , but the two together in the gym and sports reflects the elegance and diving .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; word comes from a trampoline , in spanish hands ; this is the &quot; trampoline &quot; anlamını taşıyor .
almost 30 feet high on the trampoline champion candidates from the air and a big jump from their own feet before landing on a series of action ( twist and somersault , pike ) they required .
according to official olympic program , according to a &quot; flight time &quot; and perform assessed .
16 from 17 countries , including 16 women in rio , a man thirty two athletes going to fight .
the most common in the olympics is far from true progress .
in some cases , those who seek to take gold medal to the finish , as far back in some cases , up and down movements further , faster and more must come up .
they &apos;re not just the beginning or the finish line after the wall at the same time , there &apos;s another tough line on the air on tv ; the world or olympic record .
this ambitious effort in the extreme levels and even noble , mouthwatering ; the audience enough to strangle her , even a burst into tears .
however , in light of the things i found this exhausting just watching games .
all this makes your verebilme trampolini , sometime .
trampolini upward moves .
goals aren &apos;t moving forward .
jumps up and down like an astronaut looking upward , weightless , effortlessly up again .
of course it &apos;s not not challenge or competition for results during the routine , but there is no time and gravity busily uzaklıkta disappeared , just like a dream , elegantly suspension .
so how much could be an olympic race chilloot chilloot .
the finals will be held in the rankings after women and one friday afternoon , eastern time ; men in 13 again on saturday .
nbc , every two days after lunch as a block from the finals will be at that time .
in the middle of the olympic madness that can be tolerated in the fray , and they promise a great moment of quiet .
according to the wall street journal and the united states of consciousness a short while ago and just for ogling gymnast as suggested by mr dooley &apos;s new fans by offering objectifying male athletes , we can tell if an increase in waiting .
that is an ally of the united states in ethiopia for a long time &quot; in a generation of protest &quot;
violent protests in ethiopia
demonstrators demanding political change in ethiopia , the government met with fierce resistance .
a number of witnesses , police and protesters in the lethal weapon , saying that the conflict .
ethiopia is about to collapse ?
over the past ten years , one of africa &apos;s most stable nations , with a strong and fast growing economy were allied to the west .
but in recent months has shaken the country , the anti-government protests spread to the region more every day .
just last week , thousands of people based on fundamental political changes in demand was found on the street .
human rights groups , according to the government &apos;s response was pretty brutal .
witnesses said several police officers shot an unarmed demonstrators , and killed .
late last year , or from the beginning of this year , it is believed to be in your hands , footage of a protest against a wall and security officials who had to stop whipping boys görülüyor .
the united nations human rights official at the highest level now want to be a thorough search .
the international crisis group , a research group the horn of africa project director rashid abdi , &quot; this is the country together and it will be more difficult it was hard to always keep moving forward , &quot; he said .
after the highest population of africa , nigeria and ethiopia nation stability is appreciated by the west .
american military and intelligence services , particularly in somalia to fight with terrorist threats in the region has been working closely with ethiopians , and there are very few countries in west africa to see so much to help .
ethiopia &apos;s economy , has been growing in an impressive way .
improved infrastructure in an effective way . there is even a new commuter train in addis ababa , the capital .
in the streets , usually quiet and safe and clean .
as much as the best example of democracy in ethiopia and display ( referring to the government &apos;s repressive human rights groups are constantly attitude ) was extremely limited domestic opposition , the opposition were effectively being shushed .
most of the exiled , imprisoned , murdered or driven to the farthest reaches of the desert .
however , may be about to change this situation .
i thing teshome , from ethiopia in the middle of a university lecturer with &quot; people drown them out of these events , and if you don &apos;t have a choice of protest , &quot; he said .
all youth in protest .
a generation in protest .
the ruling coalition has been a lot of pressure on the strength of the current complaint .
last year , the ruling party and its allies in the area in the pretty criticism then and now fill 100 per cent of the last seat in parliament , the opposition took control .
hundreds of people lost their lives in the same time , in june that led to war and tensions on the border with eritrea with sharp and controversial line is increasing .
oromo liberation front og national liberation front , analysts or separatist groups in the past few years as a shield from the middle of this turbulence by taking advantage of the fear of new armaments .
beneath the surface for years now there are several factors explain why he was in the bitter feelings in conglutinate patlamak .
the first looks innocent : smart phones .
cheap smart phones and internet service is established as mainstream as a large number of social media to communicate using only a few years ago , ethiopian has begun .
the government shut down access to facebook and twitter in protest at the time , especially as so often , even most people were able to communicate through proxy servers lnternet hidest positions .
for a couple of young ethiopian protests gathered in this way , he said .
the second as ethiopia &apos;s two largest ethnic group , and in solidarity between am oromolar arttı .
and in normal am oromolar not allies .
a long time , the predominantly christian ethiopia &apos;s mountainous areas in and out in front of the most muslims in politics and business am flatlands oromoları abuse that occurred in to it .
but in this situation is changing .
mula gemechu with the oromo leader a &quot; co-operate and we &apos;re moving in under an umbrella , &quot; he said .
oromo and am regions , the biggest protests seen in .
most of the am and oromo , ethiopia &apos;s military , intelligence services that make up about 6 per cent of the population , and members of ethnic tig group dominant in politics , trade and dominated by the way he thinks he &apos;s been unfair .
meles zenawi &apos;s death was the third reason lies behind the unrest .
former rebel leader in 2012 , mr. meles , until she died from an undisclosed illness for 17 years served as prime minister of ethiopia .
not everyone who saw a tactical genius , it was considered to be .
analysts identify and neutralize the first signs of discontent , especially her rivals and appease expert says .
mr. abdi , &quot; the regime that don &apos;t have basic information , &quot; said analyst conflict .
ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister hailemariam desalegn , mr. meles &apos;s location was chosen to fill in relative obscurity .
ethiopia &apos;s tigray north from the region on the contrary , mr. hailemariam , mr. meles &apos;s she &apos;s from the south .
analysts say that security services , kendisinin tig control didn &apos;t get his confidence .
as a result , the more fear and more blood spilled .
this kind of confusion about the experience in ethiopia in 2005 , the government after a sloppy choice analysts thousands of people in the theft after it was a protest .
following that measures less than a lot of protesters were killed in the past month , no matter how much time and if this mess and it &apos;s been relatively more quickly .
development experts , like infrastructure and poverty in ethiopia &apos;s leaders on the commuter train plans new vision to have made significant progress made .
but it didn &apos;t stop the kinini increase ethiopia against the government open .
and it &apos;s dangerous , and ethnic it .
last month , protesters have attacked a town in the am tig tig gonder , businesses and social media showing an increase in hate .
the united states , protests , analysts and other allies in the west says he left in a strange situation .
the u.s. government in neighbouring somalia , ethiopia was using as a base for drone flights over ; however , this base were told to shut down a short time ago .
obviously he wanted to support democracy in a region already fragile western ally that don &apos;t want to break up , too .
mr. abdi said , &quot; it &quot; and added &quot; it &apos;s like walking on a thin rope . &quot;
donald trump , obama &apos;s isis claim that as the &quot; sarcasm &quot; kurduğu kılar direction
donald j. last week , trump insisted that a couple of times on friday , president obama and hillary clinton &apos;s claim that islamic state terror group while citing &quot; founders &quot; is not a serious campaign tried to eliminate the last conflict in the area .
republican presidential candidate &apos;s ability to communicate clearly with this explanation , she gave birth to new questions about the american people .
in the process that created this mess in the same time who did her best to defend her statement that they tried to explain that this is not that their deputies in the process put in an awkward position .
mr. trump , at a rally on wednesday night after he was found at that premise in interviews , the president and mrs. clinton &apos;s thesis on thursday that the more reinforcing isis insists that really happened .
but in the early morning hours on friday , mr. trump made a sarcastic post on twitter , just in the statement said .
send in a series of interviews , mr. trump &apos;s accusation that it is serious about a day earlier to step back from that statement was completely showing .
conservative radio host hugh hewitt , mr. obama wants to destroy isis , and added that mr. trump &apos;s comments , republican presidential candidate said he didn &apos;t believe it when he tried to help him in anti-alias .
when you &apos;re trying to change the focus of the campaign , mr. trump , in the polls in the last confusión afterdrop ortaya çıktı .
mr. trump and mrs. clinton , made in michigan this week with conflicting speeches about the economy .
on friday , mr. trump wanted to continue that again .
mrs. clinton &apos;s talking about his proposals would increase taxes on twitter again and he found boring speech , he said .
before mr. trump used his sarcasm .
towards the end of july , ms. clinton &apos;s e-mails to the russians who suggested pirate attacks after a great view , these comments after meeting possed criticism &quot; of course , a cynic that i said , &quot; he explained .
this approach is to push the limits of mr. trump &apos;s political conversation and allows him to step back in place .
ruth sherman , a communications specialist with the language used by both candidates &quot; that certain messages supporters as he way how to react to seeing testing , depending on a system that allows him to &quot; explain &quot; response in a way , &quot; he said .
but at the same time , knowing that it &apos;s different when viewed from the lens and giving statements to be filtered belirsiz know .
a drop in the polls in recent days after the general election , mr. trump has embraced a more aggressive stance to take a lot to clear the air mass .
a new nbc / wall street journal / marist poll published on friday , mr. trump in virginia and colorado , north of coraline and it was quite a tight race in florida back mrs. clinton &apos;s current showed .
how mr. trump to apologize for saying something provocative every usually avoid blaming his critics in the words to understand humour or to mislead .
but mr. trump &apos;s presidential campaign in recent months , so much more exposed to examine how provocative comments in a position to support him in public , jokes , even if the rest of his loyal supporters , leaving a difficult situation .
former new york city mayor rudolph w. koetzle giuliani , one of the most prominent supporters of mr. trump in an interview with cnn on thursday as he did everything to defend the island .
mr. trump , mr. obama and mrs. clinton in the direction of the islamic state in question was asked about mr. giuliani , the thesis that &quot; i think doing a legitimate political criticism , &quot; he said .
from one perspective , obama , who was unknown , a small organisation isis before them was totally wrong because of a pullout from iraq that was cute and soldiers .
obama administration &apos;s most prominent republican , mrs. clinton &apos;s secretary of state with the situation in the middle east that failed to deal with isis to grow aggressively and trying to defend why it happened .
trump &apos;s rallies in pennsylvania on friday , before twisting the word via twitter and news media continues to accuse him of being biased against it .
trying to figure out her &quot; poor , pathetic , &quot; tv experts sarcastically , &quot; they can &apos;t do that ! &quot; he said .
some democrats , mr. trump mockingly suggested that the evidence was not appropriate for president under his direction , he said .

mr. president , who knows how to keep most people who struggle the most important thing about this unusual , but when he chooses aid-de-camp confidentiality .
a lot of hypocrites .
&quot; this is the most important evidence is not business as fetö , a retired preacher can &quot; be as deep as this is one of the testimony of a conspiracy .

the sun &apos;s rays and the impact of the thousands of part of a comet called mtake perseid meteor shower &quot; - swift tuttle &quot; and that made this situation would become the natural visual esenoğlu adeta , he said .

perseid meteors voicing watch for esenoğlu in july and august rain , &quot; from outer space , we watched a visual feast that we have to take care of . &quot;

erdogan , less educated , former soccer player
if that balance , less educated , recep tayyip erdogan , who led by former player with a large extent a religious populist islam fethullahçıs gülen , the entrepreneur from texas who founded the institute of high school and college education more than a thousand to moscow-one educated followers of the alliance was the winner .
last week , in the top foreign policy in the sentence in an article published in translation .
erdogan , who graduated college and less educated , former soccer player ; if that qualify as an entrepreneur , open-minded and gülen &apos;s graduate school , often cited in articles like this and laugh openly praised disciples of the western press .
after that , on the other hand , &quot; why america rising opposition in turkey and / or the west ? &quot; in these articles titled &quot; because erdogan . &quot; they &apos;re trying to bring in a statement to start with sentences .
in the west turkey , erdogan &apos;s turkey as a situation that analysts see securing nevzuh is ignorant of history at the time to think that it was possible .
in fact , judging by statistics , the opposition in turkey , erdogan &apos;s first period on average ten years or less can be read as a period when the west .
ten years in the united states and european union because it is in sync with good relations in the form of was ongoing .
erdogan &apos;s &quot; don &apos;t be criticised , with one minute israel in syria as a result of the massacres by the assad regime in the eu &apos;s inability put out a clear policy on the outbreak of war and refugee crisis , european parliament president schulz like turkey , leaving some figures in britain , &quot; we &apos;re not dealing with erdogan &quot; şeklindeki contractor , and that &apos;s open attitude to the present time , the lord mayor of london competition unfaith erdogan the secretary of state in the last to win , you can &apos;t imagine a poetry of nastiness in turkey pkk suicide bomber entered the country from syria and pkk &apos;s syrian arm , while the slaughter of our citizens need to fix the ypg in syria , the united states need to exhibitions in europe , the glorification of the açtırılırk office serving soldiers wearing ypg uniforms crested special representative in charge of fighting with daesh , brett mcgurk , special visits to the ypg to opposition groups were left alone to turkey , as unthreatening as the ypg that turkey , on the other hand , the shifting intelligence and logistical support to ypg and daesh in mosul and baghdad , in line with the united states are scorned struggle with the support of many similar pressure to reduce the size of our group and why .
come on , we lose as a result of the bloody coup , while 247 people from the united states and eu countries that the so-called ailies any support for the first time about the absences as proven failure over our democracy , &quot; peace and stability in turkey , &quot; kerry , and they expect to build democracy if we forgot could do no emphasis on the elected government .
well , charlie hebdo in paris that killed 11 of the world , including turkey , but many leaders who joined the protest march for democracy , resisting the tanks for the coup attempt , 247 people were killed over a month later , the &quot; allies &quot; turkey has yet to be any western country not have forgotten how any of the president ?
a few times a year for the refugee situation is that what we &apos;re going to send high-level representatives or representative level under who presidents ?
the eu and us ambassadors to wish me all the broken glass to daily hurriyet , turkey and bombed the grand national assembly passed a solidarity visit we will evaluate how the absence ?
when the coup in egypt in the eu &apos;s top representative in the first two weeks now after the coup leader , shook hands with a coup by sending kerry &apos;s visit , &quot; democracy is being rebuilt , &quot; he said , remembering the resistance to support democracy in turkey &apos;s leadership coup upraise western countries say they worry they &apos;re called every chance of avoiding the lack of genuine democracy in turkey , turkey too crazy ?
whereas 95 % of the public be allowed to live freely in the united states see as responsible for the coup &apos;s laughing now , even infuriating enough to turkish citizens .
upstairs in the background , i think i counted only if it adds to the opposition that there was a situation that could be explained with erdogan open to the western / america rising .
the united states and still thinks it &apos;s not even in a coup , erdogan etkisinin said .
so never thought he was not the details
&quot; it is de minimis thought , &quot; he says , adding that his own people , young voters , who like to see himself as &quot; ignorant , scratching her stomach &quot; idiots , they can play from the same page , july 15 after humiliating night trip , i wonder ?
i wonder how people saw this and the state of democracy &quot; where are we , we were wrong &quot; after answering the question is called ?
but the answer the questions that must be found so much ?
being a traitor , who served in various departments to use their weapons until yesterday , a moment about how the government and the officers &quot; traitor &quot; and asked for asylum from foreign governments accepted entranceto status .
how do we live in a mental error , and how people will be considered as an obsession with observingthese davranışlara perverslon environment we need to see that .
when it comes to an attempted coup scrambled brains .
turkey &apos;s cities beyond syria &apos;s cities for this demonstration liken it to a point of view we &apos;ve got one ?
an officer why his country &apos;s parliament that the bombs ?
with the brain of the fetö nün curses , it is probably a mistake to wait for behavior like we shouldn &apos;t fall .
but we know that everything is not only responsible for other responsible fetö .
as a career in politics , fight against hatred and hate , they are providing the necessary contributions to tragedies .
in all kinds of illegal behavior , presenting themselves as &quot; enlightened &quot; aymazların on natural and even nasty he &apos;s convinced olduğuna masses .
guns in the hands of those who hate his own people , even when they opened fire in the end , we saw how that give the public .
we know the way , way of democracy
i &apos;m telling you something very simple : people in turkey on the evening of 15 july in at number fetö , soldier , gave more than 250 the sergerde tufeyl on thieves to set up to save democracy and martyrs .
but in the back of the july 15 , 1992-2002 ; 2002-2012 ; and then there are three times to 2012 .
there are three changes to these three döneminde prepared : economic , social , political .
social change made two big phenomenon : this is a very long time from the countryside around towns of nomads migration and metropolis after being moved to the station .
that said i was moving through the subway on wednesday .
i have also stressed that the most important element of social change don &apos;t call the subway .
the second big change in line with the same bridges and roads .
the bridge road to modernization and contribute to bringing more easily understandable .
the economic and social structure , will change .
we changed that much is a political structure .
i identified more than this date in istanbul on the throat atılan bridges since .
demirel , crossing the bosphorus bridge on the tests .
this was the pinnacle of the 1960s peasant movement after 1950 .
the name of progress in the same direction as the bridge on 15 july martyrs özal , now that we kept the bridge and the second .
this shows the relationship between the environment - even established routes .
he &apos;s a sign of how a social change in course being monitored .
demirel &apos;s intention was to melt in the big party and the masses .
it is to adopt them was the center &apos;s ideology .
a third bridge over the years , the ak party didn &apos;t do it .
because migration was driving at full speed .
satellite cities that people are in place .
in those areas has been a bit of a closed system .
local governments , business people from the ak party , they gave the ak party to vote for vaccination , social status .
so that the masses at the centre of political consciousness around then , not melting and the adoption &quot; as their own &quot; was asked to come to the station .
the ak party before the ongoing debate in this formation ( 1992-2002 ) and it was relevant .
these discussions with people not to stand side by side in the conservative , pious and backwoods-bred integration lmperative agreed to the masses .
the ak party in 2002 , and then i pointed out the way the masses by moving into politics , pride , siyasallaştırdı added .
now , after all this careful , 3 . construction of the bridge &apos;s real-time democratic struggle in july 15 .
so , history and sociology matches .
i might add another dimension to this : istanbul bridge with only the ak party &apos;s move is not limited to , i &apos;m talking about .
it &apos;s something more interesting : the city , the ak party headquarters neighboring cities now incorporating them .
through two bridges in this location .
one , osmangazi bridge .
two , the 1915 bridge .
add that the roads .

quite often in recent years , the heir to a growing disease .
the primary factor in that genetic kinship ; foot long , long working hours and increase their living heir to the things that would stop for a long time .
vessels used for cardiac surgery do ?
i have in the future heir to , if i have a heart attack , what do you do ? it is often by people interested in questions like .
that &apos;s answers to questions .
there are two types of in the leg venous system :
the who said the main road leading to the lungs and blood , dirty , dirty blood 1.bacakta deep venous system we have the leg .
these are the femoral vein and superficial femoral vein deep take your name .
it &apos;s more rare diseases and problems in the veins , arteries in vessels that can be closed for targeted drug treatments remain open .
in the leg venous system deep in the lungs and groin which merged with dirty blood , leading the way we have to say superficial venous system .
we said , this system is the saphenous vein consists of two counts of grand and two small veins .
this is the heir to the failure in four of them and develop .
that can be used for cardiac surgery is the saphenous vein called cava superficial veins , great .
this is not a body that &apos;s why there is no harm can be used for cardiac surgery and blood vessels .
but it &apos;s veins , arteries in heart surgery should be healthy for them .
because his heart , a very important organ .
varicose veins removed surgically , deep vein of blood vessels had been in place in the cremation , or a laser that can reduce the workload and provides more leg to be healthy .
varicose veins and arteries , which is a fallacy in the community as a backup if that could be used .
varicose veins and arteries of heart surgeries never never never .
there are other vessels that can be used for cardiac surgery .

the vast majority of alcoa and al plant , japan &apos;s marubeni corp of china &apos;s citic belongs to joint venture and have smaller shares in companies .
&quot; cry , of portland , waiting for him to continue to work this means that the smelting in physical demand for electricity will continue , &quot; he said .

the termination of contracts , alcoa &apos;s decision , &quot; alcoa &apos;s smelting quarry did not affect his ability to ensure electricity supply to the smelting business , or &quot; he said .
the company signed a contract from the united states in 2010 , 20 ; the contract that was supposed to go into effect in november this year if it was ever taken of this contract , but not yet explained why .

in a new commission denetimi controversial asset fund
turkey , which is expected to be among the world &apos;s largest fund of funds being quietly removed the bag on his objections .
you don &apos;t have that discussion of the new supervisory mechanism of the fund has been decided but no değişiklik yapılması again due to the commission also discussed .
turkey &apos;s akp and chp mp , assessing the presence of legislation to fund the plan and budget committee member utku çakıröz is sozcu.com.tr , &quot; state-owned entities , the proletariat , employees will be taken away from zorunluğu pension cuts , the unemployed collected unemployment fund that will be composed of constitutional structure , we absolutely refuse to outside monitoring mechanisms , &quot; he said .
the government &apos;s investment fund set up in order to fund long-term projects , and the opposition should be discussed in the direction of the law also offer turkey views as out of the omnibus bill on tuesday .
but today the same as it is brought back to the akp offer plan and budget commission .
chp member of parliament and budget commission plan eskiþehir anxiety and concerns about the law , chp mp , utku çakıröz is being proposed to fund told sozcu.com.tr .
Çakıröz is , &quot; this fund kurulması plan and budget komisyonu omnibus bill when it came in , the chp &apos;s delegation in the former finance minister zechariah temizel on , anxiety and concerns expressed , suggested that the law also offer a detailed account of the bag and chambers . &quot;
the bill was pulled back the government to accept that view .
the bill came to the commission the same way again yesterday .
&quot; the government insists that in a week removed from parliament , &quot; he said .
that is supposed to be a compromise to fund law çakıröz is , &quot; this law in the us offer our biggest concern is the outrageous . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s in the public domain the assets , the proletariat , employees will be taken away from zorunluğu pension cuts , the unemployed collected unemployment fund will consist of revenues , privatisation of the revenues , parliament and one that doesn &apos;t have any responsibility being transferred out of control and unregulated by the court structure , &quot; he said .
this kind of funds from the gulf states and russia , china and the surplus oil revenues are established , and the funds that trade is in this way , &quot; but we are in deficit savings . &quot; çakıröz is financed
that &apos;s why the fund will consist of public resources , money , so the public .
the total 100 billion to fund unemployment , workers with offended to be transferred money from the privatisation of the 100 billion individual pension fund , is scheduled to 50 billion .
&quot; so completely with public money that will be composed and don &apos;t need to make sure that money to fund public denetiminde irresponsible , &quot; he said .
the fund &apos;s assets belong to the state capital in the state &apos;s resources , gathered outside parliament as a guarantee of the law , stressing that a proposal being unacceptable denetimi çakıröz is anxiety and concerns about fund şöyle told us :
the existence of such a big public spending , business and operations on behalf of the public , the audit , just not be dismissed for an independent audit companies be credited .
public transport will have to be a transparent and structure .
the law &apos;s provisions on transparency , being offered and no constitutional institutions denetimi fund .
not a restriction on how much resource to be transferred .
no one to ask about how the funds were used this account .
the fund is shown as a justification for the purpose of funding major projects .
i don &apos;t need to establish a fund supervision outside of the budget for it .
why you don &apos;t get into the budget ?
like this in mind when it comes naturally , &quot; and why of parliamentary oversight of numerous get out ? &quot; the question is . &quot;
fund transfers of money , but they &apos;re not against it in the presence of investments , is that they are against having çakıröz is not transparent vermeyen mechanisms account added : &quot; that &apos;s what needs to fund a questionable . &quot;
but he insists on it , then this sort of investment funds , if the government was formed in turkey in other countries to ensure we have to apply current international standards .
there should be made in a way to control and responsibility getirildiği mechanism .
the hearsay won &apos;t be used on her own money to pay every penny , in a way to account should be formed .
they are definitely the way the law commission &apos;s proposal to fund presence underlined that , &quot; especially the akp çakıröz is july 15 coup attempt in parliament , we &apos;re delighted that after listening to our criticism . &quot;
we hope that the law in our criticism constructive offer and the akp &apos;s ear .
the national assets , which is used as a transfer rules , that we are against using public inspectn olmamasına olmasına and irresponsible .
&quot; if it could be useful to sate these concerns , however , fund asset , &quot; he said .
the law work towards reconciliation between akp and the opposition on the proposal was made .

that doesn &apos;t involve hot water and co2 , surface , venus , a model with a time when the world to determine whether similar conditions to host full with the atmosphere was designed .
scientists in the past to explain the low rate of rotation , with the atmosphere was thick layer of venus .
however , the new estimates still has an atmosphere like earth and venus may have been thin , suggests you might be able to come slowly .
former model looked topographical and venus .
if the current dry zone in the world of the planet more than enough to vaporize water and geographic fluidity and quick once may have had to protect against .
in the same time , 30 per cent more in a dimly lit old venus , was to take advantage of the sun .
scientist anthony del genio , hide in a news bulletin &quot; secret model to simulate the venus slow curve every time he makes it to be facing the sun for nearly two months of the day , &quot; he said .
in the sun &apos;s surface , warming the surface layers of thick cloud that acts like an umbrella to protect against warming caused by the rain clearing a path .
as a result , in our day the earth was just a few degrees colder than average temperatures from climate was unfolding .
venus , planet evolution model , suggesting establishment of a similar story for scientists as a hypothesis made before .
although conditions suitable for life once , venus would have a lot of heat and ultraviolet light in the process a few billion years old have been exposed .
vaporized the oceans have been burned to death with ultraviolet light and water vapor .

the team measured the speed of the stars in the pleiades star , kepler
the kepler space telescope , astronomers with the pleiades constellation of stars in the last mission in terms of ability to create the most complete catalogue helped speeds .
new data , astronomers in the constellation of stars and planet formation is going on to be understood why the return of interest with variable speed helps .
a research scientist at caltech in pasadena &apos;s infrared processing and analysis center luisa rebull , a news bulletin on the &quot; results of our star clusters and when we compare , a star mass , age and even in the solar system , we &apos;re hoping the ability to learn more information about the relationship between the past , &quot; he said .
445 of the world , the pleiades constellation light years away .
125 million years ago and formed new stars in the constellation of reaching the level of new adult .
they return to the best possible life at high speed .
the stars in this phase of growth in the top speeds , a large amount of star represents the wind .
this represents a break in the effect on older stars in the magnetic fields of stars .
the older you get a star turn rate starts to fall .
like the sun spots can be a star , kepler rate of rotation every difference between watching the measure marks a star appearance .
the latest speeds faster than the stars more massive stars , small forward &apos;s back catalogue underway .
on one leg of the big stars like dancers , rebull returns carried out a little more slowly than those expressed in the way .
rebull , &quot; pleiades &apos;balesinde &quot; slow returned much more heavy , fast , we see the stars of the returnees is so light , &quot; he said . &quot;
the speed of the pleiades star constellation of qualities and was close to ideal for the return of a cosmic laboratory mission .
rebull &quot; pleiades constellation , young and old provides theoretical models for their return as star in both directions , &quot; he said .
the speed of the stars and how and why , when he fell into a corner , so to speak if &quot; your dancing shoes , &quot; there &apos;s a lot of things we wanted to know about why they left .
