representatives of the assistant doctors , bickering over a new contract with the trade unions &apos; business has asked for permission .

this is the members who voted for was rejected by 58 % .

russia and turkey : a &apos; uyumsuzlar alliance in ?
this is a crisis of sonlandıran jestti .
the leaders of russia and turkey , and later seized on tuesday , and the ongoing economic sanctions are the eight months of the war officially came together to announce sonlandırıldığını .
however , the st. petersburg , vladimir putin , at the palace of the grand turk mevkidaşını selamlarken , this compromise is the most obvious ankara who are under the impression that past life .
al sıkışıldı , yes .
however , mr putin &apos;s own zayıftı gülümsemesi is quite limited , even against the standards , and any other matter promoted by temperature .
on the contrary , prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has repeatedly &quot; good friend &quot; of mr. putin &apos;s ; a five times , according to the report .
i am the number of .
he also said that relations with russia will not remain dönmekle pre-crisis level , much more ulaşacağının has pledged to high levels .
the following day , a daily newspaper here , mr. erdogan &apos;s is never a bad thing to mock markovic said .
i don &apos;t think that his heyecanı argues otherwise .
however , mr putin &apos;s cold shooting that intiba , russia &apos;s leader has shown that he did nothing .
in fact , the first thing we said in a statement at the opening of the crisis , the cardinal : turkey &apos;s border with syria , the russian war plane shot him .
then , russia &apos;s reaction to the hiddet were everywhere .
mr putin has made a sharp exit from ankara to moscow on the bıçaklamakla .
much more had great kırgınlık , quitting is the friendly against the will of the entity .
rebuilding trust is real , it will be difficult , perhaps impossible .
since november , the idea of the people of russia has changed .
the state-controlled media , staggering for several months , and aggressive in a way that targeted the ankara .
suddenly , everything became a criminal the turks .
most of them ciddileri , top operators of mr. erdogan &apos;s family , the so called islamic state in syria &apos;s place in areas under the control of illegal oil suçlamalardı claim that profit from it .
he has flatly rejected it .
from the st. petersburg , however , the official message is the logical time to move on .
ultimately , the realisation of this meeting because of mr. putin , president erdogan demanded the apology was received .
russia can see it as a sort of victory .
the benefits for ankara to call for a ceasefire is very clear .
first , erdogan &apos;s meeting last month , and almost topple in the wake of the failed coup , which is why they will need dostlara .
repeat terrorist attacks in turkey , also came away impressed by him .
in addition , the effective economic reasons .
sanctions imposed by russia &apos;s hit hard ; each year , especially in the coastal regions of turkey , a few million of special flights carrying russian tourists to be banned .
the number fell by almost 90 % .
also in russia , tour operators and leasing companies will continue to be in the flights , and definitely feel relieved .
at the end of the season in the mediterranean have extracted depend on it .
and this week , the state tv , the turkish agricultural products ithalatlarına allowed to rebuild , and a decrease in the price of fruits and vegetables predicted .
in a speech vedemosti haberden turistler , &quot; we will get there , domatesler here , &quot; he said .
however , the visit to moscow , in a separate political value was available .
ankara , in response to the coup in the west for the adequate , but more angry .
to participate in the united states due to the pace of progress in the talks on the salyangoz his anger eklendiğinde is in for a long time , turkey &apos;s ties with the west and the soğukluktan kopmasından mr. putin is seeking to benefit from it .
the russian leader in the wake of the coup attempt is certainly due to the support of elected officials to call for sympathy seems to be accumulated from ankara .
remember , that itself is a radical regime change in moscow for fear of the inevitable tutumdu .
the sea was this glossy at this summit , russia and turkey , it seems to me that in a way that released by analysts as a &quot; uyumsuzlar represents the alliance &quot; : the west &apos;s , and the two countries have refused to mock the poor .
the display , though , it played görüntüsüne , but remain pretty farklılar .
one of the most important of them about syria : although itself as a mediator in moscow , russia and turkey supports the different parties .
almost three hours of talks following the first two , but focused on this issue in his press conference , it will also support it .
turkey &apos;s president , this is a question about the differences and yanıtlamaktan made it clear that , while mr. putin underscored çizmeyi chose them .
the common ground in syria on the issue of how there is not a clear consensus .
after several months , however , have made it clear that the ongoing husumetten - and nato member turkey &apos;s russian war plane shot düşürmesiyle created given the potential for absolute disaster - at least in the beginning of the two leaders to talk is certainly a good development .

however , when we had the work and kendimizin , but with the needs of customers odaklanmamız göreceğinizi i think that too many changes .
re sokabiliriz of these brands , that &apos;s why i think this is the right time .

i really would like to see how the world has changed at alarming .
young people and children is no longer a game to play out , preferring to spend time ekranlara , saying it was in the past ten years , most of the people was an üzüldüğü .
pokemon go kanepeden and encourage people to act .
ekranlara , saying most time , especially in the tv and video oyunlarına sınırlıyken over time and , finally , smart telefonlara until it has spread .
for this reason , technology and each other to act in the open air is not drawn up elements is really wonderful to see .
of course , in the 90 &apos;s , especially in the video game , which was created for the express line ( and later , playing cards , and the other side turned into products ) , a practice dating back to the karakterlere pokémon go , i am referring to .
a lot of popular culture , like olgusu , this new play at the beginning of july in the united states , australia and new zealand also is submitted ortalığı katmıştı each other .
later , the extreme yüklemeye sunucularda due to the intense interest in other countries , it has been postponed .
over the course of several days pokémon go tinder more and almost the same number of twitter users .
but what about how it ?
in short , if necessary , to explain to the players , smart phones , gps and follow up , and the way to search for pokémon bulduklarının çekebiliyor in a photo on the screen with her &apos; ( by telephone ) or yakalayabiliyor , in them .
a game played at a younger generation of this madness for the arayış kanepeden , took part in the event .
play in the united states , &quot; he said , &quot; with an average of one person every day , and the number of steps taken by a substantial increase .
developed for the apple watch , a monitoring and enforcement of 35,000 kullanıcıyı cardiogram , shortly before he was to play in the washington post , in the next two days , by people who do not exercise every day for 30 days , the rate of people from 45 per cent to 53 per cent , have risen , he said .
the company does not know who played a pokémon go ; only the raw data at the level of exercise has told people .
&quot; we want people to set aside time for 30 minutes , &quot; &quot; kanepeden removal &quot; and &quot; to be active every day , most of the &quot; encouraging the public health campaign , most of the public health message was boring and perişan noted by people who seem to be largely ignored .
but still , the importance of how egzersizin vurgulansa .
those who do not exercise on a regular basis , there is the possibility of cancer or depression .
the exercise of control , on issues such as high blood pressure and diabetes , and that would help listelenemeyecek here has a long list of benefits to .
pokémon go &apos;s beauty , however , the people enjoying their çıkarmasıdır to make something out of it .
in this way , the health karşılanır in three key elements : action , clean air and sun , and the light entertainment .
some people even the new friends edinebilmektedir during a hunting trip .
business as usual , looking for something to complain suratsız oyunbozanlar are also available .
marched in the door -- and , of course , is one of çarpabilir .
what will make a difference ?
presented in a major innovation .
smart phone applications , such as the fitbit hareketimizi although to us in this game , as well as a reason to exercise sunmadı .
go ahead and use the influence of yeniliğin will slowly peter out .
however , because of the success of the pokémon , practices and virtual reality in the real world activities and ava broke through to people more active , healthy , and that the game will be a lot of help .

vinil goal : a record of who actually buy the areas ?
the middle of elderly , lonely men &apos;s vinile bayılıyor .
tümyalnızortayaşlıerkeklerÖyledeğil under the magnificent hakaretlerde before heading to interpretation of this data was based on the actual beyanın söylememize give permission .
according to yougov , a subject of much mentioned plakların return of a physical object is not created by innovation peşindeki y kuşağının , middle age is a result of the nostaljisinin .
areas buy vinil album any time soon are mostly between the ages of 45 and 54 .
the status , the 18 to 24 age group is the lowest .
this is also not only meraklıların biriktirme campaign ; an emotional significance ; the older vinil recipients usually feelings of self love saklamayı ( 56 % and 53 % ) , and the isolation of enjoying ( 69 % and 66 % ) people .
but what about the results of the yougov , true ?
in this blog , if he were in a televised news , the camera of a crowded street in soho , with a number of modest gray elbise , and said that while many gesture before and after opening ellerimi and something like this authoritarian izlerdi said : &quot; an eye atalım at the time , &quot; he said .
at that time , a flamboyant atalım .
slowly , in the centre of soho büyüsünü and extraordinary flair and independent vendors ( in a time where the buildings are no longer hotels , eats , filled with prets and paperchases ) is still available in a few specialist record stores .
probably for the next part i would like to stand kameradan ; this department stores close to the cause of men of different ages , saying it through observation and position itself as ljubicic information about emotional situations .
sister ray ( the census data : two young women , three middle man ) reckless records ( the census data : in the middle of the eight men , probably 20 years old , i went to a women &apos;s ) glasgowlu stuart ( 55 ) , for a meeting in the afternoon sonrasını is playing in london and a few stores to fill the empty saatini takes .
a collector : he hadn &apos;t .
&quot; i think i öyleyim , &quot; he says .
nearly 3,000 or 4,000 plağa i have .
this is the official involved in the above plaklar ( official emails and sent it to me , i never followed him home by the walls of the sitting room ) .
by such a large number of albums and singles toplamasının is because , in part , a result of a disposable income ; when the money is no longer can afford the first plakları meteliksiz and young and can buy back the time of trading .
&quot; most of the things that i get to 60 to 70 at the beginning of the end of the wars , i am opposed to more when he was 11 or 12 things ; to get a very young olduklarım , &quot; he says .
those who buy the record to stay alone , keeping people looking likely to qualify , agrees , and adds : &quot; smoking içmem , very alcohol also failed .
this is my bad huyum .
wez working in sister ray ( 25 ) , most of the clients in the yougov profile , she thinks .
however , he said , media exaggerated reklamlardan hit by a new wave of people , those who come back from this modanın plakları needs to buy back the old could make a difference .
my meetings , normally in 1998 or 1999 i felt a total overhaul of their people .
for the purchase of the cd sells vinillerini plakları customers will now have to get back to acquire sells cds , &quot; he says .
this is a certain guarantees vinili re açıklayabilir increase in young people .
but what about the emotional significance of the alleged plakların ?
a store , such as phonica record shops similar kişilikte of comfort is a community of a few saniyenizi offers to make a difference .
wez , according to him , some of the older customers , especially temassız gücenmiş payment system .
some vinil enthusiasts said the digital world bunalmış recalling memories of his youth , and the quiet little record may be seeking asylum in the stability of kapaklarının .
wez says that ; &quot; sometimes the reason for that is to fill a gap in the items or material may be to see as a kind of comfort , &quot; he said .
a collector myself olduğumdan given most of these are there , and i think it is also compared to it .
this is a way to easy kafanızı doldurmanın .
yığınından swell to a record by a colleague as &quot; social workers , &quot; he said .
in april , a poll conducted last month vinil album of 50 % of the album dinlemediğini has not yet been disclosed .
at the same time , the poll found that 41 % said no and that it is not using a pikabı 7 per cent of the record , even though it &apos;s not çaları vinil bought .
at this stage of the story , possibly a series of included performances of bossa nova while bestesini sergilerdim , a very concerned look .
&quot; the award of this return in the &quot; sounds of the universe ( the census data : a man who works in the three middle ) , jonny ( 42 ) is a recognisable by .
&quot; one of the most recent came to me and i said : &quot; there is no record Çalarım rafımıza , however , to freeze a radiohead plağı , &quot; i want to get , &quot; he said .
this is a big yüzdeyi represented , although it certainly reflects the current situation .
more and more of the product , less music .
there are those people who let me said , adding : &quot; there is no record Çalarım . &quot;
these are not the elderly , young people , with a onlu , in the end , this issue is the new entry for those who do .
it is no longer a strict vinil for almost all of the dedicated to the fopp vardığımda kitlenin i can see that it is quite variable .
in the 70 years old couples , photo that attract tourists , young boys and elderly women in the medium .
the atmosphere is the above mentioned department stores ( the last part of the wild beast &apos;s ) and less dingin hoparlörlerden sakinleştirici jazz with pop mounts instead of sex , but would like to see more diversity among its customers better .
none of them , in particular , appear side by side with , however , is only one of 30 saniyeden bothering them for a long time , saying it is difficult psychological travmaları çözümlemek .
elanora ( 27 ) , a few dakikadır in fopp geziniyor and indirimdeki plaklara takes .
instead of spending it is just to look at the packed .
kazanmadığından record collection of more than he says there is no choice but to do it .
a very expensive .
bilgisayardan or other forms of listening to music , however , is more easily vinilin beauty ... &quot; sevdalı uzaklaşıyor internal , as one of them .
i don &apos;t know how to açıklayacağımı , really don &apos;t like it .
in the past , the new generation of vinil durağım tutkunlarına , a department store , said that the inspiration : the urban outfitters .
while the jeans trousers inceliyormuş , as a father and a daughter crosley record prior to the debate on the purchase of another of a polaroid cameras gathered around a group of young daughters gözlemliyorum .
left adele , jeff buckley , amy winehouse and fleetwood mac &apos;s plakları and there is a gap of a merdiven ; it is a must for an average of a collection of plaklar ; a mix of modern and klasiğin .
no one keen ; perhaps they only preserves is that it is aimed at , some dokunulamayacak yüksekte until now .
&quot; this is totally an artistic vinil , &quot; he said .
however , the wonder of these items for the sector to win more money and less müşteriyi soho could mean to send in the depths of ; there is no more complaints about that issue .
more than that of most of the money and time , a demographic group , such as vinil more luxury items for spending more money is not surprising .
bulgularım , however , that the results of the yougov &apos;s record , at least in the soho mağazalarında is true ; the more the number , gerçeklikte , record mağazalarında or online forums , and women who take into account the koleksiyoncular vinil tutkunlarını katmıyorlar .
these people , probably , we are working hard in school or at work .
the record is absolutely thursday , berwick caddesindeki mağazalarında gezerek , plakları introduced and in the middle of anything without men , 30 , via omuzlarının he forged a tv server by bakışlarından geçirmiyor .

and snapchat &apos;s report to the racial diversity of other karşıtlarından more young broad spectrum , which is also a higher level of sensitivity while there could be interpreted .

congressional paneli , the military authorities , falsified iŞİd İstihbaratını ettiğini says
in a report released on thursday , a congressional panel , the united states central command yetkililerinin , iraq and the islamic state in syria in the global fight against the events on the ground that it was a more optimistic picture to çizmek falsified intelligence reports .
sarayın armed services committee , the intelligence committee and the republican committee &apos;s subcommittee on defense paid a working arm of the heads of the council in a report on the backs of american forces in the islamic state &apos;s command centre , said he had changed the exploit the intelligence analysts &quot; is &quot; a widespread dissatisfaction .
centcom , known as the central command , in tampa , fla . , and in the middle east and central asia , which oversees american military operations in a military karargahtır .
a report on the reading from the news release said : &quot; approved by the leaders of the senior centcom intelligence results , typical of the united states , that the work of the prevention of terrorism than the facts on the ground for a more positive picture çizmekte and repeatedly by other elements of the intelligence community into analizlerden offers much more positive results , &quot; he said .
kaliforniyalı republican representative ken calvert , who was in &quot; centcom is unacceptable ; the bad analysis of senior decision makers sunulurken warriors &quot; demiştir towards units are going to be challenges .
centcom &apos;s leadership failures reached the highest levels of the company .
the 10-page report , the central command &apos;s america &apos;s training of iraqi forces to provide evidence that the work involved in the analysis of the statement and , in the 2014 and 2015 in the details of the permanent problems .
so , senior obama administration officials to change reports that the chain of evidence had not made the final analizcilerin iŞİd and daeŞ , also known as the islamic state &apos;s evidence that the threat to present a more optimistic view on the centcom açıklanmaktadır feels under pressure from the leaders .
&quot; in the first half of 2015 , the report said , many centre clear commanding press bulletin , thanks , and congressional testimonies and actual events more pozitifti &quot; denmektedir .
for example , a centcom official , as the public , to be taken back to mosul , a major military attack as early as april or may 2015 has said that at a time when it can be done .
in iraq &apos;s second largest city , mosul , the islamic state &apos;s kontrolündedir .
in the kansas republican representative mike pompeo , a declaration of &quot; aylar aspects of this in the wake of the research is pretty clear &quot; it demiştir .
in mid 2014 until the middle of 2015 , the centre for the study of the united states of america is one of the most senior leaders of the intelligence komutasının , in iraq , the threat posed by iŞİd insignificant to be launched , such as the intelligence has manipulated the results of the command .
republicans ( the analysts were manipulated intelligence about the islamic state expressed concern that he had created a working arm , after .
İncelemeler continues , the report released on thursday , is a much more comprehensive findings will follow .
by the inspector general of the ministry of defence , which has been under review for another centcom intelligence there is .
the democratic members of the house intelligence committee on thursday , the republican who participated in some of the conclusions reached by the working arm courtesy of its own findings .
head of the committee &apos;s democratic representative adam b. schiff , a declaration of &quot; centcom , between 2014 and 2015 , daeŞ and intelligence about the iraqi security forces is very narrow-değerlendirmelerinde created a process of &quot; demiştir .
mr. schiff &apos;s view , this process is delayed publication of the results of the &quot; intelligence , &quot; which led to morale bozukluğuna among analysts and enough space lent &quot; opposite views , &quot; he said .
but mr. schiff and the democrats , the white house &apos;s &quot; by the results of the centcom analysts previously set or political pressure to present a &quot; fabrication that uyguladığına bulguya ulaşmadıklarını has said .
the preliminary results of the congressional incelemesinin on tuesday by the daily beast duyurulmuştur .
last august , the new york times , centcom analysts following complaints by a pentagon inspector general is the current incelemesinin bildirmiştir .
senior lieutenant commander patrick evans , a spokesman for the pentagon , as a declaration of general müfettişin incelemesinin continues in the ministry of defence would not comment on a report that the congress has said .
however , he said , &quot; in some cases , the experts to interpret complex data over düşebileceklerini and intelligence community and the defense department on this important national security concerns related to &quot; supports healthy dialogue . &quot;
the research , iraq and the american-led bombing in syria since the operation would continue and that the repercussions beyond uyandıracaktır ( this is every day more and more by a defense official savdır ) .
the charges in the last year , however , president obama &apos;s iraq , afghanistan , libya and other parts of the crisis for the honest assessments from military operations in the central command revealed how güvenebileceği question .
the islamic state of criticism that intelligence yansıtılmasına , centcom intelligence analyst gregory hooker &apos;s , president george w. bush administration , despite the fact that many analysts explained in a small force in iraq , and that it has been bulundurulmasını occupied in 2003 , said he was not considering enough sonrasını wrote in an article that was already being discussed , and more than a decade .
mr hooker , who is also information related to the islamic state , also played an important role in the isyanda .
officials said that mr. hooker &apos;s team last year , despite public statements to the contrary , in the hands of the islamic state of the airstrikes against bringing rafinerilere black oil refineries in the interim to sell than they were in the construction of the terrorist group &apos;s financial resources and a etkilemediği had concluded .
however , the times &apos; as in september that finding out of the central command &apos;s remains .
centcom &apos;s making the then general lloyd j. austin iii , last year , the senate &apos;s statement of the law of war by koyucu very is seen as a positive assessment , it is up to the criticism .
he was a retired general austin in april , and his people , who replaced centre komutaya general joseph l. votel .

this takımdaydı bam .
he blue bell , pa . , has grown ; grass hockey sopasını 3 years old when it was first ( twin ablaları drexel this sports ilgileniyormuş ) and joined the national team at age 16 of the team &apos;s best young player .

later , he and many of his teammates , whether he is on the road to came in 2012 .
the next year , a british coach craig parnham has been appointed office , and things began to change .
a change in the &quot; cultural bam , a change in the mental , physical changes , &quot; he said .
it is no longer as in london .
we are completely transformed .

&quot; at the moment it is a good parnham yerdeyiz , &quot; he said , however , that this is how good it is depends on the outcome of saturday &apos;s match .
the olympic hırsının ortasında trambolin dinginliği
if you are , regardless of how many hours of the olympics is under way .
events will take place in rio de janeiro , the ambitions of a competition and represents the work and it &apos;s as if , like kaçınılamayacak or ever will .
the olympic torch will pass through swimmers who himself , then delivered a jimnastikçiye triatloncuya alevli such as baton .
simone biles , katie ledecky , or michael phelps and chad le clos is something about the bickering between izleyemiyor duymadan television , newspapers or in a café prefecture komşunuzun veremiyorsunuz listen to what we have .
and there are also the logan dooley .
mr dooley who participated in the olympics for the first time , and always make you feel good sponsorluklar öğütleyen tv ads include a swimmer , a gymnast or a fencer gamzeli yumağı shot like a heart attack , may be one of several names for the prime time hours .
however , in lake forest , california , mr. dooley ( 28 ) in the fight for the gold medal at the olympics trambolinde .
the olympic alevi aydınlatmıyor equal level each event .
away from the centre , in part shade , which is not recognised as a universal sports : air rifle atıcılığı , archery , badminton , taekwondo .
metre breaststroke will always be with us , it should be with in a long time .
however , as a personal best sevdiğimi belirtmem if necessary , i would like to draw attention to the secret büyüsüne trambolinin .
so trambolin during the sydney games , an olympic event since 2000 , though it is known as the 16 years sorduğum very few people , it will be an olympic sport varmamıştı is aware of it .
this could be a regional ignorance .
the united states of america , the competition for the athletes it sends trambolinde no medals , and rising to the finals until 2012 , there has never been a contestant .
the men &apos;s competition for the chinese and the russians , the chinese and to share for males and kanadalılar eğilimindeydi .
china &apos;s dong dong and rosie maclennan from canada in london this year , they will work to protect the gold medals .
however , as an event is dubbed mazlum trambolin notes ; this is in part because of the olympics , rather than be caught unaware kulaklarda palyaço düşünülmesi school that may be awarded .
etmeliyim expert here that i am not guilty , there is the only issue i have .
there is the potential for a funny ( never sonlanmayan sıçramanın created cartoon , like other titreme ) together , however , is essentially two sports , gymnastics and also reflects dalışın zarafetini .
&quot; &quot; trambolin , spanish al trampolin kelimesinden is coming ; this is the meaning of &quot; is &quot; is the springboard .
the champion of a major aerial trambolinde candidates almost 30 feet high jumps and by the time they turned over to a series of action ( burkma , pike and salto ) to do it .
according to the official olympic programme of the executive , the challenge and the amount of flying , &quot; according to the &quot; değerlendiriliyorlar .
rio in 17 countries in the 16 men , 16 women , including two athletes will compete in three decades .
one of the most frequently seen in the olympics is directly to the ones that are moving forward .
umanlar to receive the medal , gold seek end to the point of , in some cases , forward and back , in some cases , more or less is more downward movements away , faster and more çıkmalı more or less .
only the end of the line at the wall , or in the beginning , they were not pursued , the magazine that on tv at the same time , there is another difficult line ; the world or olympic record .
this ambitious effort is noble , imrenilesi and even the extreme levels ; even the one whom gözyaşlarına boğmak enough for .
but that is exactly what i had the games , and the slightly exhausting özelliklerden .
trambolin , all of them at one point verebilmenizi .
the trambolindekiler more or less accurate .
for it is not the movement forward .
more or less in the right sıçrar , astronaut weightlessness as it appeared more or less interest , and the iner zahmetsizce down more or less interest .
of course , there is no competition or challenge during the routine , however , a trend seen in order to achieve the outcome , there is no away from the disappearances , just imagine çekiminin , such as the time and place , in a way , were suspended .
how an olympic race was so dingin dingin olabilirse .
women have , and then the finals friday afternoon in 13.00 düzenlenecektir east saatiyle ; men &apos;s on saturday , again on the 13th .
nbc every two days , in the finals in the afternoon as the bloc is due to release from 14.00 .
in the middle of the olympic çılgınlığının exactly , general neglect , in the quiet and as soon as i can be a great promise .
and the awareness of the wall street journal , according to the united states of america &apos;s men , as proposed by jimnastikçilerinin shortly before , only for the eye süzmek and nesneleştirmek male athletes by offering artacaksa , mr. dooley &apos;s new fans can say he expects .
for a long time ally of the united states in ethiopia , &quot; one generation &quot; protest
in ethiopia İçeren protestolar violence
in ethiopia , the protesters demanding political change , the government &apos;s violent revealed .
Şahitler , a large number of protesters and police and another deadly weapons that hits , he says .
in ethiopia crumbling ?
in the past decade , africa &apos;s is one of the most stable uluslarından and rapidly growing economy and a sound for the western allies .
in recent months , however , the anti-government protests , more and more every day , the fire spread to the region has left the country .
just last week , thousands of people were out in the streets , and called for a fundamental political change .
according to human rights groups , the government &apos;s response to it is quite acımasızdı .
Şahitler , a large number of police officers and the killing of unarmed demonstrators has , he said .
late last year or early this year , thought to be footage from the protest , his hands against a wall to stand dayayıp kırbaçlayan forced young people , security officials in the city .
the most senior united nations human rights official at the moment is asking for a thorough review .
a research group , the international crisis group , the project director of the somalia rashid abdi , a &quot; in this country , it was hard to keep any time , and there will be much more difficult to move forward , &quot; he said .
ethiopia , nigeria , africa &apos;s population is the highest uluslarındandır and stability is appreciated by the west .
the american military and intelligence services , particularly in somalia , as well as for the fight against terrorist threats in the region , and work closely with the etiyopyalılar reason and in africa from the west , how can it be that there is very little assistance from the view of the country .
ethiopia &apos;s economy is aggravated because currently in a way that impressive .
the infrastructure is effectively iyileştirilmiştir ; in the capital , addis ababa , even if there is a new commuter train .
and in the streets , in the usually quiet , safe and temizdir .
each of how ethiopia &apos;s is the best example of democracy in the sergilenmese ( human rights groups have repeatedly referred to the government &apos;s repressive stance of opposition within the country , there are quite sınırlıydı ) , susturulmaktaydı opponents effectively .
most of them were sent into exile , were thrown in jail , or were killed in the most remote köşelerine çölün said .
it may be , however , that is about to change .
in central ethiopia , a university professor , seyoum teshome , &quot; she and the other option for them were boğar sunmazsanız , &quot; demiştir these events of interest .
if the youth is completely protest .
in a generation of protest .
the land use pressures on the ruling coalition &apos;s strength as many complaints about the current .
last year , in the wake of the election , which is quite critical of the ruling party and its allies , among the last in the post , and they no longer control 100 per cent of the parliament .
at the same time , in june , hundreds of people were killed in the war that led to the provocative and contentious line tensions on the border with eritrea , which is also on the rise .
analysts say the oromo freedom front or the ogaden national freedom front , as well as the separatist groups in the last several years , removing the shield this türbülanstan silahlanmasından fears , took the opportunity to again .
for several years , suffering under the yüzeyin kaynamakta why raise it now , there are a few factors patlamakta is about .
firstly , it seems to be innocent : smart telefonlar .
cheap smart telefonlar yaygınlaştıkça sağlandıkça and internet service , only a few years ago , a large number of ethiopian began using social media to communicate .
the government , especially in times of protest , as it is often said that access to facebook and twitter , in their positions , even if most people who planned kapattığında caretaker kurabiliyordu communicate via the internet servers .
a couple of young ethiopian , toplandıklarını in this way for the protests , he said .
secondly , ethiopia &apos;s two largest ethnic group , and the solidarity between the oromolar amharalar has also increased .
is not normally oromolar and amharalar ally .

appearance on donald trump , obama &apos;s promise to set up in the iŞİd İddiasını announces &quot; as &quot; alaycılık
donald j. trump , on friday , a few times last week to insist that president obama and hillary clinton &apos;s founders &quot; of the islamic state terror group , &quot; while arguing that there was no serious campaign has sought to eliminate the last conflict surrounding it .
these statements , the republican candidate for vice president , made it clear to the american people and the ability to communicate gives birth to new questions about it .
at the same time , it is in the process of this chaos do all it can to defend vekillerini who is also implied that there is no evidence that the process worked , thanks to unveil a strange position .
mr. trump , on wednesday night at a rally on thursday , after being this önermede tezini further kuvvetlendirerek interviews he and mrs clinton &apos;s iŞİd implied that because she &apos;s really on .
however , in the early hours of the morning on friday via twitter that gönderide , mr. trump , there is only the testimony of a cynical , he said .

the conservative hugh hewitt radio programcısı , mr. obama wants to destroy iŞİd , recalling mr. trump &apos;s efforts to help him with the comment yumuşatmasında denediğinde , said he does not believe that the republican presidential candidates .
mr. trump , in the wake of the plunge in the latest tangle trying to change the focus away from the campaign .
mr trump and mrs clinton , in michigan this week with conflicting speeches on the economy .
on friday , mr. trump has asked to return to this issue again .
via twitter , again by talking to mrs clinton &apos;s speech , and that he would increase taxes tekliflerinin found boring , he said .
mr. trump alaycılık before in his defence .
in late july , the russians to mrs clinton &apos;s e-mails from a pirate attack was to look after the big criticism after the karşılaştıktan has demonstrated , these comments , &quot; of course , i do so far , &quot; he said .
this approach , mr. trump &apos;s political speech of zorlamasını and had to step back to the city .
the language used by both candidates in the following ruth sherman , a communications expert , &quot; it is certain that the messages he sees how to respond to him by supporters of testing , and in a way that , depending on the reaction of the &quot; to do &quot; in a statement that , &quot; he said .
at the same time , however , it can deliberately and that when it comes to the different merceklerden filtrelenecek knows that it is uncertain .
recently , mr. trump in the polls after the general election , instead of to the air for the audience is much more aggressive position .
published on friday , a new nbc / wall street journal / marist survey , mr. trump &apos;s north coraline , virginia and colorado , mrs clinton &apos;s is quite far behind , and a tight race in florida showed that in the current .
so mr. trump usually an apology for saying provocative things dilemekten kaçınsa saptırmakla eleştirenleri itself in the words or mizahını anlamamakla response .
in the last months of his presidential campaign , however , is much more exposed to the scrutiny of mr. trump &apos;s şakaları , interpretations of how provocative , even though it rests on the support of his loyal supporters to the cold .

in a sense , obama before iŞİd unknown , a small kuruluştu , lovely convent bulanlar hatalıydı them completely , and the withdrawal of troops from iraq because of this .
by most of the republican , mrs clinton &apos;s foreign ministry said that the obama administration , with the situation in the middle east in a way that failed to cope with aggressive and that &apos;s why the rise of iŞİd is trying to defend it .
on friday , ahead of the rallies will be held in pennsylvania , trump via twitter , the news media each term çarpıtmak and biased against him on charge continues .
&quot; working to resolve itself zavallı , acınası &quot; tv experts &quot; they no longer have to do that ! &quot; he said .
some of the democrats , put forward by mr trump &apos;s bahaneyle itself was elected to it is that there is no evidence that it was appropriate , he said .

hussein gülerce : gulen &apos;s fall on the collapse of 3 ayağın
commenting on the coup attempt of the fetÖ hussein gülerce sensational statements .
hussein gülerce satır early in the statements said :
i like when the coup kalkışacakları this issue in the last 5 or 6 months , &quot; yazılarımda could attempt , but they no longer within the chain of command , &quot; i said .
bilemedim two things ; firstly that competitors will be widespread and deep , for instance , the general commander of the gendarmerie &apos;s 8th annual chain of officer and mr. president &apos;s yaverleri .
mr. president , who is fighting the most people , has noted how the able yaverlerini chose , but the most important characteristic of an unprecedented privacy .
much two yüzlüler .
&quot; this is a retired , such as fetÖ vaizin can do is not the work of one of the most important kanıtlarından said , &quot; so it should be a deep kumpas .
will come from the cia &apos;s support .
the cia , it does not take hands too early .
mahmut Övür says that in 2014 , in 1971 vehbi koc at his home in the east and the fetullah gulen discussed the fuat .
then most of these people are interested in jobs in the relations between mit and the cia as the most is close to the presidency , he says .
our staff &apos;s salary from the armed forces of the united states has already been paid , hatırlamadıktan after them , one man like that , it said .
we do it when we learn , in 2014 .
mahmut bey &apos;s takes later , issued a statement denying that it was not in .
for instance , adil orphans , the base was caught ?
this added kimdir wonder .
the man in the last 25 days before the coup pensilvanya heading to 2 times , 2 days ago .
fair orphans since 2002 , went abroad in search of 109 times .
all the time to raise them together , it is necessary to start this ; at the moment , all the fetullah gulen kaçanların went to the united states starting in march 1999 , a hangileri bahaneyle when in the united states , it needs to start .
will be seen , however , is an opportunity to pensilvanya gitmişlerdir .
but the cia can be identified with the real irtibatları şuradan ; raising the necessary people , especially from within the police to be sent to the united states in a very human .
there is a wikileaks documents ; gulen kurduruyor an association with the cia and that the association is in joint meetings .
it was 15 years ago , with links to the cia resmiyette studies to show that he is made of .
fuat avni pensilvanya &apos;s is an intelligence havuzudur demiştim i was 2 years ago .
the man who worked in the prime minister &apos;s fuat avni is trying to join .
but the bad thing is ; this information , such as when pensilvanya , the cia also fell .
gulen &apos;s depends on the demolition of three ayağın collapse ; it is just one of the base , but the link in the inactive friends , there are those who are deeply hipnozda iyice , this is still not even attempt a coup , erdogan &apos;s film , they say .
i always said to the three leg , a support base .
questions about the theft , burglary , the defeat of the right to kul , this support base is very hard .
the other two foot ; the political support , international support .
the international support is still available .
which is the only thing that he did for political support , and the mhp deputies kasetlerinin fetÖ çekildiğinin documentation by managers .
&quot; after the july 15th , &quot; fetÖ also use help mr. kilicdaroglu , has opened everyone &apos;s eyes .

at least educated , former football player he
this balance bozansa , less educated , the former football player of turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan &apos;s populist , has led to a large extent İslâmcılar devout , an entrepreneur from the fetullah gulen &apos;s texas in the city of tashkent , the more than 1,000 schools , universities and educational institutes which scores of highly educated takipçilerinin ittifakıydı winners .
call , foreign policy reported last week in a loss makaledeki cümlenin .
erdogan &apos;s university degrees , which is the least educated and the former football player ; elementary education , gulen is a broad ufku entrepreneur that describes the gulen müridlerinin made it clear he produced these and other articles in the western media often .
i learned that on the other hand , &quot; why in turkey , america and / or the west stems go up ? , &quot; erdogan said in the article appearing Çünkü ... cümlelerle began , trying to explain it .
his opposition to the west in turkey , erdogan &apos;s era as a situation that nevzuhur analysts think that it is unaware of turkey as soon as possible .
in fact , according to the statistics , the erdogan era in the first decade of the decline of western karşıtlığının in turkey , where on average , or the as a period .
in the ten years since it is in the european union and the united states of america also has good relations with the sürmekteydi synchronised manner .
erdogan &apos;s &apos; one minute and , in his criticism of israel , because of the assad regime in syria as a result of the massacres after the civil war broke out in the eu &apos;s policy to emerge with a clear koyamaması and refugee crisis in turkey to leave , some , such as the european parliament president schulz , &quot; not &quot; figürlerin erdogan muhatabımız üstenci attitude as , in the uk , swearing at the opening of the contest to erdogan , and then the london mayor , şimdinin foreign minister &apos;s frustration over an eight edemeyeceğiniz iğrençlikteki lines will run through to win in turkey , the pkk , which entered the country from syria &apos; live grenades are whether our citizens are katlederken , the pkk &apos;s syrian branch , the ypg in europe , both in the office of both exhibitions açtırılarak yüceltilmesi , us troops who served in syria ypg armalı uniforms giymeleri , daeŞ and brett mcgurk , special representative in charge of fighting in the ypg private visits to the location , such as a threat to the ypg to turkey as the only opposition groups defended the citizens of all the informational and logistical support to the ypg towards , on the other hand , turkey &apos;s struggle with daeŞ küçümsenmesi and even mosul , as in the united states support and pressure from the administration of baghdad and the reduction of the unit sayımızın and similar to many why yields .
hadi , the result of a bloody coup that we lost 247 insanımızı , so our ally , the eu countries and the united states by the failure of the coup kanıtlanana demokrasimize gelmeyişini no support , kerry &apos;s speech , the first to initiate peace and stability in turkey , they expect in the building of democracy , and none of the elected government on yapmayışını unuttuk diyelim .
but what about the charlie hebdo in paris , 11 workers were killed in turkey , including many of the world leaders who participated in the protest march for democracy , but tanklara order 247 people were killed , a month after the coup attempt to turkey in the past , though , is that any western allies in the country and how it should be for any head unutulacak ?
for the refugee issue from a few times a year başkanların or senior representatives from sending representatives to the lower rates of yollayanların will say what ?
all were broken , the daily hurriyet camı ambassadors from the eu and the united states in the past , regardless of whether they go to visit , turkey &apos;s general assembly on how to evaluate a solidarity visit bulunmamalarını ?
when it comes to the coup in egypt in the first two weeks , the eu &apos;s high representative yollayarak sıkıştığı stays with the leader of the coup , during his visit to kerry in the aftermath of the coup , democracy is being rebuilt , adding the coup leadership yücelttiği hatırlanırsa , turkey is no longer imtina direnişinde support for democracy in the western countries , who at every opportunity they meet turkey demokrasisinden kaygılandıklarını expressed sincere in turkey is the lack of a very unnatural ?
hâlbuki 95 % of the public as a coup for the gulen , who lived freely in the united states at the moment , even to allow the turkish people are outraged .
the above background that the plan is also a eklenirse , i think i was just emerging from the western / american karşıtlığının açıklanamayacak with erdogan is a situation is clear .
furthermore , he is currently darbede effect of the united states is not even he thinks he can ...
this means that the polling never teferruat wasn &apos;t
the small view of its own people , &quot; he said , &quot; voting teferruattır , voters who like himself as &quot; ignorant &quot; karnını kaşıyan aşağılayan travel zekalılar , 15 july night and then wonder whether the same telden çalabiliyorlar ?
the people of this state and how to have a democracy , and that is where &quot; we are the answer to the question of &quot; yanıldık aramışlar behavior ?
but the answer to so many of the questions that need to be found ?
düne , a traitor , who served in various kademelerde until the state &apos;s right to use their weapons to them and the officers , a &quot; traitor &quot; to the status of how the moment seemed to enter the asylum istemişlerdir and foreign states .
how we live in a mental çarpıklık environment , and how people were looking takıntıların sapıklık nitelenecek davranışlara then directed as well .
... when it comes to sulanmış beyinler to initiative
for the participants in this action to turkey &apos;s cities of syria &apos;s cities has a benzetmekten further than the alternative ?
why should an officer of his country &apos;s parliament of their own bombs ?
with the fetÖ bedduaları sulanmış beyinlerden , waiting in line with that kind of behaviour yanılgıya düşmemeliydik herself said .
on the other are not responsible for everything , but bilelim chief is not only the fetÖ .
in politics , and that hate is also offering kadrolar as a profession , it is necessary to yapmışlardır believers .
&quot; aydin , who presented themselves as &quot; aymazlar , in every form of the rule , and even the illegal behaviour by audiences inandırmışlardır terbiyesizliğin is natural .
the weapons in the hands of those who hate his own people , this is how the public at verilince açtıklarını at the end we &apos;ve even seen .
the way to democracy , as we know it to
a very simple thing to say : on the evening of july 15 people in turkey , the soldiers inside the fetÖ cü tufeylilere , haramilere , sergerdelere has killed 250 kurtarmaktan and democracy too .
but behind the july 15 , 1992 to 2002 ; in 2002 and 2012 ; in 2012 , and there are three of the era , including the post .
the three time when there are prepared three changes : economic , social , political .
the two major social change created the phenomenon : in the rural areas of migration and the metropole göçerlerin cities around for a very long time to be moved to the centre after being kept .
on wednesday , i have made clear that it is through the subway .
metro they geçmeyin , the most important component of social change , i stressed she also .
the second major change in the same doğrultudaki bridges and yollardır .
modernleşmeye brought about by the road and bridge to more easily understandable .
to income , economic and social structure .
we have a political structure that değiştirmiştir .
this historic duty over the bosphorus in istanbul , i found the köprülerle i have .
demirel , over the bosphorus bridge , which have .
this post of peasant movement in the 1950s doruğuydu in the 1960s .
ozal , the name of the progress in line now as the martyrs bridge on july 15 in the second değiştirdiğimiz köprüyle .
even their road routes çevre- shows the relationship between the central .
that is how it is a sign of social change in the route izlendiğinin .
demirel and ozal &apos;s maksadı eritmekti large audiences at the centre .
the centre &apos;s benimsetmekti its ideology to them .
the third bridge the ak party has done for many years .
because the rate of migration of all have been under way .
people have been coming from the satellite cities .
he is a bit of a closed system that has been created in areas .
the ak party aş people , local governments , business , social status , they will vote for the ak party .
so it is not at the centre -- actions which erimesi , prompted political bilinçlerini edinmesi and then , in the centre of them was asked to come in .
prior to the formation of the ak party urged the ongoing discussions ( 1992 and 2002 ) and alakalıydı .
the debate over the conservative , mütedeyyin and taşralı people side by side , not about bütünleşmeleri durmalarındaki kitlelere has pushed through the obligation .
i made it in the wake of the ak party in 2002 by standing audiences siyasallaştırdı , added to the politics , olgunlaştırdı .
after them , the attention is now baking , 3 . the construction of the bridge of the democratic struggle in the 15 july zamanlıdır co .
this means that , the history and sociology örtüşmüştür .
it is a dimension more ekleyeyim : the ak party &apos;s , a move above is not just limited to the istanbul köprüleriyle .
nothing is more interesting : the ak party is now in the surrounding towns , the centre would bütünleştiriyor .
this is being provided through the two bridges .
a , osmangazi bridge .
the two , at the bridge of canakkale 1915 .
to add to it .
turkey , thrace in izmir , another güzergahtan will reach now .
do you know what this deteriorating , izmir after that , it is no longer a city would be different .
diyelim that the ak party , it does not get inside , from the outside , in izmir , it is no longer in it .
it is no longer the bursa , canakkale now , it is no longer the thracian cities of other human and social coğrafyalara dönüşecektir .

sitting on the control of the asset fund reconstruction
among the world &apos;s largest funds , which are expected to keep silent over the objections of turkey presence fund sedasız was removed from the law require it .
the fund &apos;s lacks the machinery of control due to the fact that it was decided that the discussion again without any changes , however , are discussed .
the akp &apos;s presence in turkey , has been brought in to offer sozcu.com.tr fund for the chp member of parliament and the plan and budget commissioner , writes utku cakirozer , owned by &quot; kamuya varlıklardan , emekçinin , who will be recruited zorunluk pension cuts , the unemployed , the unemployment fund will be collected for this structure , the control mechanisms we stabilise is definitely out , &quot; he said .
the government &apos;s investments and projects in the long term in order to fund the offer by the fund for the presence in turkey , the opposition should also be discussed on tuesday ( shoulders was removed from the law require it .
the akp , however , is the same as it is today , the offer plan and budget commission has brought back .
turkish plan and budget commission &apos;s journey , a member of the member of parliament from the chp , writes utku cakirozer , presence fund for the chp &apos;s concern about the bid , and spoke to the concerns of sozcu.com.tr .
cakirozer said , &quot; this is the establishment of the fund &apos;s plan and budget commission require when it comes within the draft legislation , the chp , which at the beginning of the team &apos;s former finance bakanımız zekeriya temizel , expressed concern and endişelerimizi , require that it be submitted for detailed in the law as the proposed offer , &quot; he said .
the government to accept that view , also pulled out of the bill .
the bill will be the same as it was yesterday , the commission .
&quot; the government has to do it within a week , based on no , &quot; he said .
asset fund code should be a compromise on the break cakirozer said , &quot; our law , this is the largest teklifindeki endişemiz kuralsızlık . &quot;
&quot; owned the assets , emekçinin , who will be recruited zorunluk pension cuts , the unemployment fund for the unemployed will consist of collected revenues , revenues from the privatisation , apart from the control of the parliament and the council of a structure and no kuralsızca devrediliyor without responsibility , &quot; she said .
it was established that such funds from russia , china and the gulf states &apos; oil revenues and business fazlalıkları this way and that the fund financed cakirozer said , &quot; but we have , there is the savings gap . &quot;
therefore , the fund will consist of public sources , meaning that the public parasından .
the unemployment fund , a total of 100 billion , making it the individual employee zorunla 100 billion pension fund , is scheduled to undergo privatisation of 50 billion of the money .
&quot; that is completely in this fund will consist of public money , but the public ones , and the irresponsible harcanmaması need this money , &quot; he said .
as the state &apos;s resources , borçlanmasında assets owned by the state , which is a guarantee fund outside the control of the house , is unacceptable , &quot; stressing that the tutulmasının cakirozer , presence fund code is related to the bid and said their concerns .
the presence of such a large public gathering , that would be better spent on the public in the name of the business and transactions related to the borçlanılmasına , only denetimiyle geçiştirilemez independent audit firms .
it should also be one of public control and transparent , it needs to be a structure .
the law governing the presence fund &apos;s control of the institutions , and there is no provisions on transparency .
how not to limit a aktarılacağı on funding .
no one will be held to account for how this fund kullanıldığıyla soramayacak .
the goal is for the financing of major projects , as well .
aside from the budget for it , where there is no need to establish a fund .

this makes the feasibility of natural response , &quot; why sayıştaş and control of parliament kaçılıyor ? &apos; is the question , &quot; he said .
in the accumulation of wealth fund , they are not against the aktarılmasına investment money , but it &apos;s not transparent , the account is that they are opposed to it , adding that the mechanisms cakirozer said . &quot; there is a need for such a funds can do , &quot; he said .
but if the government is not a ısrarcıysa at that time , it was established that such investment funds , as well as in other countries , in turkey , the current international standards , we must ensure that apply .
will control and accountability mechanism in a way that yapılandırılmalı are met .
there will be no impact on şaibelerin , used his own money to account for their citizens to sonr kuruşuna needs to be set up in a way that will answer for it .
the offer from the fund for the asset , as it is firmly against the commission stressed that their cakirozer , &quot; akp &apos;s , especially in the wake of the july 15 coup attempt to listen to criticism in parliament we are pleased with that , &quot; he said .
it is also offering to the akp &apos;s constructive eleştirilerimize hope you listen to it .
kuralsız used as national assets , to be handed over , it is irresponsible to users and public supervision , though we are against it .
&quot; these concerns , however , the fund for İstenen presence giderilirse may be beneficial , &quot; he said .
those on offer from the opposition between the akp and the work was done to ensure it öğrenildi .
