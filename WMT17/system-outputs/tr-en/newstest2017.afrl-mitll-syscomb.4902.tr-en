assist doctors on strike : calls for new business to slow down
assist the representatives of the doctors in connection with the dispute about a new contract to allow the unions to slow down their business slows on .
the association of british tablets ( bma ) asks doctors committee ( jdc ) has called on the general council to support the action to slow down more business from the beginning of september .
the jdc said ministers had failed to address concerns about the contract .
assist doctors and medical students in the rejection of the contract deal with bma .
this was rejected by 58 % of the members who voted .
in a tweet on twitter on thursday night , the jdc president , knudsen mccourt , stated that the government remained &quot; silent &quot; on the problems caused by the rejection of the contract .
in light of this , he said : &quot; in light of this , the jdc board voted to reject the proposed new contract and called for a resumption of formal negotiations on concerns . &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the jdc board has submitted a formal request to the bma board to allow a programme to slow down business slows from the beginning of september .
the dispute prompted the rebels to join six strikes , including the first total cut in the history of the nation this year .
dr johann malawana , the leader of the rebels in bma , resigned after the bma voted against the terms of the proposed contract .
the 54,000 asstan doctors and medical students voted during the preceding meetings to give bma members of the a good deal that should be considered .
after the vote , the health minister , jeremy hunt , stated that the contract would apply to doctors in great britain .
russia and turkey : a &apos; alignment alliance &apos; ?
this was a gesture that terminated the crisis .
the leaders of russia and turkey met to shake hands on tuesday and announce that the eight months of war with the word and economic sanctions were officially terminated .
but when vladimir putin greeted his turkish counterpart at the crowded hall of the st. petersburg palace , i was obvious impression that ankara was the most of the .
he was , yes .
but mr. putin &apos;s smile was quite weakened , and even against his own limited standards , he cannot be said to have spread any temperature .
unlike several times , , recep tayyip erdogan spoke of his &quot; good friend &quot; mr. putin ; five times , according to a report .
i am surprised by the number .
he also promised that relations with russia will not return to the pre-crisis level , much higher levels .
the next day , a newspaper here said that mr. erdogan had never been acting like a bad thing .
i think he was the opposite of the excitement itself .
but the cold intifada , mr. putin &apos;s shoot showed that the russian leader had not forgotten anything .
in fact , the first thing i mentioned that the opening was the reason for the crisis : the shot of the russian fighter plane on the syrian border .
he was at the time of russia &apos;s response .
mr. putin , a sharp exit , accused ankara of stabbing moscow in the back .
he was a lot of fuss , the opposing side seemed to be friendly .
it will be difficult to truly rebuild , perhaps impossible .
since november , the idea of the people of russia has changed .
the state-controlled media has been targeted for several months and has been targeting ankara in an aggressive way .
suddenly , everything was criminal turks .
the most serious of these was the accusation that senior officials of mr. erdogan &apos;s family profit from illegal oil trade in areas under the control of the so-called islamic state in syria .
he flatly denied it .
but the official message from st. petersburg , however , was that it was time to continue the path .
ultimately , the conclusion of this meeting was that mr. putin had received the apology demanded from the president .
russia can see it as a sort of victory .
ankara is very clear benefits call for a ceasefire for .
but first , he needs friends after the failed coup , which took place last month and which will almost take over .
the terrorist attacks in turkey .
also active in economic reasons .
the sanctions imposed by russia are hard hit ; especially the prohibition of private flights carrying a few million russian tourists to the coastal areas each year .
that number has fallen by almost 90 % .
the tour operators and leasing companies in russia are certainly relieved with the fact that the flights will continue .
at the end of the season in the mediterranean .
and earlier this week , state television predicted a decrease in the prices of fruit and vegetables , with a rebound in the import of turkish agricultural products into the .
&quot; the turists are there , tomatoes are there . &quot;
the visit , however , was also available in a separate political value for moscow .
ankara is angry at the west for failing to find enough response to the coup d &apos;Ã©tat .
the talks on joining the united states have also been added to anger over a long time due to the progress of the countryside , with turkey with the west and seeking to take advantage of the standoff , mr. putin .
the russian leader seems to have gathered sympathy from ankara , certainly due to the call for the support of elected officials following the coup attempt .
not to forget , he himself was carrying a profound fear of regime change for moscow , which was an inevitable position .
this summit , which is the two countries , held at the seaside this crowded palace , represents a &quot; alignment alliance &quot; in russia and turkey , in the way of an analyst tells me : the west refuses and is acting poorly held .
nevertheless , despite this , they are quite different apart from each other .
one of the most important of them is about syria : moscow itself as a mediator , but russia and turkey support different sides .
after almost three hours of initial talks , the two speaker didn &apos;t address this issue at the press conference , as he supports it .
the president has openly avoided answering a question regarding these differences , while mr. putin chose to underline them .
there is no clear consensus on how to set the common ground in syria .
but after months of clear animosity - and that of a member of that russian fighter plane hit and dropped , the potential for absolute disaster exists - at least the two leaders begin to speak , at least in a good development for the .
royal bank of scotland disappears for customers outside of scotland
the rbs brand , according to the chief executive board of the bank , will be in the rear office position of the .
the royal bank of scotland will be destroyed for customers outside of scotland .
ross mcewan said the bbc scotland rbs brand is associated with the global goals of the bank &apos;s .
almost west of the state eight years ago , to withdraw them and to give up .
during this time , brand strategy experts used rbs to protect other consumer financial brands .
this was supported by millions of pounds for many sponsors from the six nation ragbi champions , wimbledon andy murray championships .
but now , however , the more national brands will be right .
the royal bank of scotland will be used by scottish customers but there will not be able to do new beginnings .
the centre and the welsh centre and the stock exchange on the condition that all references to rbs will be replaced as natwest .
already used in the ulster bank brand for customers in the republic of ireland and northern ireland .
there are smaller brands will assume a much more dominant task for individual banking ; coutts , adam &amp; co . , drummond and holt &apos;s military bank .
mr mcewan was interviewed in a round of for customers and staff in inverness-shire .
speaking to bbc scotland told bbc scotland , he said : &quot; after that we will now become a bank consisting mainly of brands , we will no longer be brand investors and our staff will not be in the rbs brand , employed . &quot;
since the bank itself has become a global brand , rbs has become a global brand .
i &apos;m not global now , but i say it &apos;s local goals .
also , each of these brands will be put forward in a slightly different way on the community , and our staff will work under the name of these brands with customers .
rbs will not continue sponsoring the six nation championships , and it is time to are raising the profile of the different brands on sports sponsorship .
&quot; now the brands have time to move to understanding the bank because ( we have asked ourselves ) how can a better bank do it for customers , &quot; said the executive board .
three years ago , we will be a wonderful bank for customers and we have stated that we will offer these brands to those who will find it .
through our work , however , and not our own , i think you will see too many changes with the focus on the needs of customers .
we can reactivate these brands , so it is for this reason that i think this is the right time .

detail of the double success in newmarket with the victory of 3000th after the champagne exploded
jodie frankie dettori won the 3000th victory in britain on friday , in the newmarket .
the local track , trained by john gosden , won his second victory of the night with the of this milestone .
italian , 45-year-old , was the sixth rider to reach this milestone in the disabled run .
he was followed by the traces of himself , gordon richards , zug smith , lester piggott , pat eddery and willie at last .
jodie , who had previously won three titles in ghayyar , said : &quot; this is a special situation . &quot;
i &apos;m very emotional because it is here in my family
i was really very happy to be on the newmarket when i started this 30 years ago .
this is not an important meeting , not a royal ascot - with just 20,000 people on an ordinary friday night .
i feel at ease , and relieved .
detectives , following the victory , the cheers after of the
disabled runners became the first to reach this milestone in two jets : champion joins richard johnson and 20 time champion , and with a record of over 4300 victories in his career , retired jokey sally anthony mccoy .
lester piggott , who won the derby race nine times in his career , has a 4493 victory .
frankie is one of the best comics of our age , and it &apos;s not surprising that he reached a milestone when he was only a few people before him .
style is the owner and a strong person , but the scales have the element that is heavier than others in the tactical mentality .
he himself represents an extraordinary way of racing , in this regard , to recognize the excitement and darkness of people with this sport .
a few weeks ago , i was told that i could have reached the 6000th victory if i were in the just on weekends and competing in big races .
seriously , to be serious , frankie competed in the united kingdom with a big part of the 30 year victories that it was very nice to see it .
he is quite a character himself , and this is a very good feature for british racing but beyond that it is an extraordinary feat .

this is a full of ups and downs , was on its way .
in 1996 , he won several major races , including the famous &apos; great yin &apos; victory , but was alive in a plane crash and was banned due to failure to comply with the drug ban on the .
three years ago he showed that he had in the process of these six months , particularly during the course of those who suspected him to be unfair and needed to return to the best of a strong character .
and may continue for a while ; dettori previously said he wanted to continue the contest until at least 50 , said .
russia &apos;s putin , special had sergei ivanov dismissed the
the president vladimir putin , special had sergei ivanov unexpectedly dismissed the .
mr. ivanov , mr. putin &apos;s trusted for many years , was part of the close environment .
63 , now as special representative for environmental and transportation issues .
in a statement , the kremlin said in a statement that mr. putin &quot; made the decision to end ivanov as chief of the administration of russia &quot; but did not give any reason .
for this position to mr. ivanov since 2012 , anton vaino .
vaino , 44 years old , is a former diplomat .
he was born in tallinn , the capital of estonia in 1972 , graduated from the renowned moscow state institute of international relations ( mgimo ) and served in the embassy of tokyo underground .
he later became interested in the administration of the presidential protocol and government personnel ; the wording of the kremlin website is in this shape ( russian ) .
after the deployment , mr. putin said : &quot; thank you for your trust in me . &quot;
i think that the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as the head of the state in terms of auditing the implementation of the law and the implementation of the .
mr. putin said friday he wanted the removal of mr. ivanov from the russian television station and proposed to mr. vaino instead .
smile convincing ?
this is a move that shocked moscow .
sergei ivanov , for a long time , was working as one of vladimir putin &apos;s closest allies and , like him , the security forces of the kgb .
especially as he was one of the most powerful people in the country .
during a meeting with putin and aired on state television , both said they had voluntarily dismissed the special stay .
despite the smiling parts given to the cameras , however , very few people here are convinced of it ; especially at this time of the parliamentary elections are .
this a kind of ruling struggle is a dispute ?
no one knows about it yet .
the official statement , however , was greeted with great suspicion that a person could be president to direct russia &apos;s environmental policy .
according to excerpts from the kremlin website , mr. ivanov added : &quot; in a speech in early 2012 , you can say this is tough - even problematic - i wanted you to count on me for four years for the task .
well , apparently , four years , eight months , i served as the head private .
mr. ivanov assumed this post in december 2011 .
he was formerly deputy prime minister and defence ministry positions .
himself , a member of the security council and former member of the kgb state security forces , such as mr. putin .
at the end of the 1990s , mr. putin was replaced by the kgb , the head of the federal security forces ( fsb ) , while mr. ivanov was acting him .
when mr. putin came to power , ivanov was shown as one of the five most trusted people .
mr. putin also presided over the third period in which it was unconstitutional that mr. ivanov might be president after the second term in .
however , his task was transferred to another close ally , dmitry medvedev .
mr. putin became prime minister before returning to the presidency three and a half years later .

fife queens @ @ ferry pass pass : the bridge is now conditioned to
the project , worth Â£ 1.35 billion , must be completed by may 2017
engineers have joined the north and the of the northwest territories ; this means that the bridge is now tied to fife .
this is the first of the four shutters between the &quot; cylinders &quot; of the bridge , which is to be completed around each of the three towers .
the bridge is cut from fife 600 metres long and weigh 30,000 tonnes .
10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 support cables .
the project , worth Â£ 1.35 billion , must be completed by may 2017 .
economy minister keith brown visited the facilities today , one of the first people to walk from the land bridge .
he said : &quot; this is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the northwest passage .
we are all proud of the fact that this project , which is used for the construction of this part of the bridge , is on the scale engineers of a truly epic scale .
maintaining the gap between the base of the bridge and the base of the bridge , despite the extraordinary size and weight of the bridge , is a sensitive work that requires very delicate tolerance for this adjustment .
in general , almost 79 % of the total bridge paintings have been settled , meaning that the first cut of the coffin will be carried out in the concrete washroom today , which means that the entire plate will be ready to be removed on the bridge .
michael martin , director of forth crossing and bridge developers project , said : &quot; all bridge projects , the first closing is always an important milestone .
this extraordinary project , this closing represents the predecessors of construction engineers .
we had to close the gap on the north-or-side of the road , which was also placed on the last road base and after the widening north tower level .
in the north , this was carried out to the south by 700 millimetres .
this is very large but , at the same time , it was a very sensitive function .
the major reason is that the vulture is 222 metres long , weighing almost 6,000 tons and was required to pull out about 3 % .
the reason for the is that the delicate part of the team was very low ; it was only a few millimetres on both sides .
fortunately , everything went on to the .
moelfre gulf rescue team : three men are lucky to be alive in
the three men were &quot; lucky to be alive &quot; after they fall from the fishing boat in anglesey .
moelfre rnli watchdogs were on alert at 13 : 20 a.m. on friday , after the battery station was in the gulf of moelfre .
the three men were striving to swim towards a safe area while their craft remained on its own .
&quot; we have seen the boat draw the right apartments of , and we have anxiety , &quot; said moelfre watchman .

a precious hunting strain for health and happiness , pokÃ©mon go
it &apos;s really a shock to see how the world has changed .
when young people and children are no longer playing out for the game , preferring to spend their empty time on the screen , most people feel sorry for the last ten years .
the pokemon go people are encouraged to move up from the wings .
the time spent by looking at the screen , especially when they were limited to television , eventually video games and finally spread up to the the smart phones spread to them .
for that reason , it &apos;s really great to see that there are no elements that exclude each other in technology and open air , .
in the course of the 90 &apos;s , of course , i was talking about pokÃ©mon go , which was originally created for the video game ( then turned into cartoon series , game cards and other side products ) .
just like a lot of the popular culture , this new game was introduced in early july when it was presented in the us , australia and new zealand .
i then postponed the presentation in other countries due to the intense interest caused by overloading the servers .
in the days pokÃ©mon go tinder more and more and almost the same number of users with twitter .
how does it work ?
to explain briefly , the players are taking smart phones , followed with gps in the way they look for pokÃ©mon , and can upload a photo of the ( by phone ) or catch them in . &apos;
the game can be traced back to the search for a generation who has participated in this madness .
in the united states , the game has provided a remarkable increase in the number of steps taken each day by an &quot; average &quot; person .
the application , which was developed for apple watch , and which was developed for 375,000 users , was introduced in the washington post shortly before the game was presented to people trailing within two days of exercise 30 days of each day , from 45 percent to 53 percent , the person said .
the company does not know who pokÃ©mon go plays ; you can only see crude data at the level of exercise .
the most public health campaign , which encourages people to &quot; disappear from the blood of 30 minutes , &quot; and &quot; to be active every day , &quot; most public health campaigners ignore the fact that most public health messages are boring and have to be forwarded by people who seem to be overwhelmed by the .
but it &apos;s still , to the importance of exercises rather than less .
regular exercise , people who are suffering from cancer or depression is reduced .
the exercise , weight control , high blood pressure and diabetes can help on issues such as diabetes , and so cannot be listed here , has a long list of benefits that cannot be .
pokÃ©mon go &apos;s beauty of the , however , is that people come out to do something they enjoy .
in this way the health is covered in three essential elements : movement , clean air , and entertainment with sunlight .
some people can even be new friends during hunting .
as usual , there are those without walls searching for something to complain about is also present .
and , of course , one can hit the pavement .
what makes the difference ?
presented a great innovation was .
fitflex is watching our offensive smart phone applications like this , but did not offer us a reason to exercise like this game .
the impact of defeat and use will eventually be reduced over time .
however , due to the success of pokÃ©mon , practices and virtual reality combine with activities in the real world that are more active , form and healthy than those will be introduced to help in the .

police : serial killer case of 3 victims , shot while listening to music in the car
phoenix &apos;s first serial killer case in the ten years , two women and a 12-year-old girl , spoke in the car on thursday , according to police reports released , and was shot while listening to music .
the officials said angela rochelle liner , stefanie r. ellis and ellis , the daughter of maleah , had been shot in the car on the way to a garage on june 12 .
the report said the armed man was standing on the passenger side of the car and had fired eight shots with the pistol and another vehicle away from the .
police say these three murders did not appear to be robbery because the aggressive adult victims had no money in their handbag or $ 2,900 .
deputy commissioner jonathan howard , a spokesman for phoenix police , said the armed attack researchers were directed to examine whether this was linked to the previous four attacks .
four months in total , seven people were killed and two others wounded in nine attacks , mainly in the neighborhood of spanish origin .
howard said at the beginning of this month that the cbs subsidiary kpho was &quot; this in the residential area in front of a house . &quot;
key in the late 1990s , a model of brown nissan was thought to have been driven by a few vehicles , including a model black bmw and a white cadillac or of the late 1990s .
the researchers declined to reveal the evidence , which concluded that the attacks were related to the same killer and that it was carried out by the same killer .
ellis ( 33 ) was taken to hospital because of his injuries and subsequently died in the .
liner ( 31 ) and ellis &apos;s daughter , maleah , died at the scene .
the man who appeared on the incident , said he was not a regular offline situation of the car listening to the police . &quot;

the researchers found those bullets , a bullet from a couch , and also bullet holes in the engine .

unlike most of his six year old children , edmund picciuto is also singing , toys and , of course , his mother , too .
unlike his peers , however , edmund exists in the lodge ; this is a genetic disorder that his mother , elizabeth picciuto , is not aware of its existence during the onset of puberty .
when i first came home , my first thought was that i wasn &apos;t going to do it .
i wasn &apos;t able to do that .
i did not want it .
these are not true , of course , but it is also the highlight of the course , &quot; he said .
he and his wife , vincent , were told that edmund could never recognise them and could not even survive .
i went so far as to suggest that some doctors , will be the care home .
picciuto &quot; first reaction was to say that i do not think people are doing it anymore . &quot;
edmund can walk with the help of a walk .
edmund was unable to sit upright until the age of three , or his retirement , and still unable to speak .
but he slowly reaches some turning points .
assistance can walk and ride by bicycle .
he also enjoys playing the game with his two brothers and loves to sing .
elizabeth , edmund , indicates the language of the dreamer , which means &quot; please sing to me . &quot;
picciuto , said to cbs news that &quot; we are taught him the language of the sign language . &quot;
but it &apos;s not the language of the sign , as we know , however , edmund says he has transformed his own signs .
mikroefali may arise due to a number of different situations ; a genetic defect such as edmund may be present in a genetic situation , and during the raw materials , such as the daughter and zika , can be derived from infections .
symptoms and the onset of the disease can show huge differences .

similarly , gabby , and the reason we need to
i got this name from the women &apos;s olympic gymnastics team this year , and there are multiple reasons for this .
first of all , i have joined the summer olympics since 1984 , and the united states has never been so dominant before the .
in the latter : this team has three gymnastics that inspire many girls with different ethnic backgrounds : simone biles , gabby douglas and lauren &quot; laurie . &quot;
the structure of this team , which was brought together by jewish aly raisman and catholic madison kocian , makes everyone proud of the structure .
the team at the end of the day , a similar look to america .
at the same time , it also strengthens the presence of black and latino women at the top levels of this sport .
over the last four years , the first female gymnast has always been an american of african descent .
last year , simone and gabby were ranked 1 and 2nd ranking .
this is a powerful thing .
in the last olympics , gabby douglas was a surprise olympic champion , and america supported him .
now all of the world &apos;s three world champion , simone biles , douglas and laurie , are the ones who could be the only ones to have an unexpected but masters of their veritable gymnastics performance .
on thursday , simone became the fourth american to win the gold medal in the women &apos;s overall assessment .
and teammate aly raisman also won the silver medal .
this is the best time to witness this sport , but the situation in gymnastics courses throughout the country does not seem to be the case .
simone , gabby and laurie followed suit with already and madison in order to get involved in the olympic team .
the reason for the &quot; last courses &quot; is that the next olympic gymnastics team will have only four gymnasts , and it is should be the last year that it will be the for marta karolyi .
in reality , however , gymnastics is a costly sport and gymnasts are primarily paid for by parents , education , travel , the competition , hotel fees ( for coaches , gymnasts and families ) , and many more are supported by private gymnastics clubs .
most of these gymnastics clubs can support these businesses , located in the wealthy suburban neighbourhoods .
these clubs are the only place where gymnasts can receive training and require a long-term commitment to the families and their families of the .
simone biles coach aimee boorman and laurie muller , the defending champion , these athletes have been trained since they began gymnastics .
similarly , we will not offer more reasonably priced and accessible gymnastics training to communities for countless young girls affected by gabby and laurie .
i have my own gymnastics foundation set up 20 years ago .
since the of our agency , in the nostalgic look at over 15,000 young people in the city ( primarily black and hispanic ) , we offer free and low-cost gymnastics training , and we have to both national and international champions .
in september , we will expand to detroit ( where i grew up ) to offer quality gymnastics training to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn about this wonderful olympic sport and take advantage of it .
gymnastics , the strengthening of the body , flexibility and coordination , and mental aspects of hard work , discipline and determination characteristics .
this combination presents long-term advantages for success in terms of health care , at school and in the workplace .
it will be directed to the thousands of young girls , which will be inspired by this team , and this is a wonderful thing .
participation in sports activities is very important , especially for girls .
it &apos;s really exciting time .
simone , already , laurie , gabby and madison took the gold as an olympic team and made it clear to many of their young daughters that they were motivated by their different background plans to become a healthy , strong and successful young woman .
after the rejection of jeremy hunt &apos;s offer , the doctors decided to continue the strike
the ministers hoped that the dispute would end after reaching agreement on the contract developed with the officers of the british taboos union , but 58 per cent of the 37,000 who participated in the vote , the doctor .
in july , mr. hunt announced plans to impose sanctions on the contract , claiming that the nhs is &quot; not the property of anyone , &quot; and that there will be further delays in staff and patients .
the first phase of the physician group was passed into the new contract , which included changes in working practices during the night and late in the week , in order to improve my care outside of normal hours .
dr knudsen mccourt , chairman of the committee of doctors of the bma , said yesterday : &quot; there are still serious concerns in connection with the proposed contract with the doctors ; in particular , it will trigger the current workforce crisis , and that they not all doctors are in an equal position . &quot;
with the passage of the new contract , the first physician group must ensure progress in this process , remaining only eight weeks , and to be full of time .
the efforts to resolve the dispute by talking to bma were met with the government &apos;s unwillingness to interact and , in some cases , with disturbing voices .
this is a development seen in spite of jeremy hunt &apos;s promise that there will always be open to the door last month .
&quot; jeremy hunt is just about to take action , lift my sanctions and listen to the anxieties of the doctors . &quot;
assured doctors are prepared to increase their actions to slow down the business slows if they do not do so .
during the last strike , which took place at the end of april , almost 13.2 thousand routine operations and 100,000 appointment postponed , nurses and consultants were forced to look at instead of doctors in the strike line .
the ministers hoped that the agreement on the contract developed with the officers of the british tablets would end after the dispute is .
bma wants to improve their fees over the weekend for 54,000 asstan doctors , the subject of the contract .
daniel mortimer , executive director of the nhs employers , urged the rebels not to implement any strike .
mr mortimer said : &quot; the strike is not going to solve anything but the pressure on the already busy team and services , creating pressure on the patients , the and their families , would be uncomfortable and cause shortages . &quot;
during the last two months we have continued our discussions with the committee of experts , and together with the ministry of health and other officials , we have a positive approach to the anxieties and concerns associated with the watchdog bullets .
employers are hopeful that the continuation of positive communication in connection with key issues - such as distribution , educational flexibility , training costs for those who break into their careers - is consistent with the agreements reached with the bma in november , february , february and may , a sign that employers have taken seriously what is being taken by the uk medical training , and the department of health ministry .
2 pounds a day can eliminate the danger of heart attack medication
the authorities have proposed granting more people for a longer period of time after thousands of heart attack patients could benefit from the 2 pounds of the expensive drugs a day .
crossing the tracks , the people who have a heart disease , reduce the risk of a repeat of the crisis .
lowering the risk of a heart attack is given over the course of 12 months and can reduce the risk of paralysis or another crisis .
nhs monitors have suggested that it has been given to people for four years , in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems the .
now , however , the nhs , nice has proposed that it be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems , in order .
every year around 140.000 people in the uk every have a heart attack and a quarter of them are suffering from another crisis or paralysis .
the cause of heart crises and is to of the accumulation of fat in the lining of the walls of the .
if the reason why is falling apart , this is caused by the blood clinging to the heart , which could cause cardiac arrest .
and if the tracks , the blood flow is being monitored , and it is in the case of the flow of blood .
those who had previously undergone a crisis are more at risk of having another crisis .
united kingdom firm astrazeneca was created with the name brilique commercial name , reducing the risk of passing the tracks , reducing this risk .
a draft of the nice manual , published today , nice 90 mg of 12 months , and then put in the people of the specialty twice a day for three years , , along with a pneumococcal proposed to implement 60 mg per day .
professor carole longlast , executive director of the nice health technology evaluation centre , said : &quot; effective secondary prevention treatments exist , but as many as a quarter of those who have a heart attack are suffering from another heart attack or paralysis , and usually their results are devastating . &quot;
again , the fear is to be able to have a fairly negative impact on the quality of life of the person .
the evidence shows that the use of justice , along with the vaccine , is effective in reducing the risk of heart attack and paralysis in people who had previously suffered a heart attack .
while we are glad to have increased the treatment options offered to thousands of people who are waiting to take advantage of it .
while more than three years of information about the impact and security of the trade unit -- particularly blood-risk -- is limited , the guide draft no treatment after this term .

he called on council documents and unofficial committees or working groups to better access to the information on the decisions .
&quot; this is not only to protect against fraud in the elections , but also to protect the local government from corruption and financial fraud that the , &quot; he said .
the report was prepared with the instructions of downing street after the concepts were in the wake of the vote scandal in east london .

up to 300 gaming suspects , or the use of fake identification , were the result of voting , such as the head .
sally eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country .
he himself warned about corruption in the , especially in postal voting - where the elderly individuals of the muslim community were pressured to vote for the candidate of their own choosing .
select eric , who is to prove that persons who are in possession of their identity in the manner in which the voting system has made some suggestions for
the contents of the report include testimonies : &quot; there is evidence that some ethnic minority communities , particularly women and young people , have been pressured to vote in accordance with the will of the elderly in their communities of pakistan and bangladesh origin .
&quot; there are concerns that state institutions ignore such behavior due to &quot; political truth &quot; based on excessive sensitivity to ethnicity and religion . &quot;
sally eric has made 50 recommendations for the regulation of the system in the manner in which postal voting documents were blocked in order to &quot; collect votes &quot; of political activists .

&quot; the electoral tribunal has decided that there is no place to charge for repeated allegations of corruption and illegal activities for lutz rahman and his representative , &quot; he said .
himself with a series of grounds beyond reasonable suspicion -- seeing the nature of the criminal evidence - was able to see that .
he also criticised the same time , he found himself &quot; box error checks &quot; that were not effective in the municipal palace &apos;s election registration department .
sally eric said : &quot; one of the concepts was a warning alarm at last year &apos;s court ruling .

the trail is impressive , and at the same time , is something to announce the benefits of .
we finally did a lot of wild brain storm when it came to the idea of &quot; let &apos;s seek ian . &quot;
interest on the health of mice has become a global phenomenon , the claim
i just wanted to put a much bigger context on products rather than talk about products ; everyday we wanted to put in a much greater context of the importance of good and bad bacteria in our environment , the importance of mole health , and it is linked to the immune system .
the interest on health is becoming a global phenomenon , and with this documentary consumers will be able to provide more information in an interesting way in connection with this situation .
at the same time , the film shows that we have a great understanding of humour , i think it !
tom hakala , who runs the film , added : &quot; i have to tell you ; ian , like the disgusting russian toilets shown in the movie , i would have lost my respect against him when he was denied some of the things i want to do . &apos;
naturally it was easy for ian to lick some things naturally , but some were quite difficult .
i am happy that we have made some of these dirty slang acts . &apos;
in a survey conducted by valio in 2015 , 84 per cent of respondents said they believed the bacteria were associated with the health of the mice , and 58 percent said they also used products containing methylic acid , at least intermittent .

one person said : &apos; i don &apos;t care . &apos; 
we &apos;ve been living side by side with them for 20 years , and the situation is always bad .

i highly appreciated the efforts of the members of the community , devon and cornwall police forces and to give us information .

holidaymakers are coming out of the clouds to see what is coming towards them from the noise created by the jet engines in understandable concern over their feet .
the incident occurred in costa nova near aveiro yesterday afternoon .
one of the few who shared the video of the dramatic recent flight on social media , daniel fernandes , said : &apos; i really took the pen twice and appeared to be hit at one point . &apos;

reid indicated that she says that would not give up garland as a candidate for the supreme court if elected
the senatchamber democrats harry reid , the leader of the senate , has said he believes he will nominate judge merrick garland for the supreme court if he is elected president .
the senate is blocking the process of ratification by garland since president obama nominated him in march .
the senate majority leader , mitch mcconnell , said former supreme court judge antonin scalia would choose the new speaker to replace the person who .
reid said in a video thursday that he believes clinton will choose garland and that &quot; there are reasons for this . &quot;
later , a spokesman for reid , speaking on behalf of reid , said he had not spoken with clinton directly about whether he would nominate garland and that he was speculation .
he praised garland himself and said clinton &apos;s team did not want to &quot; spoil the current situation &quot; by making a new election .
garland is the presiding judge of the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia county .
regardless of who is blocking the nomination , reid said the republican vice presidential nominee , donald trump , is &quot; helping &quot; and &quot; paedophiles . &quot;
he said he was not suitable for the task .
treat for women as much as it is for women in favour of a naked calendar , he said ,
treats magazine has been working with photographer david bellemere to publish a timetable designed to be inspired by the pirelli of the 1970s for the year 2017 .
but instead of famous and naked people , they are trying to find a new generation of ball models for the 2017 nu ilham permit calendar .
steve jobs , chief executive of treats , said earlier this year , was that the high rate of license plates was different from that of the old banks of the magazine , because &quot; of the is for men . &quot;
i do this for women .
certain that the schedule believes that is the case .
&quot; men , like the men in the press release on the calendar , should be able to look at this footage of women in the female body as well , so as not to go out of fashion , we must return to the classic plates of fashion , &quot; he said in a press release on the calendar .
women , it is a beautiful piece of art to seek to be a part of this project .
models can send photos online or attend open talks in los angeles and new york .
vinyl target : in reality , who buy the ?
middle aged , is not alone in the men &apos;s cranes .
besides the secrets of our partner , we uncovered amazing insults under our rap section before heading to the comment section to let us say that this is based on real data .
according to yougov , much of the aforementioned issue is the return of the license plates created by a physical object in cash , not the generation of innovation cash , but a result of the middle age nostalgia .
until recently , the vinyl albums purchased mostly between the ages of 45 and 54 .
by contrast , the age group of 18 to 24 is the lowest possibility .
this is also not merely an act of saving the enthusiasts ; it is also an emotional significance ; the older vinyl buyers usually love to hide their feelings ( 56 % and 53 % ) and enjoy being alone ( 69 % and 66 % ) of the .
so what are the results of yougov ?
if this blog were to be aired on television , i would say that if the camera was on a crowded street , with a modest gray number of hands , while crossing the street with a modest gray suit and my hands , they were watching something authoritarian like : &quot; then let &apos;s take a look . &quot;
but then , let &apos;s take an eye .
soon the center of soho is slowly picking up and the unusual mood ( once independent sellers of buildings are now filled with hotels , eats , prets and with hotels , eats , prets and paperback ) is still available in a few specialised garages .
i would probably have to stop from the camera for the next number ; i would try to learn about my aged and emotional condition through observation by standing near the different men in some of these stores .
sister ray ( from the data counting : two young women , three middle-aged man ) reckless record ( data counting : eight middle-aged men , probably 20 years old , followed by a woman ) while i was in london in the afternoon for a meeting , and taking a look at the stores to fill the empty few hours .
asked whether he was a collector .
&quot; i think my , &quot; he says .
about 3000 or 4000 plastics .
the official listed above ( the official sent me the email , with no follow him up to the ) to decorate the walls of the residence , i didn &apos;t .
with so many albums and sets , the reason for the total can be spent , partly as a result of revenue ; it can take the is no longer afford to run out of the money , and can buy back when they sell in times of young and the .
&quot; most of the things i get to are at the beginning of the 60 â² s at the end of the year , when i was 11 or 12 , and i was very young , &quot; he said .
those who love to stay alone , those who buy the company , are likely to be looking for people who are likely to be interested in the idea and adds : &quot; if i smoke , i get a lot of alcohol .
poor adherence to this .
sister ray , who works at wez ( 25 ) , thinks most of his clients have complied with the yougov profile .
but he also noticed that a new wave of youngsters , affected by exaggerated advertising in the media , needs to buy back the old record of those who have come back in this fashion .
during my discussions , i normally overhauled the collections of people in 1998 or 1999 .
they originally sold their vinyl for the purchase of the cd and now sells the cd to get back to the tracks , &quot; he says .
this could explain the increase of certain underage persons who have cranes .
or the alleged emotional significance of the license plates ?
the price of a store is similar to that of people who of similar personality provided a community of relief to a few seconds to notice .
still , according to some of the older customers , the payment system , especially without contacts have been .
while some vinyl enthusiasts may be seeking refuge in the stability of the familiar plygates , reminiscent of the digital world and the recalcitrant youth memories .
wez says ; &quot; sometimes the reason for this is to fill a gap or to see the material items as a kind of comfort . &quot;
i am also a collector myself , and i think this is also the personality of most of the people .
it &apos;s an easy way to fill your head .
when a colleague jumped out of a pile , she said , &quot; social service workers are like that . &quot;
last month , a poll revealed that 50 % of the vinyl album areas had not yet been listening to the album .
at the same time , the the survey also found that 41 % had no use at all , and 7 per cent bought vinyl , even though it didn &apos;t have the record .
looking at this stage of the news , i was probably very anxious to see a series of bossa nova nutrients .
one aspect of this return is the &quot; reward &quot; aspect of sounds in universum ( data counting : three middle aged man ) working at jonny ( 42 ) , which is a factor .
&quot; one soon came to me and said : &quot; i don &apos;t have my record player , but i want to get a radiohead record to put it on our shelves , &quot; he said .
this is a great percentage reflects the current situation is certainly .
more products , less music .
there are people who say : &quot; i don &apos;t have my record player . &quot;
they are not the elderly , but young people , who are at the end of their age , which is the new entry into this issue .
i see that the kittens quite volatile when i arrive at fopp , which is now almost all of a strict set for the .
more than 70 years old , couples , tourists , young boys and middle-aged women .
it is good to see diversity among customers , though the atmosphere above mentioned stores ( the last part of the wild bus ) is less holding-friendly than jazz rather than calming jazz .
none of them seem particularly lonely but it is hard to find solutions to the psychological trauma that makes them by stopping for longer than 30 seconds .
elanora ( 27 ) , a few minutes , in the fopp and taking a look at the plates in the cut .
instead of , it was only to look at the window instead .
he says he has no choice but to record the collection of .
very expensive .
whether it is easier to listen to music or listen to music in other ways , but the beauty of vinegar ... &quot; like the one in the seventies , away from the interior .
i don &apos;t know how to explain , really like the other .
the last stop is said to have inspired a new generation of cranes with a passion for the store : urban outfitters .
dressed as they were looking at them , i observed a group of young daughters gathered around polaroid cameras for a while before the debate on the purchase of a crosley jumper and her daughter .
the left adele , jeff buckley , amy winehouse and fleetwood mac , are in a hurry , filled with the gap ; there is a must for an average collection of ; a mix of modern and classic .
no one is looking at them ; perhaps they are just marvelous , as some are intact too high .
this is a purely &quot; artistic vinyl . &quot;
but if these items , will be , it could mean that the industry has more money and less customers will be sent into the depths of soho ; there are no more issues that can complain .
with more money and time than most of them , which has it &apos;s not surprising that a demographic group is spending more money on more luxurious items , such as vinyl .
but my findings , however , show that yougov &apos;s results are accurate , at least in soho stores ; the number , which is more than the number , is in reality , in stores or online forums or in online forums , who do not take into account their passion of women collector and .
some people are working hard , possibly at school or in offices .
some people certainly do not spend their thursday evening travelling to the in the berwick street , in the store , where they looking at the record and , via the shoulders of middle-aged men , who do not pass through the look of a fake television server 30-year-old .

a french court has rejected the offer of the demolition of shops at manga refugee camp
a court in france rejected the offer by calais officials for the demolition of dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in manga , where thousands of refugees live .
during a court hearing this week , calais officials argued that the state had sold many products from cigarettes to people inside the camp -- the equivalent of 50 cents or 50 cents ( 40p ) for tea or a few euros for a total of 72 makeshift stores sold for basic food .
the calais governors have argued that this is where they should be knocked down because they create an unpaid parallel economy and they are at risk of fire and hygiene and .
assistance to groups , court stores and restaurants is vital , the free food offered by state-sponsored organisations and and other groups is not enough for the growing population in the camp .
the makeshift shops and restaurants have argued that they often homeowners provided shelter and free food to the .
a court in the city , which operates 72 makeshift stores , said it is not a legal anchor for deportation of persons , but the concerns of calais governors were &quot; completely understandable . &quot;
judge jean-francois molla , groceries , cafes and restaurants had , people who live in the &quot; very dangerous conditions , &quot; a much bigger role than just feed , he said .
these areas provided comfortable meeting points for refugees and volunteers , he said .
the book , which is one of the places that is in danger of being torn down , offers a book for children with non-profit , offers 200 meals each day , provides english and french lessons , and here are recommendations on asylum to refugees , hundreds of minors in the camp .
over 170,000 people signed the petition to protect this head , which is for children .
in a letter sent to the guardian , he said this closure would be &quot; a disaster for these children , some of whom are more than eight years old . &quot;
the two charity institutions , serbians and l &apos;auberge des refugees migrants , estimated friday that the number of people in the manga camp , after growing at the of the summer , rose by 9,000 ( the highest number so far ) was the highest in the jungle at the time .
fiji &apos;s , after gold in the class , he was simply a silver medal at the rugby stadium
the dramatic advance of the great britain rugby 7 championship ended in the final after a 4-7 defeat at the rio deodoro stadium on thursday , .
fiji is the first olympic medal in each of the colours to get the gold , but , bypassing , side by side , support , lines and the on the .
after the defeat , great britain received the third silver medal of the day as a consolation prize , and new zealand , argentina and south africa were no longer proud of their efforts in the olympic 7 opening tournament , which they defeated .
at the beginning of the day , they could have found them in the final after the south african team defeated 7-5 in the semifinal .
but still , in such format , it could even beat a team of 15 .
if not very sickness maybe great britain will be able to wear a gold medal tomorrow at least one british legends console : fiji &apos;s top coach , ben ryan , is a british from wimbledon .
this is quite a challenging ride for great britain .
eight years ago , when they worked with ryan at adelaide , they lost every match in the championship .
this time , they lost only one .
but the progress shown in this defeat is really a shock .
fiji has made a fascinating start , with the players , great britain , through their attempts to get the ball .
this blasted tom mitchell and his team for what it was like to run between a series of mobile bus and world servicing champions , the action that took place in the corner of obuispo 5-0 .
in the fourth minute , jerry tuwai left the buffalo with another number .
the game was 12-0 , and great britain almost failed to touch the ball .
mitchell &apos;s wonderful intervention prevented sierra leone nakarawa from taking the third to the mountain , but it was only to delay the number of fiji .
in the seventh minute , jasa veremalua scored the right corner , and great britain fell back 17-0 .
with just one minute left in the end of the first half , nakarawa made a number more from scratch .
as vatemo ravouvou later flew to the line for the number , through some difficult great britain interventions .
between that number , and the scoreboard was 29-0 .
fiji is a established team to play in the 7th championship , while great britain , has not yet trying to learn the foundations of the job .
the situation is more or less the case .
the great recession made major changes and closed the fiji threshold ; for the full four minutes that was a good introduction to the first half , which was a good introduction to josua tuisova until he performed with the perfect fiji game .
dan networked for great britain , and made a try to make the score 36-7 to make it to the left corner of the game , but the game fans sing , waving the flag and dancing in the hands of the south sea adventure .
fiji &apos;s cheerful approach from the beginning was really difficult to avoid .
maa viliame was at the end of the fiji play in the sanctuary viliatame did not need to decorate in the final minutes .
when he was the were stolen , the began the celebration , and great britain ended up in the way to the .
at the beginning of the day , fiji defeated japan 20-5 in the semifinal , a tough semi-final match in great britain , facing south africa ; britain scored a single scoring .
kyle brown suggested the south african team in the first half , but dan netted the top leg movements with the second half with the numbers .
anthony &apos;s brother marcus watson , who took part in the top 15 of england , secured the victory and also secured a silver medal .
helen glover and heather stanning , the coach , inspired the fight against cancer by means of victory on the podium
there won &apos;t be any more emotional gold medals in these games , and that &apos;s a significant meaning .
helen glover and heather stanning , who suffered 220 lashes after the first straw , noticed that they could be much more meaningful than they were in the estacio da lagoa .
although there were two people who had on each podium , there were three voices in the boat ; women in the race were the first women to reach such a level in the uk this year as the first women to advance to the second gold olympic medal in the process were the voice of their coach , robin williams &apos;s .
the judges were quite clear ; this was their unprecedented , undefeated series of 39th race for the .
since we see two wonderful athletes who sticks at the surface of the ice , this does not fully reflect the nature of the victory .
looking behind each rowing gold medal , there was a battalion of keen hands that made this difference , and without any hands , 30 months ago , when he was diagnosed with cancer , he could see this on the day he was not as effective as the coach .
, and , as he was saying .
i was able to the types of cancer that can be interfered with , and made it .
if they do , it goes everywhere .
this would have been a pretty bad situation .
nevertheless , this is changing your look a bit of .
he was identified in december 2013 .
with the exception of the season itself , he was very fortunate to be able to start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , so it is not known whether he would be an accurate expression in such cases but in this way he will be able to minimise the attention crunch .
i was supposed to be able to get payment for this reason quickly .
this was an encouragement for me .
i was able to get to the hospital and say it was enough to take a few steps but the garden was 6 , 9 , 15 metres in the heart .
started in this way .
throwing a ride on its own , but this is followed by a little more markings .
after the victory , he was speaking a bit more than ever to overcome his own concerns when he was in williams , who spent a tense morning .
stanning , who is the captain of the royal guard , and who had previously gone to afghanistan , said , &quot; i was emotionally destroyed this week , maybe this is a bit extreme but from the point of view it is too big . &quot;
i mean , this is what it means for me and helen , me and the bin , once more .
helen and i spent three years with the bin .
if we were in , we must therefore be the best coach in the world because i want to convey my greatest thanks to him .
i wouldn &apos;t be able to find a better person or better coaches for work .
helen glover and heather stanning have not lost the race for five years .
they have reached a difficult rhythm that can be reached by their competitors .
even stanning and glover &apos;s power have not yet been exhausted by the closing of new zealand and the danish teams , .
ourselves that we have lost the main .
the helen he was in the process , in our address .
doors and not going to be really important .
we have done a good start , and we don &apos;t try to do anything incredible .
we did not expect the explosion of fireworks today , we just want to win the race , which is good rowing , which we did in it .
they will have a-year break before deciding what to do in the future .
glover &apos;s wedding is supposed to take place next month ; he and his television adventurer steve backus have been confirmed .
for the time being , i just want to enjoy this .
i didn &apos;t do not want to say that this is my last race .
it would have been a lot of pressure .
i &apos;ve got six months to realise that i am an olympic champion in london , .
this was a lot of beat up , and i was very stress .
here , this is about four minutes .
this is a much better feeling , &quot; he said .

bottom line , &quot; anime &quot; effects were criticised as asian cartoons
bottom line is for this filter to be inspired by the memory of the , but some observers say it is racial sensibility .
bottom line , the tool with around 150 million users every day is changing the authenticity of users to play with their absurdities .
whenever you feel a memory , you can turn the dog or a roy lichtenstein painting into a character .
makers , with over 30 million improved summary filming each day , are reckless , feature changing vehicles .
the misfiring steps , quickly digging into the memory of the public .
snapline makers face charges that they have supported by the black classifieds in the past , or presented their declarations as beauty ideals .
it is for this reason that some critics have criticised the company for adopting a &quot; asian guise &quot; because of the lens and the lens that makes users suffer , due to the lens and the lens that they offer this week .
and i wonder whether these repeat conflicts have pointed to a bigger problem with the diversity of the company &apos;s .
the news and outrage spread with reports of the verge and motherboards on wednesday , and a day after it was announced that snapline had been removed .
in a statement , the company said : &apos; the review was prepared for the anime characters of the , not to be able to .
but for observers who experience of racism , however , these are reminded us of the .
other people have generally rejected the comparison to the anime .

bottom line is not the only company that crosses cultural trigger mechanisms .
the american culture of the meeting of institutions , institutions of hollywood , and the equipment that we all possess is in many areas of diversity and typically in an endless conflict .
and the bottom line is that the diversity of racial diversity is more than that of other opponents of the broad young mass , which may have been interpreted as a higher sensitivity .
in an interview on thursday , katie zhu , 25 , one of the makers of snapline , said that when asked to create a small lowering for a user , &quot; such moves are much more difficult than before . &quot;
on thursday , mrs zhu , a product manager and engineer who works for the medium , decided to delete the account of snapline and call everyone in that direction .
medium he wrote for the article and said in an interview on the phone that he believes that the conflict related to race is reflected in the shortcomings regarding the diversity in recruitment practices .
mrs zhu , the leader of the majority of white men in the company , criticised the article by saying that his team was terminated with a label : &lt; hash &gt; snapex .
&quot; there are different ethnicities among staff or staff who are not able to make such decisions or are working there , and people from different ethnicities do not feel safe or comfortable enough to speak to them , &quot; he said , mrs zhu , an american of china origin .
other observers , said that snapline largely left without answering his views on this complaint .
the company does not share figures regarding the diversity among its staff , stressing the state of the private company .
also on thursday , snapline staff refused to share their racial origin but according to a spokesperson , the company was not recently adequately represented to focus on the population and to include a recruitment responsible for the work as a to improve internally .
mrs zhu said that in her own terms , snapline would keep his the need for account closed , and added , &quot; i wonder if it is more users like us will be able to say that this is not true . &quot;
the intergovernmental panel on congress , military officials , were of the opinion that the destruction of congressional paneli says military officials meet isis drug service
in a report released thursday , a congressional panel reported that the united states attorney general command had falsified intelligence reports to a more optimistic picture of the events on the ground that led to the war against the islamic state in iraq and syria .
a recent report by a working arm of the house armed services committee , the intelligence committee and the defense allowances subcommittee has identified a &quot; widespread dissatisfaction &quot; among intelligence analysts who say their superiors have changed their assessment of the islamic state of america .
centre command , known as centcom , is a military headquarters located in tampa , fla . , and oversees the operations of the american military in the middle east and central asia .
in a news release on the report , the report said : &quot; the intelligence results approved by senior centcom leaders are much more positive than the analysis of the facts on the ground that are typical of us terrorism prevention efforts , and consistently offers much more positive results than the analysis of the other elements of the intelligence community . &quot;
&quot; the ones in centcom are unacceptable ; while poor analysis has been presented to senior decision makers , our warriors are suffering , &quot; california republican representative ken calvert said .
centcom leadership failures have reached the highest levels of the company .
the 10 pages of the report , the centre command statement that the work of training iraqi forces in training and analysis involved , in the details of the permanent problems in 2014 and 2015 , the .
regardless of how , senior obama administration officials have ordered the replacement of the reports , though not the exact evidence that the analysts were in , and also known as dadt , to offer a more optimistic view of the threat created by the centcom leaders to feel the pressure on the .
&quot; in the first half of 2015 , several central komut press bulletins , declarations and congressional statements are significantly more inaccessible than actual events , &quot; the report said .
; for example , a centcom official said a major military attack for the back of mosul could be held as early as april or may 2015 , an official said .
mosul , the second largest city in iraq &apos;s , is still in control of the islamic state .
rep. mike pompeo , the republican representative for cancer , said in a statement that , &quot; after months of research , this clarification has been fairly clear clearly evident in the . &quot;
throughout the middle of 2014 , until the middle of 2015 , the most senior intelligence leaders of the central command of the united states are in iraq , where the threat posed by the military is irrelevant as the commander has manipulated the intelligence results .
the analysts have expressed concern that the intelligence on the islamic state has created a working arm after they .
as it continues , the report , published on thursday , will follow much more comprehensive findings .
the ministry of defence is also present to examine another centcom intelligence , which is being conducted by the inspector general .
the democratic members of the house intelligence committee have also been able to publish their own findings on thursday , who participated in some of the conclusions of the republican working arm .
democratic representative adam b. schiff , the committee &apos;s democratic chairman of the , said in a declaration that &quot; between 2014 and 2015 , centcom , dadt , and the iraqi security forces have been very narrow in their intelligence assessments of . &quot;
according to mr. schiff , this process &quot; delayed the publication of the intelligence results , &quot; causing a moral disorder among analysts , and &quot; did not adequately include opposing opinions . &quot;
however , mr. schiff and the democrats have said that they have not reached a finding that the white house has put pressure on centcom analysts to &quot; advance or a political explaining of the results of the . &quot;
preliminary results of the review of the congress have been announced by the daily bachelor on tuesday .
last august , the new york times reported that a pentagon inspector general review was available following complaints made by centcom analysts .
senior lieutenant commander patrick evans , a pentagon spokesman , said the inspector general was continuing to examine the inspector general in the process that the defense ministry would not comment on the congressional report .
however , he said , &quot; experts say that in some cases they can dispute the interpretation of complex data and that the intelligence community and the ministry of defence support healthy dialogue in connection with these important national security considerations . &quot;
the research shows that iraq and syria will deal with the problem beyond whether the bombing operation of its predecessors in america continues ( this is an argument made by more defense officials every day ) .
but last year , have exposed president obama &apos;s question of how can trust the centre command for honest assessments of military operations at iraq , afghanistan , libya and other crisis points .
despite the criticism of islamic state intelligence , centcom intelligence analyst gregory hooker wrote an article in which he defended the administration of a small force in iraq , despite opposition from many analysts , in the george w. bush administration , and said he did not think enough of the 2003 invasion in which he started and debated for more than a decade .
mr hooker , at the same time , is playing a significant role in islamic state intelligence on the one hand .
the authorities have concluded that mr. hooker &apos;s team has built temporary refineries to sell oil on the black market in spite of public statements to the contrary last year , and has concluded that the terrorist group did not substantially affect the financial resources of the islamic state terrorist group .
the times in september , however , found that this finding did not come out of the central command .
centcom was then in the sand when general lloyd j. austin iii , last year , put many laws in his statement in the senate as a very positive assessment of the war , apparently for criticism .
general austin retired in april and was replaced by the central command of the person general joseph l. votel .
the united states is to match with a us women &apos;s hockey team wins the victory of her arrock 4 .
katie bam scored three goals in the 6-1 win against japan on thursday , a day after the americans beat india 3-0 in the first two goals of the united states women &apos;s grass hockey team .
the five goals in two matches seem to require a colorful catchy illness of bam ( 27 ) , who said he was not sure whether he would have done the same before .
he said to himself , &quot; i have no idea . &quot;
i &apos;m not the people who record the score .
he knows : americans are 4-0 ahead of the olympic tournament and beat japan on thursday after losing 2-0 in the first place in the group with an unbeaten path .
the united states and the united states will face for the final game of the first round on saturday .
in both teams are entitled to the quarterfinals , and the match will determine who will finish second in the group &apos;s matches , and who will finish second .
after the first of the group matches , the team will face a slightly longer period of time with the strong dutch team , the leader of another group that starts the quarter finals .
after saturday &apos;s game , however , americans made surprising progress here after the london olympics where they won the last of the 12 teams .
bam was in this team .
he himself grew up in blue bell , pa . ; when he first received the hockey stick when he was 3 at the age of ( the were interested in this sport ) and joined the national team at the age of 16 , he became the youngest player in the team .
he missed the 2008 olympics because he did not to the last staff .
later he and his teammates did not go towards most of the things for 2012 .
the next year , a british coaches craig parnham took the oath of office and things began to change .
, &quot; a cultural change , a mental change , a physical change , &quot; he says .
we don &apos;t work like in london anymore .
it &apos;s completely transformed .
on thursday night , bines hit a closely at odds with the first number of the first half .
india was not yet a win in the tournament but the team had a surprising level of endurance in the lead up to the third quarter , where bam managed to maintain a 1-0 lead .
he took a long time with the ball from the left of the field , and said he took the ball and put the americans 2-0 lead .
melissa gonzales scored the final goal towards the middle of the fourth quarter .
this was one of the first three victories in the united states goalkeeper , briggs , to score a goal in the tournament , not the first munk of .
opened the chance was opened .
bac , too .
&quot; we are in a good place at the moment , &quot; he said , but it depends on the conclusion of saturday &apos;s match , which is how well this site is .
olympic ambitions in the village of the
regardless of where you are , no matter how many hours , the olympics continue .
events in rio de janeiro represent a mixture of ambitions , competition and work , and it will never end , like it or not .
the olympic torch relay itself is like a flare-up to swimmers , gymnasts then triatloncommenter referred to as .
simone biles , katie ledecky , or michael phelps and his name le clos , cannot follow the television without a thing about strife , cannot read the newspaper or listen to what your neighbor says in a cafe .
and logan dooley , too .
for the first time , mr. dooley , who has been participating in the olympics for the first time , sponsors and makes you feel good about watching tv advertisements like a swimmer , gymnast or fencer , who can turn a blind eye to one of the names shown in the prime time .
but from lake of california , mr. dooley ( 28 ) is fighting for a gold medal at the olympics .
the olympic alhouse doesn &apos;t have not replicate every event .
also , in part , away from the centre , there are no universally recognizable sports : air rifle waste , archery , badminton , etc .
breastfeeding will always be with us , with the wish to be in a long time .
i would like to draw attention to the secret magic of the tramadol , if it is my personal as most loved one .
although it has been known as an olympic event since 2000 , when both tramadol was promoting sydney games , very few people were asked in the 16 years to realise that it was an olympic sport .
this may be a regional illiteracy .
the united states is sending athletes for the competition , but there has never been a medal in the tramadol and a rising contestant to the finals until 2012 .
men awards for the chinese and the russians , while women share the chinese and canadians .
china &apos;s dong dong and canada &apos;s rosie maclennan will try to preserve their gold medals in london this year .
it is worth noting , however , that the tramadol is an event as an event ; part of the reason for this is partly due to the fact that unconsciousness towers could be considered to be awarded to the palliative care school instead of the olympics .
i admit that i am not the expert here , i just have the issue of .
the funny thing is that there is a potential ( never the end ) of the jump created by the cartoon like the other , but basically the two sports , which is that brought together gymnastics and dwarfs .
the word &quot; trams &quot; comes from the spanish hand tramadol ; this is the meaning of the word &quot; tramps . &quot;
the champion candidates are presided over by a large tramadol almost in the air , taking 30 precautions and putting them at their feet before a series of moves ( scholarships , pike and salto ) to do .
according to the official olympic programme , the executive has difficulty and is evaluated according to &quot; flight limits . &quot;
thirty-two athletes , including 16 men from 17 countries in rio , will compete .
the olympics are the direct advanced in progress .
those who hoped to receive the medal , in some cases in search of gold , in some cases have been up to the point of the , in some cases farther back , with more or less movements , faster and more or less .
not only are they not pursuing the finish wall either , at the same time , there is another formidable line in the television publication ; the world or the olympic record .
the effort is noble , envy and even extreme levels ; it is enough to bring tears to even a viewers .
however , however , that the full games feature light exhausting .
drying , you can give a break to all of them .
the move to the right .
goals is not to move forward .
upper right picks up , like the astronaut , does not appear to be more or less interest , down , and more or less interest in the text .
of course , there is no competition or difficulty , but in order to reach the conclusion of the duration of the routine , there is no lost work , away from work , just like the imagination of the time and place of the suspension of the oval .
holding an olympic race is so much more than if he can be .
the women &apos;s rankings and then finals will be held at 13.00 on friday afternoon in the eastern savior ; men again on saturday at 13 .
nbc will publish the finals on both days starting at 14.00 in the afternoon .
in the middle of the olympic madness , they can ignore the general melee in a quiet and wonderful moment .
and awareness suggests that the of the united states of america will be able to the wall street journal only an eye on the eye , just as they proposed recently , and by offering male athletes to criticise the , mr. dooley expects new fans .
ally of ethiopia , the for a long time , &quot; a generation of protestants
protesters inside the violence in ethiopia
demonstrators demanding political change in ethiopia , faced with fierce resistance from the government &apos;s .
qades says several protesters say they have taken the deadly weapons coups in a shootout with police .
ethiopia to collapse ?
over the last decade , africa has been a solid ally for the west , with one of the most stable nations and fast growing economy .
in recent months , however , anti-government protests have rocked the country by spreading to more regions every day .
last week alone , thousands of people were called for a fundamental political change in the street .
according to human rights groups , the government &apos;s response was quite merciless .
masterpieces , police officers shot and killed several unarmed demonstrators .
the protest footage , thought to be from late last year or early this year , is seen by security officials who had broken their hands against a wall and forced young people to stand up .
the highest level united nations human rights official now at the top wants a thorough review .
&quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together , and it will be much more difficult to move forward , &quot; says obdi abdi , project director of the international crisis group , a research group .
after ethiopia , after nigeria , africa &apos;s population , is the highest nation in the and the is appreciated by the west .
the american military and intelligence services have been working closely with the nigerians to combat terrorist threats in the region , particularly in somalia , and there are very few countries that have been helped by the west in africa .
ethiopia &apos;s economy is growing in an impressive way .
the infrastructure has been effectively improved ; in the capital , addis ababa , even a new commuter train is present .
and the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean .
whatever the best example of democracy in ethiopia is not displayed ( although human rights groups have repeatedly referred to the repressive attitude of the government ) within the country , the opposition was quite limited , effectively silencing opponents .
many were sent into exile , imprisoned , killed or driven to the most distant corners of the earth .
however , this may be about to change .
seyoum tesht , a university professor from central ethiopia , said , &quot; if you have drowned people and offer them no other choice than to protest , these events are of interest . &quot;
youth completely in protest .
a generation of protest .
many complaints are under pressure from the ruling coalition over the use of land .
after last year &apos;s pretty criticism of the election , the ruling party and its allies also took the last post of filling out opponents , and now control 100 per cent of the parliament .
at the same time , tensions in the border with eritrea , which led to the war that killed hundreds of people in june , are also on the rise .
analysts fear that separatist groups , such as the oromo freedom front or ogaden national freedom front , have disappeared in recent years , citing the proliferation of this species .
the bitter feeling of being boiled under the surface for years is the reason why there are a few factors that are now exploding .
the first is innocent : smart phones .
cheap smart phones are spreading and internet service has started to communicate using a large number of ethiopian social media only a few years ago that .
the government has , especially in times of protest , often closed access to facebook and twitter , even when the most people were able to communicate through internet caretaker servers that hide their positions .
a few young ethiopian said they had gathered in this way for the protests .
in the second , the solidarity between the two major ethnic groups of ethiopia , oromos and amharalists .
oromos and amharalists are not normally allies .
for a very long , ethiopia has been the dominant christian in the mountainous regions of amhariah policy and businesses , most of which were muslim , and in plain land , the oromite was not abused .
however , that is changing .
&quot; we are moving toward co-operation to gather under one umbrella , &quot; said mulatu gemechu , an oromo leader of the .
the biggest protests were seen in the amhara and oromo regions .
apart from that , most amhara and oromo , ethiopia , account for about 6 percent of the population , and the military , intelligence services , trade and policy dominated the tigrera ethnic group , which is not fair by members of the ethnic group .
the third reason behind the unrest is the death of meles zenawi &apos;s .
mr meles , the former rebellion leader , served as prime minister of ethiopia for 17 years until he died from an undisclosed illness in 2012 .
seeing everyone was going to be able to find , who was considered a tactical genius .
nevertheless , he says , he is an expert on identifying the first signs of unrest and ineffective and its competitors .
&quot; the current regime does not have this basic knowledge , &quot; said mr. abdi , a conflict analyst .
ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , hailesmariam desalega , has been chosen in limbo to fill mr meles .
in contrast to mr. meles from the tigray region of northern ethiopia , mr. hailesmariam is south of the .
analysts say that he has failed to gain the confidence of the security services controlled by tigrayans , he says , .
as a result , more blood with more fear .
ethiopia &apos;s recent experience on such a turmoil was the protest following the theft of thousands of people in 2005 , after analysts said the government had a choice from the beginning .
the measures that followed , both less than last month , were killed and many protesters were killed in the period of turmoil was also relative moved to this period .
development experts praised ethiopia &apos;s leaders for remarkable progress in infrastructure planning and the fight against poverty , such as the new commuter train .
however , however , it is clear that it does not stop the increased tide against the government of ethiopia .
and this is dangerous and ethnic .
last month , protesters in the town of gondar , an amhara town , attacked businesses owned by tigrayans , and the in in social media .
analysts say the protests are leaving a strange situation in the united states and other allies in the west , .
the united states government has used ethiopia as a base for drone flights on neighbouring somalia ; however , it was recently been told that the base was closed .
it is clear that the west wants to promote democracy in a fragile region of the does not want fragmentation .
mr abdi said : &quot; this is a very fine , &quot; he said and added , &quot; i like to walk on . &quot;
donald trump announces &quot; allegations &quot; of the obama &apos;s , in which he founded isis
donald j. trump , on friday , insisted a few times last week that obama and hillary clinton were not serious while claiming that the islamic state terrorist group &quot; founders &quot; tried to eliminate the recent conflict around the campaign .
this statement gave birth to new questions about the republican presidential candidate &apos;s ability to communicate openly with the american people .
at the same time , it is best to defend it in the process that created chaos , as well as to that this is not what the deputies are trying to explain in a strange position in the process , .
mr trump proposed this at a rally wednesday night after further strengthening his thesis on thursday in interviews with the president and mrs clinton , who insisted that the drivers were really implied that .
but in his sending via twitter in the early hours of the morning on friday , mr. trump said he had only cynical testimony .
sending in a series of interviews , mr. trump said he was serious about this charge a day before he was completely back on the show that .
conservative radio programmer hugh hewitt said he wanted to destroy the drivers of mr. obama , a reminder that mr. trump tried to help him soften this comment when he said he did not believe it was the republican vice presidential candidate , .
mr trump has come to the final confusion when trying to change the focus of his campaign after a drop in the polls .
mr trump and mrs clinton clashed with each other on the economy in michigan this week .
on friday , mr trump has asked him to return to this issue again .
once again , via twitter , mrs clinton &apos;s offer would increase taxes and he found himself boring in his speech .
mr. trump had previously used his advocacy defense .
at the end of july , after the russians faced great criticism after taking a look at mrs clinton &apos;s e-mails offering a hacker attack , she said , &quot; of course i am cynical about it .
this approach allows mr. trump to push the limits of political speech and take a step back in the required location .
ruth sherman , a communications expert who follows the language used by both candidates , said in a statement that &quot; this is an order that provides a way to explain how specific messages are treated by supporters itself , depending on the reaction to the . &quot;
at the same time , however , knowing their declarations and that it is unclear as much as possible from different makers will filter out .
after a fall in the polls recently , mr. trump has taken a much more aggressive stance than to soften the air for the general election audience .
a new nbc / wall street journal / marist survey released on friday showed that mr. trump was quite behind mrs clinton in northern coraline , virginia and colorado , and a tight race exists in florida .
whatever mr. trump usually does , he has to apologize for the inflammatory things he has done , but he does not understand the words or humor of those who criticise him .
but mr. trump &apos;s joke , which has exposed much more scrutiny in the final months of the presidential campaign , leaves the remaining loyal supporters struggling to support it in public if his comments are provocative .
former new york city mayor rudolph w. giuliani is doing his best to defend the candidate in an interview with cnn on thursday as one of mr. trump &apos;s most suggested supporters .
when asked about the accuracy of mr. trump &apos;s thesis that mr. obama and mrs clinton set up an islamic state , mr. giuliani said , &quot; i think it &apos;s legitimate , political criticism . &quot;
also , a point of view , before obama was an unknown , small company , those who find love for them were completely mistakes , and this was due to the withdrawal of troops from iraq .
aside from the fact that most republican , mrs clinton &apos;s foreign ministry has failed to cope with the situation in the middle east , the obama administration has failed to aggressively deal with the situation in the middle east and is trying to defend what was caused by the growth of the fund .
ahead of the rallies in pennsylvania on friday , trump is blaming each word on the news media via twitter and continues to accuse him of being biased against it .
trying to solve him , he made a mockery of the television specialists , who &quot; cannot do this ! &quot;
with some democrats ridiculed by mr. trump , he said it was evidence that he was not eligible for the presidency .

esmer-brass knocks .
the cafe is no longer the beer service but offers fresh fruit juices .
nine months later , mr. rodriguez said he noticed that the old patrons had begun to arrive decisively .
&quot; many former clients are not at the top of prices in vicksburg , &quot; he said .
last sunday , rebecca oliveira was one of those clients .
mrs oliveira ( 34 ) lives in williamsburg , va . , and is often in the spotlight .
even after moving to greenpeace , he did not give up on this path .

mr. rodriguez wants to make changes and add new materials to the menu .
nowadays , mr. rosenthal still receives the usual orders , but sometimes every day the figures of bacon , eggs and cheese make some change .
mr rodriguez said there was no in the soap store , which was replaced by the former site .
conversely , the owners of soap cherie offered to make a special soap for the , which was using the cold breakfast dementia .

president roosevelt , who was the one to fall into the desert , crushed his lungs , crushed his lungs , and was decorated , like the turtles of soup , the food .
the menu on that day was much more modest : tomato sauce boiled eggs , potatoes , and dessert , alluding to the dry era .
jane ziegelman said , &quot; this was an act of solidarity with the people who were grieving .
his wife , andrew coe , added : &quot; this was a message to the americans about how they should eat at the same time . &quot;
the couple , who live in brooklyn heights , that is the culinary historian .
in his latest book , &quot; chop suey , &quot; mr. coe &apos;s latest book , &quot; chop suey , &quot; was right on china cuisine in america , and mrs ziegelman wrote in his book &quot; 97 orchard &quot; about his lifetime of the in the limelight .
the new book , which they worked with , and which will be published by harper on tuesday , tells the history of america during the great depression era .
with solidarity on the food themselves , the crisis began in the year 1929 , which marks the start of the crisis , which is located in the flatiron area of the village of jesse sandwell , where he met with a reporter for dinner .
mrs ziegelman ( 54 ) ordered the king &apos;s cheese and olive sandwich , while mr. coe ( 57 ) preferred to put on meat , turkey , potatoes , and vegetables .
the pair found it to discuss the reporter &apos;s bearish orders during the period of the ruly comedy order .
mrs ziegelman said he was &quot; enormously popular , &quot; said .
to place the salmon , the salmon , the dry bean salmon .
then they spread the material with a material that was something cheap .
i consider that you have enough room for dinner .
mr coe left the face , mr. coe .
&quot; people like lead should be sitting at the foot of the in the , &quot; he said .
in the years before the crisis , especially in rural areas , the table was like buffet .
women cooked meals for men working on the farm , and had breakfast , lunch and dinner was served in the fresh cooking tours of the restaurant .
the europeans , who died of hunger in world war i. , were sending food to europeans , explains the history of methods to cope with the nation &apos;s from a now cyclical center .
mr coe explained why he and his wife had a desire to write about this issue , saying , &quot; this is a time when food has become a central for the americans , worrying aspect for . &quot;
the new budget regime was equally concerned : the mysterious food , such as the sommers and stewardship , became the basic consumer product , mrs ziegelman said , adding that &quot; stewardship is a great method for evaluating the remaining dishes . &quot;
the fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit , which was .
over the years the meat , which has been at the center of american dishes , has become a luxury that has been share .
lots of interesting mixing for the value of calories and the taste of the test , and the sense of taste or general kitchen .
mrs ziegelman has been doing research for his book , which also includes recipes , while in the era of peanuts , he has prepared the onions trademark .
mr. coe said , &quot; this wasn &apos;t a favorite contribution at the dinner table , &quot; he said .

&quot; i like to eat european cuisine , like a salad sauce such as well as salaty chocolate- , &quot; mr. coe said .
then , wearing the appropriate jackets at the dinner table , almost completely covered in gold , was a meal in the room .
it was very far from reality .
his wife , eleanor , would not be able to encourage it to be an example with her , even though president roosevelt could fall into the same mistake .
as far as the book is concerned , mrs roosevelt was hired by a deputy who never championed the tastes of the white house in taking the job , but at the same time , began to be presented with &quot; the most somber food prepared . &quot;
when the country was back on its feet , most of the methods to eat during the crisis were set aside .

everybody was hesitant to find a way to brown the blood of the .
not surprisingly , it wasn &apos;t too bad .
mr. coe took the second and third spoilers .
saving his wife , like the one who could have been &quot; a bit or a bit of nuts , &quot; he said would have been good to be .

hussein goodby : gulen &apos;s demolition depends on the collapse of the 3 bears
who interpret the coup attempt by telling the .
hussein would sell the statements by saying :
through my mind they attempted a coup , as they attempted to write this issue in the last 5-6 months , but they cannot do within the chain of command , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
i didn &apos;t do not know the two things ; the first is to be this broadly common and deep , for example the gendarmerie general commander of 8 years and the competence of mr. president .
mr. president , the people who fight the most , how to pay attention to whom they chose , but the most important of them is an unprecedented invasion of privacy .
they are two centuries .
&quot; this is not the business that fetbc can do , &quot; he said , adding that one of the most important evidence is to such a deep in the sand .
support from the cia .
the cia , this masterpiece was taken very early .
in 2014 , said that , it will be replaced by the 1971 vehicle fuat east fetullah gulen .
the people who are interested , with most interested in this era of relations between the lands and the cia , are the closest to the period .
us pay the wages of the personnel of the armed forces , do not remember them after one man broke it as follows :
we &apos;ve learned that when we learn it , we are in 2014 .
mahmut bey &apos;s writing , after all , was not have a statement denying it .
for example , orphans , to be fair , he was not caught in a row ?
who is curious about this thought to be .
the man had gone to pensylvania 2 times in the last 25 days before the coup , he returned 2 days ago .
fair orphans have gone 109 times since 2002 abroad .

will be seen , that they do not have to take an opportunity to go on to .
but the real liaison with the cia is that it can be detected from a couple of people ; especially the police , who are supposed to be raising the police from the very people who were sent to the united states in .
wikileaks documents exist ; it is set up , and this association is common meetings with the cia .
15 years ago that links to the cia were made to show the image .
i say this is an intelligence pool in transylvania 2 years ago .
the man who works at the prime minister was working at the .
but the bad thing is ; this information fell to the cia as it fell in .
gulen &apos;s demolition was tied to the collapse of the three bears ; one base , which we base , was the friendly link that was , well , deep in the , there are those who say that even the coup attempt , is still in his film .
three feet , or a base of support .
questions of theft , theft , and right to vote , much of this base support .
the other two feet ; political support , international support .
international support is still available .
the only thing that will break political support was baykal and mhp managers documented that the tape was pulled out of the by fetbc .
shortly after the july 15 , the &quot; feture &quot; of mr. kilicdaroglu , who has opened his eyes .
gulen has a number that says , &quot; i don &apos;t do that around me . &quot;
in my echo , he says , &quot; yahweh hussein mosque , this girl blows very different dreams , they send me , they send me , because i am no longer banned , because the dream is not true . &quot;

in the red , while the heat of the white light will
each year , the lake drops off during the rain , some of which will fall to the surface of the body , he said .
persecution of up to 2,000 degrees .
temperatures in the atmosphere are warming and because the perseids are in a natural environment while temperatures are red , heat , while they produce light in white .
it can be found that the international rainbow archive has been viewed as many celestial bodies of the internet site .
this data is the value of information collected from all over the world has gathered each other .
stream all night
the milestone of rain moving at about 60 miles per second is a reminder that this visual feast in the sky is a good way to shed light on the northeast , which can be watched throughout the night , in a good way .

less educated , former football player , he
even though the balance was overturned , less educated former footballer recep tayyip erdogan , a populist isil , led by a widely devout entrepreneur , fetullah gulen from tashkent , has been the winning alliance of highly educated followers of dozens of universities and educational institutes .
above , policy in an article in the last week of the sentence .
he is a little educated and former football player ; he is an elementary school graduate and former football player ; he is widely praised by gulen followers as a broad horizon entrepreneur , and similar articles are often cited in western media .
and then , on the other hand , in his article &quot; why america and / or western semitism rises ? , &quot; they are trying to explain the sentence began in turkey .
the western opponents in turkey are unaware of turkey &apos;s history , which analysts see as a situation during erdogan &apos;s era .
in fact , according to statistics , during the first decade of his term , his western opponents decreased or had , on average , be read as a result of the term .
since this was in ten years with the united states in the synchronised manner , it was good relations .
the fact that has been criticism of israel for its , the eu &apos;s failure to put a clear policy on turkey of the assad regime as the result of the civil war in syria , and the impact of all the intelligence and logistical support in the refugee crisis , as well as the support of all of the figures in the refugee crisis , as well as in the refugee crisis , the opposition groups , such as the president of the european parliament , recep tayyip erdogan said : &apos; it &apos;s not as we &apos;re not going to be a threat to erdogan , the opposition groups , the president of the european parliament , are going to be able to find out if they &apos;re not going to be a threat to the pkk &apos;s syrian arm of the islamic state , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to , on the other hand , and the united states , .
as a result of the bloody coup , we lost 247 people , our alleged ally , the eu countries and the united states and the united states from the failure of the coup until proven the failure of our democracy , they expect to build peace and stability in turkey , with no emphasis on democracy and the elected government , let &apos;s say .
and while 11 charlie hebdo employees in paris were killed in the protest march , many leaders from around the world participated in the protest march , but did when it came to fighting tanks for democracy , 247 people were killed in a month after the coup attempt in the past , which did not any speaker from any western country , will be forgotten ?
the issue of refugees a few times a year for the president or senior representative of those who sent it to the lower levels , what will we say ?
if the daily hurriyet that has broken the windows , all the eu and us ambassadors will go to visit the past , and how to evaluate the bombing during a solidarity visit to parliament ?
in the first two weeks when the coup in egypt took place in the first two weeks leading up to the coup leader sisi shake hands with the coup , expressed concern about turkey &apos;s , it should be that democracy is being rebuilt in support of the coup , who at every opportunity to express in the western countries , are concerned about its democracy , rather than the lack of sincere in turkey ?
even allowing 95 % of people to be freely in the united states , where 95 % of the public view gulen as responsible for the coup , are now enough to infuriate the turkish people .
if the above plan is included in the plan , i think it is clear that the rising west / america opponents will not be able to be released with just that .
and he is currently in recession , he is not even considering the us effect ...
means that the polling stations were never unaware of the of the
with the growing intelligence of his own people , who are small , who do not think like him , he is &quot; ignorant &quot; of the growing intelligence they can steal from the same telcos after the night of july 15 , ?
this is how people after the state and democracy is , and then they seek to answer the question &quot; where are we wrong &quot; ?
but the questions that need to be answered are so much more than that ?
the officers , who served in various positions until the treacherous , and the officers granted them the right to use their weapons in the state , to enter into the status of &quot; hain &quot; a moment , and did not want asylum from foreign states .
also , we live in a mental hit environment and we gaze at people looking at how to be to the behaviour of the people as we see it .
sulphur declarations when it comes to the coup d &apos;Ã©tat ...
for the participants of this action in cities like the cities of syria , there was a point of view ?
an officer bombs the parliament of his own country ?
packed with the bedside of the mattress , we should not fall into an illusion that it was like to wait for appropriate behavior .
other responsible to let them know that everything is responsible for everything that is not just the .
the , and offers as a profession of hatred , there are also cadres who make the necessary contributions to the tragedies that occur .
the , offering themselves as &quot; created , &quot; are all types of rule out behaviour , and even the term biographical is natural to the masses .
people hate their own people when they are given weapons on how to shoot this public even at the end .
way of democracy , the way we know the way
i say something very simple : on the evening of the 15th july in turkey , the popular soldier , fet7000 , assists in racket , racket , 250 killed in the series , and to save democracy .
but behind the 15th of july , 1992 ; 2002 and 2012 ; there are three terms , including 2012 and the aftermath .
there are three changes to the set in this three period : economic , social , political .
social change has drawn two major phenomenon : the rural areas of the , and the migration of these migrations to the centre after a very long period of time around the cities .
i moved this on wednesday through the metro .
the subway is not the most important social change in the element if they do not pass , he emphasised .
the same finger is the second major change in bridges and roads .
contribution to the modernisation of the road and bridge is more easily understandable .
road income , economic and social structure change .
we have the one that has changed the political structure .
this date was at the height of the bridge i spotted with me .
built , at the bridge .
this 1950s peasant movement in the 1960s .
ozal continued with the second bridge , which we now name as the 15 july martyrs bridge .
even routes to them - the relationship established between the centre and the centre .
he is also a sign of how a social change course is monitored .
demirel and ozal were in the centre of the great masses of soda at the centre of .
to them the ideology of the centre .
the eu did not have the third bridge over the years .
because of the whole rate of .
people who were relocated to satellite cities .
a a slightly closed system in that areas .
the party of local governments gave people , jobs , social status , they voted for the party .
the masses are thus not at the centre of osteoporosis in the environment , and the centre they were then asked to come to themselves as well .
this formation has to do with the ongoing wear discussions ahead of the party ( 1992-2002 ) .
these discussions are conservative , builders and stoning people not to integrate with the centre , but the obligation to stand side by side with the masses .
the party acted with the method i mentioned in 2002 , when the masses were politicised , in politics , of maturity .
take note , then , that the construction of the 3rd bridge is the chair of the democratic fight on 15 july .
that means that history and sociology coincide .
it might add another dimension to this : the party &apos;s move mentioned , is not limited to just istanbul bridges .
one more interesting thing : the party is now integrating environmental cities with the central cities .
this is supplied through two bridges .
one , the veterans bridge .
two , the bridge of 1915 .
add ways to the .
turkey , from thrace to izmir , will now reach another route .
if you know what this was , izmir will now be a different city .
let &apos;s get inside the party , let &apos;s say , izmir can take from the outside .
now bursa , now the cities of thracian , will turn into another five and social geography .
so sexy !
the july 15th martyrs are the stars of this great adventurous martyrs .

robert amsterdam is very telling about the fetbc !
robert amsterdam , an official of the amsterdam &amp; partners law firm , which is legally investigating the activities of the fetullahan terror ( fetbc ) , has written an article in the us magazine forbes about how to organise fetbc .
&quot; it is quite clear that the organisation of about 150 contracted ( charter ) schools in the united states will be treated well under the of the organisation , which is closely related to in the united states , &quot; said amsterdam gulen &apos;s , chief executive of fetbc .
amsterdam , seven months ago by turkey , said it had been deployed its applicability of the to affiliated companies and schools , stressing that the find so far is &quot; shocking . &quot;
amsterdam , commented on the article :
the attendant tells us that the gulen organization has a strict hierarchy of instructions .
these instructions generally refer to the meetings on the face-to-face of gulen poconos .
he has a management group of seven people in the ( consultation group ) .
this group has spoken to the advisory committee .
the instructions then go to the regional imam , the country imaging to regional implants , the area implants within the country &apos;s imam , the district &apos;s imam , the district &apos;s imam , the district &apos;s imam , and students &apos; houses ( light homes ) and students .
businessmen , bureaucrats and officers are working at different levels according to their positions and support within the organization .
the organisation has opened 55,000 jobs around the world , with the largest contracted school network in the united states , covering amsterdam , the american taxpayers paid hundreds of millions of dollars each year from taxes to these schools .
in amsterdam , much of this money is being directed by members of the organisation themselves and transferred to the &quot; elected &quot; subcontractors companies .
amsterdam , explained the functioning of this functioning is :
magnolia schools , based in california , are linked to the gulen schools and shared the same office the equivalent of the annual service to the company while the $ 700,000 was captured .
amsterdam , as another example , showed the dove science academy in oklahoma .
amsterdam has also paid an extra $ 3.1 million to the property owner in this school , as well as controls the school and property owner of the company , the same people linked to the with gulen , he said .
noting that there are similar situations in 46 franchises which hold the largest place in the in the nation , amsterdam said it was that smaller companies linked to fetbc have paid money with items such as software license , curriculum purchase of the .
&quot; this gave me examples of the abuse of nearly $ 28 million of american taxpayers , &quot; amsterdam said , underscoring the fact that each other was rich .
&quot; and this is precisely what we have found so far the part of our , &quot; he said .
as far as something has been done to prevent such incidents , amsterdam noted that the situation in the language of last time was going to get worse , after all they had been reminded that the department of education had begun to investigate irregularities .
amsterdam , the apparent normal functioning of schools , stressed that many employees had no information of what kind of corruption .
&quot; however , in fact , these schools are working like a snow machine for gulen . &quot;
&quot; gulen then uses the massive amount of money for political donations to conceal his lawless activities , &quot; he said .
according to the testimony of a former american teacher who worked in these schools , he said some employees in the gulen schools had meetings separately , describing the transfer of a certain section of their salaries to the organisation . &quot; the members of the turkish armed forces are believed to have worked in similar functioning . &quot;
the coup instigators strengthened their positions over the years .
&quot; however , on the surface , the army was collecting power behind a parallel force while doing business in the normal way , &quot; he wrote .
amsterdam , the article reads as follows :
the policymakers in the united states have questions of interest in events between july 15 and 16 , and this is something that is to be expected .
the two allies , however , have dealt with their diplomatic level , while the individual state authorities need to wake up to the swift violation of us laws in gulen &apos;s operations of the .

dr. bilgin giray , a professor of dentistry at the faculty of medicine , said that children have been relieved with these sanitation by making it a need to emulate the children from their first age .
&quot; it is an event that occurs in children from birth to 4 years of the , starting from birth . &quot;

underlined , while scot callum skinner flew home
the great britain team trio retained their title from london 2012 , while kerr was on the race track to victory last night in the men &apos;s race in the .
glasgowlu , 23-year-old , took the lead role , namely , a chris hoy , and this young , appreciated new zealand clothes returned to his home with the triumph of this legend when he .
hoy &apos;s six olympic gold medals in the event , including five of four years ago , was a shock victory for great britain .
and despite the fact that hoy had retired after finishing sixth in the world championship in london in march , but reiterated it .
the problem between beijing and london was that the expert &apos;s initial player , jamie , was changed .
exactly hindes made it out at the moment .
hoy &apos;s retirement was also a vacuum that he is trying to fill kian emadi and matt crampton .
the scot had previously seen the potential of aggressiveness , and british coaches have not abandoned skinner .
the champion , along with hoy four years ago , is the champion , kenny and skinner ranking in the olympic record in the first round , though new zealand set this record in the first round again .
and the in the british trio , duel for gold .
were a bit behind in their own round , but kenny brought the team forward , and skinner was on it .
hindes are using a larger tool that will slow him down and keep up with kenny in particular , which is a big part of the transformation that this strategy was .
hoy watched them as an expert commentator from the bbc , and when they were on the podium , he ran afoul of skinner , kenny and hindes .
skinner , 23 , said : &quot; this is an honour comparison . &quot;
i just want to give my best and i &apos;m here to announce the step .
then we beat the olympic record and beat the world championships .
this is really unbelievable .
there cannot be a better way to do this .
hindes has admitted that he deliberately dropped the track after winning a victory with kenny and hoy in london 2012 .
i later responded to this subject and did not have a method of making a request to the competitors .
this time around , there was no such problem for an incredible victory .
hindes said : &quot; we are like in london , along with all the flags in the of the great british . &quot;
founded just three months ago , we have a backup .
i lost a lot of world race for this reason , having won the olympics again is really incredible feeling .
this is just one event for a nation that has won seven of the 10 races in both beijing and london , a medal .
this is the measure of progress we have shown in the last five months , five more days ahead of us successfully on the on the race track .
kenny &apos;s stance , namely , shows that hoy &apos;s dream of winning three gold medals in a single olympics is not too impossible for .
this is exactly what hoy is younger than 12 years of age , and he is also the of a-year-old ( who was born march 23 at the same time as steve redgrave , mo farah and roger bannister , a sports past sacred history ) , desire for six gold medals and a silver medal .
that means the same level with hoy .
kenny , after that , will be the sprint race ; the race will begin today and last for three days .
bolton , 28-year-old bolshoi tonight , said : &quot; for the time being , i just enjoy it .
team events are all the best events .
you can win together with your friends .
to be honest , when you win alone , people feel alone .
hindes said : &quot; if he wins two more gold medals should be given the title of . &quot;
this is only the event of this sunday medal but there are many good news for great britain .
a bradley wiggins , ed clancy , steven burke and owain doull have finished first in the rankings for the four-year team race .
track finished at 3 : 51,943 .
the winner of the gold medal in london 2012 set the world record for the at 3 : 51.59 .
the first round and final ( 22 : 42 ) will be determined in the second part today , and wiggins will draw all the attention .
before the round of rounds yesterday , officials called him to gauge the paint was a dispute with the officials , who had .
the women &apos;s event , which runs tomorrow and will be completed , will be attended by the respective women at the event , laura trott , joanna band , elinor barker and milngavie from katie architecture 4 : 13,260 for the world record .
the great britain team is counting on the strong bike team to take over the reins during the middle of the olympic games and win many medals .
after the big dominance in beijing and london , expectations in rio have been reduced .
in the background , there have been many bad developments involving the resignation of coach shane sutton &apos;s in april due to accusations of gender bias and tyranny , including the resignation of key figures such as hoy and victoria pendleton .
the track races on the track , however , show that the first night of the great recession is the first night of to finish the epic credibility that can be proven again this time around .
with the cancellation of the contract , the future of the portland izabe network suspected
the future of the portland aluminium trace network in victoria and the work of hundreds of workers fell into uncertainty following the expiration of a supply contract for one of the facility owners , which would lead to the cancellation of all supply contracts for the energy company that provides energy to the facility .
the move comes after a decision by the victoria government earlier this year to grant subsidies to continue working at the facility .
the 20 years of fixed subsidies expires in november .
alcoa &apos;s portland facilities could be at risk of business up to 2000 .
as far as any closure , up to 2000 jobs may be directly either directly or indirectly at risk .
and there may also be additional chain effects that consume about 10 per cent of the entire electricity consumed by the network victoria &apos;s .
in 2014 , alcoa point henry closed the stove , and this led to the closure of the anglefield power plant last year .
alcoa &apos;s portland izabe facility is losing money and is facing a risk of closure .
these developments have proved to be the result of a few years of speculation about the future of the facility , initially based on the strength of the australian dollar and the introduction of the facility &apos;s consumption fee .
loy yang , a loy yang of the loy yang a power plant located in the valley of latakia , said he expects the other three owners to take action to terminate the contracts .
a large majority of the facility is owned by alcoa and alumina , and china &apos;s citic , japan &apos;s , but also marubeni corp companies smaller shares of .
&quot; the agl expects to continue to work at the portland facility ; this means that there will continue to be a demand for physical electricity , &quot; he said .
agl has said it is &quot; balancing risk balancing contracts &quot; that are supposed to take effect from november 2016 .
the contracts will be completed in 2017 , when they are for a period of 12 months .
&quot; for this reason , agl will continue to wait for the contracts to contribute to the fiscal year 2017 , &quot; the energy company said .
the effects of agl &apos;s exposure on the 2018 fiscal year and its aftermath may be limited to the current situation , with a strong term contract stance for wholesale electricity prices .
agl said the value of contracts in the accounts due to &quot; bastards &quot; had already fallen by $ 187 million .
the decision to terminate the contracts &quot; does not affect the ability of alcoa to provide electricity supplies to the business or to the network , &quot; alcoa said .
the u.s. government signed a 20-year contract in 2010 ; this contract was supposed to come into force in november this year but has yet to pull out of this contract .
the analysts remain vigilant about the possibility of closure due to the economic woes in the sector , both in victoria &apos;s portland and newcastle area and near newcastle .
in response to the analysis earlier this week , agl &apos;s operations chief , stephen mikkels , said portland had used about 600 megawatts of energy each year , the equivalent of 900 megawatts of energy .
if both of these facilities are withdrawn from the market , the demand for the &#91; electricity &#93; market will be significantly lower .
and as a producer , this is not a good development for us , &quot; he said .
not only is he the star of the tv programme ; himself , vogue cover the number of september
she is the fourth daughter of the model and executive mother kris kardashian jenner ( 20 ) , who is the fourth daughter of the group that looks forward to the us vogue cover of september number .
a estee lauder brand ambassador , and milan , who were somewhat showing up in the fashion weeks of paris and new york , announced this on twitter account on thursday .
&quot; i was looking at this door in a room full of people , &quot; he wrote .
after the gates were announced , it was strange ( or just keeping keeper up with the kardashians , everyone &apos;s favourite show ) that rob and caitlyn , who had troubles at the bar , and released a reality video of the scenario ; the video girl &apos;s brothers forgot to cover the door ; in fact , they were preparing a surprise party .
although this is almost all children &apos;s television programmes with the stereotypes of every &quot; birthday &quot; section ( seacrest at 8 in the morning , with the sincerity of the in a cartoon ) , kris says , was not included in this promotion by other girls in a way that .
but with this development in the number of september , we are entering a new era of kim kardashian .
himself , the sister of kim , may have been past it on the cover of vogue ( the cover was shared with his wife kanye west in april 2014 ) , but the magazine was a success in itself on the cover of the september .
vogue in september , the number selling for most of the year .
with the thickness of coffee desk books from a fashion magazine , this number attracted the attention of many advertisers ( fashionista , last year &apos;s 832 pages of editing , found that there was advertising content in 615 ) .
the cover stars are also a closely monitored process ; the last two years have been leaked ahead of the official announcement of the magazine &apos;s .
among the women who had previously been included in the cover , is linda , and said to her .
in recent years , there has been a lot of celebrities who have been a lot of &quot; models &quot; in the cover . &quot;
oscar-winning dior envoy jennifer lawrence took part in the cover in 2013 , the next year , in honour of this honour , lady gaga .
but even if the magazine is described as the &quot; paranormal model &quot; of the generation by mrs jenn , even in the case of the previous category , it is pretty good .
these celebrities are not the young people of today who know how to draw the famous persons relative or reality show stars or the good snapline video of today &apos;s young people ( in , not all of them ) .
all of them are legitimate talent , the women who put forward in the entertainment industry , the .
beyonce , who appeared on took part in the cover of last year , one of the best times of her career with the exit of lemonade of the .
of course , not everyone is happy with jenson &apos;s success .
but due to the history of the show , jenson &apos;s position in the fashion world will always be disturbing .
in june , the original victoria &apos;s bore model , saga seymour criticised jenn , and his colleague gigi hadid for calling them &quot; at the time of the time of the . &quot;
jenny reports that the cover of vogue will appear on the surface again this thought to .
but the focus on satisfaction seems to be unfounded .
themselves , is on the cover of the vogue september numbers .
he &apos;s a super model-blown supermodel .
marc jacobson himself to the show .
from estee lauder fund you are ignoring .
he himself , along with his sisters , he sells pictures of his own on the walls of practice .
nude photos of cindy crawford sell nude photos of her daughter to the magazine .

social legal support centres of 300,000 people each year to reverse the
as the industry prepares for the impact of more funding cuts in operations , the already forced operations of over 165,000 people from the most protected areas of the nation have turned to social legal support centres .
the three of the five people in disneyland ( mostly the elderly , migrants , unprotected workers , victims of violence , and those who will struggle with unfair eviction decisions are those who are not the source and are seeking representation ) free legal advice and representation .
opportunities for social legal support services , which have been exhausted , are set to be interrupted more .
starting in june of next year , these legal support centres are scheduled to be deprived of more than 30 per cent of the federal funding .
james farrel , director of the centre for social legal support , reported that thousands of people have been turned away every year in the latest numbers of the national union of social legal support centres report .
mr farrel testified that if the federal government decision was not taken back , the situation would be much worse .
he himself said , &quot; disneyland &apos;s social legal support centres have a chronic amount of financial support , which means that thousands of people are unable to access vital services that are needed . &quot;
with the violent ties involved , the management of power and the people who struggle with the forces on the left , families in the process of secession , and workers who have been laid off in unfair ways ... all of them encounter problems with the legal dimensions and cannot reach their needed help , according to this report .
the federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent starting in june 2017 , which means that without protection , thousands of rhode island residents are forced to come out on top without help with more complex legal issues .
when people face a legal challenge to receive the support they need , the minister of justice and the governor of disneyland , george brandis , immediately take this financing cut back to the box .
last year , the government pledged to maximise the financing of legal support .
with the social legal support centres and the communities that serve them now , the palaszczuk government should look to investment in this important work .

supervision of the asset fund recommission discussed in the
the turkish presence fund , which is expected to be among the world &apos;s largest funds , silently lifted the affirmation of the law on .
the fund was given a reconsideration because of the lack of oversight mechanisms but was discussed in the commission again without any changes .
&quot; the assets belonging to the booths will certainly be excluded from the constitutional control mechanisms of this structure , which will consist of unemployment funds collected for the unemployed workers , pensioners , workers &apos; pension cuts , workers &apos; pension cuts for the unemployed , &quot; said chp member of parliament and budget commissioner utley jacket , discussing the akp &apos;s offer of law .
in an effort to the government &apos;s long-term funding for investments and projects , the turkish presence fund proposed legislation tuesday with the view that the opposition should also be discussed .
the akp , however , the proposal today , in the back to the plan and budget commission .
the parliamentary plan and budget commission &apos;s chp member essenehir djordjevic , a member of the chp , described the chp &apos;s concern and concern to the chp regarding the offer of the law .
&quot; the establishment of this fund comes within the draft of the plan and the budget commission , former finance minister zekerija temizal , who is at the helm of the chp delegation , expressed our concern and concern and concern and concern , this would be offered to discuss it in detail . &quot;
the , with the government adopted the bill .
the bill came to the commission again yesterday in the same form .
&quot; the government will insist on it to be issued from parliament within a week , &quot; he said .
&quot; we are on the biggest concern in this law is on the of the , &quot; he said , adding that .
&quot; the government &apos;s assets , which are owned by the public , will consist of pension cuts for the unemployed , the unemployment funds collected for the unemployed , the proceeds of the privatisation of the privatisation revenues from privatisation , the privatisation of parliament and a structure which does not have any responsibility whatsoever , &quot; he said .
&quot; however , when such funds were established , russia , china and the gulf states have their oil revenues and trade , and the fund has been financed in this way , &quot; he said .
the fund will consist of money from public sources , namely , the public .
with a total of 100 billion euros in the unemployment fund , 100 billion will be transferred from individual pension funds to employees , 50 billion privatisation .
&quot; this means that the fund , which will consist entirely of public money , should be in public control and that money should not be spent responsibly , , &quot; he said .
when the resources of the state are collected , the borrowing of assets belonging to the state in a fund where collateral is excluded from the control of the parliament is unacceptable , he stressed that the variety fund code offers concern and concerns about the offer described :
with such a large collection of public assets , spending on public behalf , business and transactions , only independent audit companies cannot pass the audit .
necessarily be in public control and need a transparent structure .
under the offer of the law , there are no provisions on the supervision and transparency of the constitutional institutions .
there is no limit on how much funds will be transferred .
no one will ever be able to account for how this fund is used .
cited the financing of major projects as the purpose of the fund .
you don &apos;t need to establish a fund that controls outside the budget for this .
why do you get into the budget ?
when it comes down to it , the question is , &quot; why do you run out of gas and run out of ? &apos; . &quot;
the accumulation of money in the fund is not against the transfer of investments , but it is not transparent , it is being done with mechanisms that do not account , jackie said . &quot; there is a need for such a fund to be discussed . &quot;
but if the government insists that , then , such investment funds were established in other countries , we have to ensure that applicable international standards are in place .
necessarily be structured in a way that the mechanism of control and responsibility .
there will be no seathing on the part of citizens to account for their own money , which should be set up in a way that will account for it .
&quot; we are pleased that the akp will listen to our criticism in parliament , especially after the 15 july coup attempt , &quot; said jackie chan , who is staunchly opposed to the commission &apos;s offer .
this law is in the hope that we will listen to our constructive criticism of .
use of national assets as rules , transferred , irresponsible to those who are , and we are against the fact that they are although public control .
&quot; however , it can only be beneficial if these concerns are settled , &quot; he said .
on the offer of law to ensure that it is between the akp and the opposition work for the .

i think this is the incredible effort of all the nation and regions to benefit from the games as it is in london 2012 , which will make heathrow a pretty attractive destination .
great advantages for the olympics , stratford and the east end .
and heathrow is close to heathrow to creating opportunities for local people and companies to do it again .
with only 10,000 new internships available for our local communities , 40,000 new jobs will be created and we will not leave unemployed young people around the airport .
as london is ahead of 2012 , the struggle to expand heathrow would have been will also be more challenging .
he told me that britain can never be prepared for the games and that we will be all over the world , the said .
those doubts were wrong in 2012 , and will be seen in the wrong on heathrow .
there would always be obstacles to overcome but heathrow answered all the questions that were asked .

expanding the expansion , 150,000 new jobs and an opportunity to create 211 billion pounds of economic growth and many skills and jobs across both around the airport and throughout the united kingdom .
heathrow has been named the best airport terminal in the world for five years ( in the rear of t2 ) , up to t2 , with a wonderful team that has introduced an infrastructure investment of 11 billion pounds on time and budget for the world &apos;s two most congested roads in the world .
now we are ready to offer a third track , funded with 16 billion pounds worth of private investment .

facebook is worth the investment of such a move , according to the advertisements , which will still provide sufficient income .

over the last five years , two similar cases have shown that drivers would not be held responsible for .
the newspaper reported that in both cases ( both in the dark , a person was driving a toll road ) , the drivers were not waiting for the to cross the highway in the middle of the night to the verdict was normal .
last year , he was found not guilty of causing death due to the negligence of a police officer who left a man on the road near the a1 in august 2014 .
court , said the 22-year-old victim was drinking and was leaking on the road .
in response to an emergency call , the court found that the police officer used the tool in a reasonable manner and found a man on the road was &quot; totally exceptional and unpredictable situation . &quot;
those who had knowledge of this incident , which took place near morges on thursday , should look at the police from 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 .
nasa climate model : venus was once the place to live
the new nasa climate model estimates , venus once in life , there were conditions are appropriate .
the at nasa goddard institute for space studies have developed a model to explore the past of venus using similar tools and hormones used by climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine whether venus is home to conditions similar to those in the world at once , with its warm , nonviolent surface and atmosphere filled with co2 .
in the past , scientists have been unable to explain the low return pace of venus with a thick layer of the atmosphere .
the newest estimates , however , are that , when venus is thin , the world may have had a similar atmosphere and may still be able to slow down .
the model also looked at the topography of the old venus .
the planet is more dry in the world than the world exists but once enough water and geographical volatility may have been to protect against rapid evaporation .
old venus , at the same time , was taking advantage of a 30 percent more unpleasant sun .
in a news release , giss scientist anthony del genio said in a news release that the &quot; giss model simulates the slow return of venus every time for almost two months to the day side of the looking to the sun . &quot;
this is reflected in the surface of the earth by acting like an umbrella that protects against the sun from the thick cloud layers that cause rain .
as a result , today the world is only a few degrees more than the average climate temperatures cold .
the model provided the creation of a story similar to the evolution that had previously been put forward by the planet scientists for venus .
even though it has always been suitable conditions are appropriate for life , has been exposed to sunlight too much of in a few billion years in the process and .
the ocean was evaporated , with no steam to , and it was destroyed by the water cooler .
hydrogen has been sold out and left behind only with the deadly greenhouse gas effect of carbon dioxide in a thick atmosphere ; that is , as we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of the new venus climate model in a geophysical research article .
patrick roy has resigned from the avalanche antenna , avaphantenist resigns
patrick roy said the team has not been made in the decision-making process , and vice president of hockey of the colorado avalanche coach and vice hooker operations on thursday , .
joe sakic , a colorado executive vice president / general manager of the , has approved this development and said the club will begin looking for a new coaches immediately .

north sea oil workers suspend strike , resume talks by suspending the
north sea oil workers have been suspended from the strike due to the fee , and the top negotiators have begun discussions for a new round of talks .
the strike against the oil field services company wood group operated by royal dutch shell is gradually being carried out on platforms in the north sea .
&quot; we have decided to restart the process for resolving the current dispute with wood group and as rmt unions , &quot; a joint statement said .
over the next few weeks , we will be holding a series of meetings all day to introduce a new perspective on the problems starting at the beginning of next week .
labour unions have said that this protest against wage cuts could reach 30 per cent , the first actions since 25 years .
wood group has cut nearly 9 per cent in payments to contractors in the north sea this year due to negative pressures on the market .
the company &apos;s has been on a 10 per cent price reduction to shore contractors in 2014 , following the process of reducing this fee .
the company said additional cuts would provide space for the company to recover from the stressful period in the market .
shell has been in the process of a merger with british energy company bg group , which has laid off thousands of people and announced plans to lay off oil and gas operations in operations in the country by up to 10 percent .
the energy companies are under pressure due to the low crude oil prices , an economic situation is an economic situation in which a decision was made to leave the european union in june .
dave kerr , a member of parliament , met with workers leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the largest worker conflicts in the north sea .
north sea , as he was quoted as saying , is vital for the regional economy .
&quot; we need an effective economy for the majority , not for the minority across the north sea and across the country , &quot; he said .
despite an average of nearly $ 7 billion in investment in the last five years , it is expected that in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion will be invested in new projects in the north sea .
kepler spacecraft measured the pace of return of stars in the ulker team championship
the kepler space telescope has helped astronomers with the latest mission to create the most complete catalogue in terms of the return of stars in the ulker team stars .
with the new data , astronomers have shown that the number of stars in the sky is variable quickly , and the return periods are helping to understand the interest of the planet formation .
luisa reeves , a research scientist at caltech center for work and analysis in pasadena , calif . , said in a news release , &quot; when we compare our results to star clusters , we hope to learn more about the relationship between stars , age and even the history of the solar system . &quot;
ultimately the team star swept away 445 light years away .
the team of stars in most of the stars has become 125 million years ago , and the new level of new access .
they &apos;re going to return at the highest speed , that may be in their lives .
peak in return , this maturity phase stars a large amount of star wind .
this accelerator has broken influence on the stars in the magnetic fields of stars as the .
the rate of return as a star starts to fall .
kepler said the speed of the return of each of the stars can make the difference , such as the sun , by the time between the outlook of the star .
the latest return rates catalogue suggests that the larger stars are returned faster than the smaller stars .
practically speaking , the stars are the big ones who are likened to the dancers only on their way to the small to more slowly .
&quot; we see that those who return to the locker room are much more severe , faster than those who return , &quot; he said .
ultimately the team star is very close to the star characteristics of the return with an ideal cosmic laboratory task .
&quot; ultimately , the team stars as young and old as theoretical models for star returns in both directions for , &quot; he said .
looking at the speed of the stars , how , when , and why , the one who fell to the plate in their dance shoes is one more thing we want to learn about .
the find and colleagues of the ulker team stars with the newest analysis on the rates of return speeds of the , which will be published in astronomy magazine as detailed in three new essays .
