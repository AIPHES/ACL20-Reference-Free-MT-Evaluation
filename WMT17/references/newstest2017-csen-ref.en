28-year-old chef found dead at san francisco mall
a 28-year-old chef who had recently moved to san francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall this week .
but the victim &apos;s brother says he can &apos;t think of anyone who would want to hurt him , saying , &quot; things were finally going well for him . &quot;
the body found at the westfield mall wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old san francisco resident frank galicia , the san francisco medical examiner &apos;s office said .
the san francisco police department said the death was ruled a homicide and an investigation is ongoing .
the victim &apos;s brother , louis galicia , told abc station kgo in san francisco that frank , previously a line cook in boston , had landed his dream job as line chef at san francisco &apos;s sons &amp; daughters restaurant six months ago .
a spokesperson for sons &amp; daughters said they were &quot; shocked and devastated &quot; by his death .
&quot; we are a small team that operates like a close knit family and he will be dearly missed , &quot; the spokesperson said .
our thoughts and condolences are with frank &apos;s family and friends at this difficult time .
louis galicia said frank initially stayed in hostels , but recently , &quot; things were finally going well for him . &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he was dating a girl , &quot; louis galicia told kgo .
louis galicia said he could not think of anyone who would want to hurt his younger brother .
he was a kind spirit with a big heart .
his way of connecting with the family was always making us a dish , making us dinner , &quot; louis galicia said .
he never wanted to be in any kind of altercation .
he was the brother that went with the flow .
&quot; with everything else that &apos;s going wrong with the world , he was that diamond in the rough that was shining bright every day , &quot; he said .

České dráhy has invested over 31 billion in the modernisation of carriages .
they are now equipped with air conditioning and new toilets .
over the past six years , the state-owned rail operator has invested over 31 billion czech crowns in the upgrade of train carriages .
one-third of the carriages is currently equipped with air conditioning , and roughly one-half of trains has a closed toilet system .
save for 2012 , the annual amounts spent on modernisation have been steadily decreasing .
over the past six years , czech railways invested over 31 billion in the modernisation of carriages .
the state-owned carrier operates over two thousand locomotives , electric and diesel units and about 2,130 passenger carriages .
as a result of the investment , the average age of locomotives and separate units has been reduced by two years and that of conventional carriages by six years .
with 60 percent , the carrier spent a larger portion of the investment on regional transport , with 40 percent going into the upgrade of long-distance carriages .
the average age of locomotives and units currently stands at 19 years .
however , upgraded older carriages are counted towards the indicator as brand new .
without the upgraded vehicles , the average age of traction vehicles of Čd would increase by ten years .
the average age of passenger carriages tends to be higher . if the upgraded carriages are counted , the average age is 23 years .
however , taking into account only the age based on the date of manufacture , the average age of these carriages would be 33.4 years .
conventional trains consisting of carriages and hauled by locomotives are gradually disappearing from railways not only in the czech republic but worldwide and replaced by motorised or electric-powered units .
between 2011 and 2015 , the number of locomotives decreased from 280 to 223 units , and the number of conventional carriages dropped from 2,716 in 2011 to 2,132 in the middle of this year .
the railway operator is mainly getting rid of older carriages fitted with faux leather seats and without a locking system to prevent doors from opening when the train is moving .
from january to july , the operator has had 110 of these carriages scrapped .
the rolling stock investment of Čd includes , for example , the purchase of 50 carriages for speeds up to 200 kilometres per hour , which the operator plans to use on the line prague - bratislava - budapest , or a master agreement for the purchase of electric-powered units for domestic express railway links .
under the contract , it plans to purchase up to 30 motorised units and up to 20 electric-powered units .
the authorities have known about illegal advertising for several months but they seem powerless to stop it .
the authorities themselves admitted as much .
the editorial staff of the online news provider aktuálně.cz has been following the story of a billboard in southern bohemia , which now woos motorists to visit lipno to take a stroll among the treetops or through the olympic park .
the motorway operators know that it is there illegally , but claim there is nothing they can do about it .
there are hundreds , perhaps thousands of similar ads all across the country .
officials blame a weak law , which does not provide for the immediate removal of illegal billboards ,
and having to go through a bureaucratic exercise first .
what happens in the meantime is that the company changes its name and evades the authorities .
alternatively , the company moves the billboard by a few meters , and the authorities have to start again from square one .
the road and motorway directorate admitted a few months ago that there was an illegal billboard on their property near the busy national road between České budějovice and the lipno dam .
even in three months , the officials have not managed to have the illegal portable construction and the giant advertisement taken down .
it seems as if nobody cared that it was standing right next to the road , in the fifty-metre protection zone , which must be kept free for safety reasons .
road operators argue that they cannot deal with the billboard because of legal loopholes .
an option would be simply to load in onto a truck and take it away .
&quot; this is not something we can just go ahead and do &quot; said the spokeswoman of the road and motorway directorate , nina ledvinová referring to a complex bureaucratic process which must be followed before the billboard can be removed .
the case of this particular billboard , the fate of which aktuálně.cz started monitoring in spring , is not unique and points to a general problem which the authorities are unable to handle effectively and efficiently .
in south bohemia alone , the editorial staff found dozens of similar portable adverts located illegally alongside the road or in its close proximity .
the situation in other regions is similar .
&quot; we find it difficult to force companies to remove the billboards , &quot; said the head of the transport department of the regional authority in České budějovice jiří klása , whose colleagues are handling similar cases .
according to klása , loopholes in the law which ties the hands of officials are to blame .
first , they are required to contact the billboard owners in a bureaucratic way to remove the advert .
the bosses of the companies are often impossible to get hold of or they use the trick , aktuálně.cz already reported on when they looked into the matter : move the portable stand with advert just a few metres away and the order to remove the illegal billboard is not worth the paper it is written on .
this is because the authority is required to specify the location of the illegal billboard .
&quot; if someone moves it and the coordinates change it is considered to be a new billboard , and we have to approach the owner again , &quot; said klasa .
a new law will not help us in this instance .
the situation could change with a new law , which will ban billboards next to motorways and reduce their numbers near to first-class roads .
critics point out that the rules for combating illegal and portable adverts will remain the same as before .
this will not really help the authorities .
companies can continue renting out illegal advertising space and make tens to hundreds million czech crowns a year and get away with it .
for example , the billboard promoting lipno is owned by commerz billboard .
officials are familiar with this company as the municipality of České budějovice is currently conducting three separate administrative proceedings against the company for illegal billboards .
the company could be fined up to three hundred thousand czech crowns in each case .
this concerns a number of adverts placed illegally within the protection zone of a class 1 road .
the proceedings have not yet been completed , said jaroslav mráz , said the head of the transport department of the municipality of České budějovice .
while the billboard followed by aktuálně.cz is not yet among these cases , this is likely to change soon .
according to the spokeswoman of the road and motorway directorate , nina ledvinová , the company does not respond to repeated written demands and the case will in all likelihood land on the table of regional and later municipal authorities .
commerz billboard is among the suspicious companies that are difficult to contact .
the company does not collect its mail and it has closed its official headquarters in Žižkov more than six years ago .
it is also not clear who is behind this company .
in the past , the company &apos;s mail was sent to the south bohemian entrepreneur anton fischer , whose claim to fame is the bitter dispute with the head of the czech representation of hyundai .
fischer , whose company euro billboard rents space from comerz billboard and offers it to advertisers , has , however , denied having any connection to it .
yet this spring , when the road and motorway directorate started to look into the lipno billboard case at the initiative of aktuálně.cz , fischer had the government officials send a letter to the mysterious company commerz billboard to his guest house , where the company is said to have its new address .
the motorway operators have not had any luck with contacting the company at this address either .
this seems to be a futile exercise .
lack of transparency with respect to the change of addresses are not uncommon ..
a few years ago , we fined one company two million czech crowns in total .
the company then changed its company id number , and that was it .
the bailiff returned the case , the billboards were still there , maybe in other locations .
we are quite powerless against such companies and their business practices .
it is like fighting windmills , admitted one of the officials on condition of anonymity .
nobody is yet looking to amend the law .
aktuálně.cz spoke with several mps , who have shown interest in the problem ,
but so far we have not seen any action from them .
in contrast , there are now mps , who want to extend the period for keeping the billboards next to major czech roads .
the government has rejected it .
billboards are a sensitive topic for many politicians on national , regional and local level , and they are often torn over the issue .
on the one hand , they know that people want to see less of them , but on the other , they themselves need them for election campaign advertising .
i do not share the relatively widespread view that the universal remedy when something does not work is to change the law .
statisticians estimate that this year , farmers will harvest less grain and more rapeseed and poppy .
according to the estimates of the czech statistical office , the grain harvest will be 6.7 percent lower compared to last year .
this year &apos;s harvest will still be higher than the average over the past five to ten years .
in contrast , the harvest of rapeseed and poppy is expected to increase by 3.9 and 2.5 percent , respectively .
the harvest of grains will be 6.7 percent lower than last year .
farmers are expected to harvest 7.2 million tonnes of grain .
this follows from the estimate as at 15 july , released by the czech statistical office .
the initial estimate released a month ago was more pessimistic as it assumed a 10 percent drop compared to last year .
last year &apos;s harvest of cereals was above average .
this year &apos;s harvest exceeds the average for the last five to ten years .
in contrast , the harvest of rapeseed and the poppy is expected to be higher this year .
this year , the rapeseed harvest is expected to be 3.9 percent higher than the 1.256 million tonnes harvested last year .
this year &apos;s poppy harvest could increase by 2.5 percent year-on-year .
the projected decline in grain harvest is due to a decrease in planted areas as well as a reduction in the yield per hectare by 3.7 percent to 5.71 tonnes per hectare .
this year , planted areas decreased by three percent .
the harvest of winter wheat , which is the most important grain in the czech republic , is expected to drop by 3.3 this year .
this is despite the fact that the areas planted under winter wheat have increased .
the decline is due to a lower yield per hectare , which is expected to drop to 6.04 tonnes .
czech statistical office projects roughly a one-fifth decline in spring barley , which is mainly used in the production of beer .
this is attributable to a 15.2 percent reduction in planted areas and a lower per hectare yield .
in contrast , the harvest of winter barley is estimated to grow by 6.3 percent .
the rye harvest is also expected to be higher year-on-year .
the czech statistical office estimates rapeseed harvest to increase year-on-year to 1.305 million tonnes ,
on the back of a 7.3 percent increase in planted areas .
however , the yield per hectare will be about 3.2 percent lower than last year .
this year &apos;s rapeseed harvest is projected to be 13.3 percent higher than the ten-year average , on the back of a one-third increase in planted areas .
the area planted with poppy seed has also increased over the past four years
to reach 35,543 hectares this year .
compared to 2008 , when poppy seed was planted on a record area of 70,000 hectares , the planted area has halved .
thanks to the increase in sown areas , this year &apos;s poppy harvest is expected to be a success .
it will increase compared to last year by 2.5 percent to 27,423 tons .
the yield per hectare will be about 6.1 percent lower .
the police in olomouc arrested two men for an assault with a knife and machete , and the court ordered to take them into custody .
the police arrested two men , who on tuesday attacked a thirty-five-year-old man with a knife and a machete .
&quot; although the victim tried to escape , he suffered stabbing and cutting wounds which required hospital treatment and further rehabilitation , &quot; said the police spokeswoman marie Štrbáková .
the perpetrators were arrested by the police immediately after the attack .
the prosecutor filed a detention order which was upheld by the court on friday .
the men could spend between three and ten years in prison .
the police arrested two men detained on suspicion of attacking a thirty-five-year-old man with a knife and a machete in the centre of olomouc .
the attackers inflicted stabbing and cutting wounds on the victim , who required hospital treatment .
according to the police , the attack was preceded by an incident between two groups of people on tuesday noon at třída svobody .
the perpetrators ended up in custody , said marie Štrbáková , the spokeswoman of olomouc police .
this was preceded by a mass scuffle between two families outside the bar trattoria near the centre of olomouc .
following an aggressive altercation , two men attacked a thirty-five-year-old man with a knife and a machete .
although the victim tried to escape , he suffered stabbing and cutting wounds which required hospital treatment and further rehabilitation , &quot; said the police spokeswoman .
the skirmish , which attracted a lot of attention in the city centre as several police units had to intervene at the scene , was the result of a family dispute .
detectives arrested a thirty four-year-old man from slovakia and a thirty-seven-year-old man from olomouc on suspicion of attempted grievous bodily harm and disorderly conduct .
the prosecutor filed a detention order which was upheld by the court on friday , added the spokeswoman .
five years ago , a machete was used in another attack , during a mass brawl just a few dozen meters away , before the disco varna in riegrova ulice .
according to the police , a group of roughly ten armed foreigners attacked guests of a restaurant who stood in front of the entrance .
according to the police , they were holding knives , sticks and machetes .
two of the foreign attackers received a suspended sentence .
abandoned and vacant buildings in the centre of prague .
you may be surprised to find that you walk pass them every day .
one of the most striking examples of an unused and empty building are the large former headquarters of ipb in the middle of senovážné náměstí ,
which was supposed to be turned into a hotel .
so far , there has not been any progress .
we often hear how important it is to build new flats and offices in the capital .
would it not make more sense to take advantage of existing buildings , which are often protected because of their architectural or historical merit ?
right in the centre of prague in the immediate vicinity of václavské náměstí , there are several blocks of flats which remain empty despite their premium location , size and heritage status .
we have identified these properties in the city centre with the help of the project prázdnédomy.cz , which maps long-term empty properties in the czech republic .
the buildings are usually the victims of financial problems of their owners , non-transparent relationships between companies , or they are owned by the state , which is unable or unwilling to dispose of them .
the number of empty buildings in the czech republic exceeds the number of homeless people .
the initiative wants their owners to be liable for a special tax on these buildings .
this is where they almost succeeded in shooting fidel castro ; hitler &apos;s brother also lived here .
writers showed us a different malá strana .
shopping apocalypse .
deserted shopping centres in the us .

the clintons made 10.6 million dollars last year .
trump refuses to release his tax returns .
hillary clinton and her husband , the former president bill clinton earned 10.6 million dollars last year .
the clintons donated more than one million dollars to charity .
most of the clintons &apos; income - over six million dollars - was earned in paid speeches .
trump refuses to publish his tax returns .
the democratic party &apos;s nominee for president , hillary clinton published her tax returns on friday , increasing the pressure on her republican rival donald trump to do the same .
according to ap , hillary clinton and her husband , the former president bill clinton earned 10.6 million dollars last year .
most of the clintons &apos; income - over six million dollars - was earned in paid speeches made before april 2015 , when clinton launched her presidential campaign .
their tax return shows that the clintons &apos; paid an effective federal income tax rate of 34.2 percent and an effective state and local income tax rate of 9 percent .
in total , they paid an effective combined income tax rate of 43.2 percent .
trump has so far refused to publish to take this step and publish his tax returns .
there is a possibility that donald trump does not pay any taxes , clinton tweeted a few minutes after releasing her tax returns .
according to ap , hillary clinton has repeatedly talked about the secrecy surrounding trump &apos;s income not least to raise doubts , whether her opponent is really as rich as he claims .
trump is said to be worth billions of dollars .
lower net worth would damage the reputation of the republican candidate as a successful businessman .
senator tim kaine , the vice-presidential candidate and the former first lady &apos;s running mate , today released his tax returns for the past ten years .
together with his wife anne holton , he donated 7.5 percent of his income to charity and paid an effective income tax rate last year of 25.6 percent .
polio makes a return in nigeria .
the islamist militants from boko haram are against vaccinations and are blamed for killing doctors involved in the vaccination programme .
polio cases have resurfaced in nigeria .
in the northeast of the country , the government launched an emergency polio vaccination campaign in response of two infected children having been paralysed .
the vaccines were delivered by helicopters .
the islamist terrorist group boko haram , which is active in the area , was against the vaccinations and resorted even to killing doctors .
according to the world health organization ( who ) , the virus circulated there undetected .
in the northeast of nigeria , the government is planning to launch an emergency polio vaccination campaign in response of two infected children having been paralysed .
in africa , polio was last diagnosed in somalia two years ago .
the nigerian government planning on immunizing one million children in the state of borno and another four million in the neighbouring states .
ap reported that nigerian military helicopters delivered the polio vaccines quickly to the north-eastern part of the country , where the islamist terrorist group boko haram operates .
according to the world health organization ( who ) , the virus has been circulating in the area undetected for many years .
the extremist group boko haram is against vaccinations and it is blamed for killing doctors involved in the vaccination programme .
on thursday , their attacks also prevented doctors from getting to the areas where the children were diagnosed with polio .
both affected babies come with refugees from parts of nigeria newly freed from boko haram .
the director of polio eradication at who told bbc that the immunisation in nigeria will start as early as next week .
the radical islamic group boko haram operated in the state of borno for a long time .
international organisations and the government only gained access to the area at the beginning of this year after boko haram suffered considerable setbacks in this area .
nigerian health minister isaac adewole admitted that new cases of polio are a big disappointment for the country because nigeria wanted to announce next year that polio was eradicated .
who pointed out that could have been spreading among children undetected for two years .
the vaccination programme is for children under five years of age .
in 2012 , nigeria accounted for half of all new polio cases in the world .
the number of countries in which polio is endemic has decreased from 125 countries in 1988 to three areas - afghanistan , pakistan and northern nigeria .
pope met with former prostitutes in rome .
he listened to the moving stories of the women .
pope francis met with twenty former prostitutes who escaped from the gang of pimps with the help of the police .
the pope listened to their difficult life stories and urged them to look to the future with confidence .
pope francis wanted to use this meeting to draw attention to human trafficking and to call for stepping up the fight against it .
the pope met with twenty former prostitutes who were freed from the gang of pimps by the police .
according to the vatican spokesman , the head of the catholic church listened to the moving stories of the women for more than an hour and called on them to look to the future with confidence .
among the former prostitutes who visited pope francis , six women were from romania , four from albania , seven from nigeria and one each from tunisia , italy and ukraine .
the average age of the women was 30 .
according to the vatican , all these women were forced into prostitution and subjected to physical violence .
the pope wanted to use this meeting to draw attention to human trafficking and to call for stepping up the fight against it , said the pope &apos;s spokesman .
pope francis often draws attention to the fate of people on the margins of society .
on thursday , for example , he had lunch with syrian refugees who arrived in the vatican in april and in june on his invitation .
france plans tough action against breeding grounds for jihadists .
they need the assistance from the muslim community for the measures to work .
the muslim community is expected to assist the french government in the fight against radical islamism .
the government of the prime minister manuel valls is preparing fundamental changes with respect to mosques and the education of clergy .
since last december , we shut down 20 mosques and places of worship .
and other will follow , said the interior minister .
the country has over one hundred breeding grounds for jihadists .
&quot; if muslims will not help the republic to fight against those who undermine public freedoms , it will be increasingly hard for the republic to guarantee their freedom of worship , &quot; said prime minister manuel valls .
in particular , he intends to ensure that only imams trained in france are allowed to practice in mosques and other places of worship .
at the same time he wants to stop the funding of mosques from abroad .
currently , around 20 percent of the funds for the construction of new mosques comes from abroad , mainly morocco , algeria and the gulf states .
this is one of the ways how preachers get to spread radical agendas in mosques .
&quot; our country must show that islam is compatible with democracy , &quot; he added .
the key to ensuring these objectives are met should be the new french islamic foundation ,
which should act as a bridge between the secular state and the muslim minority .
no more money from abroad .
the country already has a “ foundation for islam of france ” , which was founded in 2005 by former prime minister dominique de villepin
with the objective to make the financial flows between mosques and countries that that fund their construction more transparent .
the institution was soon hit by internal divisions and rivalries .
&quot; it is a total failure , &quot; said valls recently .
in the aftermath of the attack on the charlie hebdo magazine in january 2015 , a debate over a new institution that would replace the largely defunct foundation ignited the french political scene .
this urgency has been augmented by further terrorist attacks in france carried out by radicalised islamists in the name of the islamic state .
the french interior minister bernard cazeneuve recently said that the new foundation will be created as early as in october this year .
it will have two main tasks - to ensure that mosques are funded from domestic sources and to monitor imams .
how the construction of new mosques and various educational centres will be funded is not yet clear
as several proposals are being considered .
one of them is a special fee or tax on halal food ,
which would in practice be paid by the vendors of halal food for certification .
part of this money would then go to the foundation .
another option would be for french pilgrims heading to mecca to pay a contribution of ten to twenty euros ( an equivalent of 270 - 540 czech crowns ) .
every year , around 30,000 french muslims go on this pilgrimage to saudi arabia .
but this is not all .
according to the prime minister , there should only be preachers in mosques in the future who have gone through special educational programmes at french universities .
this is designed to ensure that sermons are compatible with democracy .
we will shut down radical mosques .
the french government is currently on the war path against militants ,
and others will follow , announced recently the interior minister .
there is no place in france for those who preach hatred and do not respect the principles of our country , such as equality between women and men .
it is estimated that there are around 2,500 mosques and places of worship in the country ,
of which some 120 are thought to be under the influence of radical islam .
since 2012 , authorities have expelled about 80 of imams and dozens are currently under consideration .
not everyone is convinced , however , that the french government &apos;s steps will make a significant contribution in the fight against radicalism .
those who want to be radicalized will do so anyway ,
because it is not happening in mosques . young people are being radicalized on the internet , said severine labat , a specialist from the national centre of scientific research .
the track cyclist kelemen lost in the first round of the sprint against the french star bauge .
to advance to the 1 / 8 finals , the czech cyclist will have to do well in the repechage heat .
having qualified among the top eighteen for the sprint event at the olympic games in rio de janeiro , the track cyclist pavel kelemen lost in the first round duel against the french star grégory baugé , the defending silver medallist from the games in london .
to advance to the 1 / 8 finals , he will have to do well in the repechage heat .
of the 27 cyclists who started in this event , the top czech track cyclist finished with the fourteenth-best
200m flying lap of 9.969 seconds .
in the round of 16 he was beaten by the french cyclist baugé , who qualified in the fifth place and already has a bronze from the team sprint event in rio .
while kelemen , was trying to chase after the experienced frenchman , he made sure to advance in the next round .
jason kenny , the defending champion from london , shone again with an excellent performance .
the twenty-eight year old briton rode the third fastest 200m flying lap in history , winning the qualification in a new olympic record of 9,551 .
it was , therefore , relatively easy for him to defeat as expected maximilian levy , who qualified in the last place .
the gb men &apos;s pursuit quartet , which included bradley wiggins , has also done well as it finished the 4km race in a world record of 3 : 50.570 and advanced to the finals .
they have managed to improve their previous personal best ( 3 : 51.659 ) , which they held for four years from the olympic games in london by more than one second .
junior doctors strike : calls for fresh industrial action
representatives of junior doctors have called on their union to authorise fresh industrial action in their dispute about a new contract .
the junior doctors committee ( jdc ) of the british medical association ( bma ) is to ask its full council to back more industrial action from early september .
the jdc says ministers have failed to address concerns about the contract .
junior doctors and medical students voted in july to reject a contract deal agreed with the bma .
it was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the ballot .
in a letter to members released on twitter on thursday night , the jdc &apos;s chair ellen mccourt said the government had remained &quot; persistently silent &quot; on issues which , she said , had resulted in the contract being rejected .
she said : &quot; in light of this , the jdc executive has voted to reject the proposed new contract in full and to call for formal re-negotiations on all of your concerns . &quot;
in response to the government &apos;s silence , jdc exec has today made a formal request for a special meeting of bma council to authorise a rolling programme of escalated industrial action beginning in early september .
the dispute has led to junior doctors taking part in six strikes this year , including the first all-out stoppages in the history of the nhs .
the bma &apos;s junior doctor leader , dr johann malawana , resigned following the vote to reject the negotiated terms of the contract , which the bma had recommended .
he had told bma members the deal was a good one that should be accepted , during meetings ahead of the poll of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students .
following the vote , health secretary jeremy hunt said the contract would be imposed on medics in england .
russia and turkey : an &apos; alliance of misfits &apos; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of russia and turkey met on tuesday to shake hands and declare a formal end to an eight-month long war of words and economic sanctions .
but , as vladimir putin greeted his turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of a st. petersburg palace , i got the distinct impression that ankara wants this reconciliation the most .
there was the handshake , yes .
but mr putin &apos;s smile looked thin and he was hardly oozing warmth even by his own restrained standards .
recep tayyip erdogan by contrast talked repeatedly of his &quot; dear friend &quot; mr putin - five times , according to one report .
i lost count .
he also pledged that relations with russia would return not just to their pre-crisis level , but even higher .
the next day one newspaper here described mr erdogan as acting as if nothing bad had ever happened .
to me , his enthusiasm implied the opposite .
but a lingering coolness emanating from mr putin showed that russia &apos;s leader has forgotten nothing .
in fact , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening comments : turkey &apos;s shooting down of a russian fighter plane on the syrian border .
moscow &apos;s reaction at the time was furious .
mr putin lashed out , accusing ankara of stabbing moscow in the back .
the offence was even greater , coming from a supposed friend .
rebuilding real trust will be hard , perhaps impossible .
russian public opinion has also turned since november .
for months , state-controlled media conducted a staggering , all-out offensive against ankara .
all of a sudden , it seemed like turks were to blame for everything .
most serious were accusations from top officials that mr erdogan &apos;s own family has profited from an illegal trade in oil from areas of syria controlled by the so-called islamic state .
he &apos;s denied that emphatically .
but in st. petersburg came the official message that it &apos;s time to move on .
after all , this meeting only happened because mr putin got the apology he demanded from president erdogan .
russia could claim a victory of sorts .
for ankara the benefits of calling a truce are clear .
first and foremost , erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ousted from power last month in a failed coup .
repeat terror attacks on turkey have clearly shaken him too .
there is also an economic motive .
russian sanctions have hit hard - particularly the ban on charter flights , which usually carry several million russian tourists to the turkish coast each year .
the number has slumped by almost 90 % .
as for russia , tour operators and charter companies here will certainly be relieved when flights eventually resume .
they &apos;re banking on a late-season rush to the mediterranean .
and even this week , state tv has been predicting cheaper fruit and vegetables once turkish agricultural imports are permitted again .
&quot; tourists that way , tomatoes back here , &quot; as a report in vedemosti newspaper phrased it .
but the visit also had additional political value for moscow .
ankara is angry with the west for what it considers a weak response to the attempted takeover .
add to that its long-standing grudge at the snail &apos;s pace of talks to join the eu and step in mr putin - who is keen to capitalise on the chill and chip away at turkey &apos;s ties with the west .
the russian leader certainly won bonus points with ankara for calling in support of the elected authorities after the attempted coup .
mind you , that &apos;s a given for moscow which has its own deep-seated fear of regime change .
so the summit at this glitzy , seaside palace allowed russia and turkey to present what one analyst described to me as an &quot; alliance of misfits &quot; : two countries that feel rejected and mistreated by the west , joining forces .
still , despite the public display of reconciliation , the two still have major differences .
the key one is syria , where moscow has recently been casting itself as peacemaker but where russia and turkey back opposite sides .
it could be telling that after almost three hours of initial talks , the two presidents told a press conference that they hadn &apos;t even touched on the topic .
turkey &apos;s president deliberately avoided answering a question on their differences , while mr putin chose to underline them .
there is no clear consensus on where they can seek common ground on syria .
but after months of open hostility - and given the potential for utter disaster when nato member turkey shot down that russian fighter jet - it is surely better that the two leaders are at least talking again .
royal bank of scotland to disappear for customers outside scotland
the brand rbs is to be reduced to a back office role , according to the bank &apos;s chief executive .
royal bank of scotland will disappear for customers outside scotland .
ross mcewan told bbc scotland that the rbs brand was associated with the bank &apos;s global ambitions .
it has retreated from them since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be bailed out .
during that time , brand strategists have used &apos; rbs &apos; to protect other consumer finance brands .
it was backed with millions of pounds in sponsorship of international sport , from six nations rugby to wimbledon champion andy murray .
but now , it has been judged right to let more national brands come to the fore .
royal bank of scotland will be used with scottish customers , but will not be initialised .
in england and wales , all rbs references , outside head office and the stock exchange listing , will be changed to natwest .
the ulster bank brand is already used for customers in the republic of ireland and northern ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for private banking , which will get more prominence - coutts , adam &amp; co , drummond , and holt &apos;s military bank .
mr mcewan was interviewed during a tour of customers and staff in inverness-shire .
he told bbc scotland : &quot; the rbs brand will end up becoming our investor brand and the one that our staff are employed with , because we are now becoming much more a bank of brands . &quot;
as the bank itself became a global brand , rbs became the global brand .
i &apos;m now saying we no longer have global aspirations , we have local aspirations .
each one of those brands will stand for something quite different in their own communities , and our staff will work with customers under those brands .
rbs had already stated that it would not to continue its six nations sponsorship , and it has been raising the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship .
&quot; the time is right for us to move to the bank of brands , because underneath ( we &apos;ve been asking ) how do we focus on making this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the chief executive .
it would have been very cynical three years ago if we &apos;d said we &apos;re going to be a great bank for customers and put those brands out there .
but with the work we &apos;ve been doing , focussing on the customers needs , not our own , i think you &apos;re seeing a lot of change .
we can bring those brands back up again , so i think the time is right .
frankie dettori reaches 3,000 winners with victory at newmarket on predilection
dettori sprays champagne after a double at newmarket takes him to 3,000 wins
jockey frankie dettori secured his 3,000th british winner at newmarket on friday .
he brought up the landmark with his second winner of the night at his local track - on predilection , trained by john gosden .
the 45-year-old italian is the sixth jockey to reach the landmark in flat racing .
he follows sir gordon richards , doug smith , lester piggott , pat eddery and willie carson .
three-time champion jockey dettori , who earlier won on ghayyar , said : &quot; it &apos;s special . &quot;
i &apos;m very emotional because my family are here as well
i &apos;m very pleased for it to have happened at newmarket because this is where i landed 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not a royal ascot - it &apos;s a mundane friday night with 20,000 people .
i &apos;m relieved and very humble .
dettori soaks up the cheers as he brings in predilection after victory
two jockeys have reached the milestone in jump racing - champion jockey richard johnson and retired 20-time champion sir anthony mccoy , who had more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career .
lester piggott , nine-time derby winner , 4,493 career wins
frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era and it is no surprise he has reached this landmark so few have achieved before him .
he is stylish and strong , but it is his tactical nous that sets him apart from others in the weighing room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for racing , his enthusiasm and charisma have been drawing fans to the sport for years .
i said to frankie a few weeks ago at epsom he &apos;d have ridden 6,000 winners if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big-race jockey !
seriously though , frankie &apos;s been riding winners in the uk for the best part of 30 years which is great to see .
he &apos;s a lively character which is good for british racing but more than that , he &apos;s an incredible jockey .
frankie dettori celebrated the milestone with a trademark flying dismount
from flying finishes to flying dismounts , frankie dettori has been the poster boy of british flat racing for two decades .
it has been a rollercoaster ride .
stacks of big-race winners , including his famous 1996 &apos; magnificent seven &apos; at ascot , but he also survived a plane crash and served a drugs ban .
three years ago he initially struggled when returning from that six-month suspension , but he showed formidable strength of character to defy the doubters and return to his best .
and he may not be done for some time - dettori has previously said he would like to carry on competing until the age of 50 , at least .
russia &apos;s putin sacks chief of staff sergei ivanov
russian president vladimir putin has unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff sergei ivanov .
mr ivanov has been part of mr putin &apos;s trusted inner circle for many years .
the 63-year-old has now been made a special representative for environmental and transport issues .
a statement from the kremlin said that mr putin had &quot; decreed to relieve ivanov of his duties as head of the russian presidential administration , &quot; but gave no reason .
mr ivanov &apos;s deputy since 2012 , anton vaino , has been appointed as his successor .
mr vaino , 44 , is a former diplomat .
born in the estonian capital tallinn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious moscow state institute of international relations ( mgimo ) and served in the tokyo embassy .
later he managed presidential protocol and government staff , the kremlin website says ( in russian ) .
on being appointed , he told mr putin : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
i think the administration &apos;s most important task is to support your activity as head of state in terms of drafting laws and control over how your instructions are implemented .
mr putin told a russian tv station on friday that mr ivanov had asked to leave the post , and recommended that mr vaino should replace him .
do the smiles convince ?
this is a move that has mystified moscow .
sergei ivanov has long been one of vladimir putin &apos;s closest allies and , like him , served in the soviet security service , the kgb .
as chief of staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
in a meeting with president putin shown on state television both men claimed that the chief of staff was stepping down at his own request .
but despite the smiles for the cameras , few here are convinced - especially now , just before parliamentary elections .
so is this the fall-out from some kind of power struggle ?
no-one knows yet .
but the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president , suddenly wanted to run russia &apos;s environmental policy - has been met with great scepticism .
in remarks to mr putin , quoted on the kremlin website , mr ivanov said &quot; it &apos;s true that in early 2012 i asked you , in a conversation , to entrust me with this very complicated post , even - you could say - troublesome post , for four years .
well , it turns out that i &apos;ve been presidential chief of staff for four years and eight months .
mr ivanov took up the post in december 2011 .
he served previously as a deputy prime minister and defence minister .
he is a member of the russian security council and a former member of the kgb state security service , like mr putin .
in the late 1990s , when mr putin was head of the federal security service ( fsb ) , which replaced the kgb , mr ivanov was appointed as his deputy .
when mr putin came to power , he named mr ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most .
it was once thought that mr ivanov might become president of russia after mr putin &apos;s second term , as a third term for mr putin would have been unconstitutional .
but that post was taken by another close putin ally , dmitry medvedev .
mr putin became prime minister , before returning to the presidency just three-and-a-half years later .
criminal minds star thomas gibson sacked after hitting producer
gibson was involved in a physical altercation on the set of the show in los angeles last month .
abc studios and cbs television studios , which produce the series , announced his dismissal in a joint statement .
gibson , who played special agent aaron hotchner , issued an apology on thursday before his termination was announced .
there were creative differences on the set and a disagreement .
i regret that it occurred , &quot; he said in a statement .
details on how gibson &apos;s character will be written out of the show , which follows a team of fbi agents , is expected to come at a later date , according to the abc studios and cbs television studios statement .
the 54-year-old , who previously starred on the sitcom dharma &amp; greg , had been on the show since its first season in 2005 .
&quot; i love criminal minds and have put my heart and soul into it for the last twelve years , &quot; gibson said in a statement released on friday .
i had hoped to see it through to the end , but that won &apos;t be possible now .
i would just like to say thank you to the writers , producers , actors , our amazing crew , and , most importantly , the best fans that a show could ever hope to have .
the show is slated to return for its twelfth season on 28 september .
mystery as fish land in banff garden
a banff man has appealed for help in identifying fish that have appeared in his garden in banff .
kevin bain thinks the 75 fish could be sand eels deposited by a waterspout .
mr bain , who lives about 500m from the sea , posted footage of the spectacle on periscope in the hope someone could shed light on the appearance of the two-inch fish .
queensferry crossing : bridge now connected to fife
the £ 1.35bn project is now due to be complete by may 2017
engineers have joined the queensferry crossing &apos;s north deck and viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected to fife .
it is the first of four closures between the &quot; deck fans , &quot; which are now nearing completion around each of the bridge &apos;s three towers .
the bridge section from fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 stay-cables .
the £ 1.35bn project is now due to be complete by may 2017 .
economy secretary keith brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the land on to the bridge .
he said : &quot; this is a historic and symbolic moment in the building of the queensferry crossing .
we &apos;re all witnessing engineering on a truly epic scale on this project , with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel used just to build this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge completing the closure between the viaduct and bridge deck is a delicate operation involving extremely precise tolerances for fit up .
overall , nearly 79 % of the total bridge deck is now in place , the final section of deck is having its concrete deck cast in rosyth today , meaning all the deck is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge .
michael martin , forth crossing bridge constructors project director said : &quot; the first closure on any bridge project is always a significant milestone .
on this fantastic project , this closure represents leading edge civil engineering .
after installing the last road deck section and connecting it to the expanding north tower road deck , we then had to close the remaining gap on the north - or landward - side .
this was done by pulling the northern approach viaduct 700 millimetres southwards .
this was a massive and , at the same time , very delicate operation .
massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long , weighs approximately 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled up a gradient of about 3 % .
delicate because the tolerances the team were working to were tiny - just a few millimetres either way .
happily , it all went very well .
moelfre bay rescue : three men are &apos; lucky to be alive&apos;
three men are &quot; lucky to be alive &quot; after they were thrown from their fishing boat off anglesey .
moelfre rnli lifeboat station raised the alarm at 13 : 20 bst on friday after a crew saw the incident unfold in moelfre bay .
the three men struggled to swim to safety while their boat continued under its own power .
&quot; we saw their boat circling close to them and imagined the worst , &quot; said moelfre lifeboat helm vince jones .
&quot; fortunately , by the time we had launched , the strong winds had blown it clear of them , &quot; he added .
two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat , while the third man , aged 60 , was found exhausted and clinging to a buoy without a lifejacket .
they were all taken on board the inshore lifeboat and brought back to the lifeboat station
mr jones said : &quot; the three men thrown in the water are lucky to be alive and completely uninjured .
the boat &apos;s engine had an emergency kill cord but it had somehow come detached from the person driving the boat when it capsized .
someone was watching over these guys today .
judge refuses to deal with the case because of tluchoř &apos;s wife .
petr tluchoř is one of three mps who have been accused by the prosecution service of taking bribes in the form of lucrative positions from the then prime minister nečas and his former chief of staff jana nagyova in return for a political concession .
the mps Šnajdr , fuksa and tluchoř facilitated the passing of tax legislation
by resigning from the parliament ,
only to reappear in influential positions at state-owned companies .
this is why they were suspected of bribery and spent one month behind bars .
the court subsequently ruled that this was illegal and they received compensation amounting to nearly 2 million czech crowns .
following the intervention of the supreme court , tluchoř is now acting as a witness in the case .
his wife works in the courthouse at ovocný trh , where she handles civil disputes .
still , the judge helena králová ( editor &apos;s note : ms králová is a judge for criminal matters ) want to be careful to prevent any possible objections .
the case will , therefore , be likely handled by a different judicial district in prague .
this is despite the fact that ms králová has twice acquitted jana nečasová , formerly nagyová
for the alleged misuse of military intelligence to surveil the first wife of prime minister nečas .
tluchoř was not involved in this case .
according to the lawyer , jaroslav ortman , this is an unnecessary knee-jerk reaction .
i think that the principle of impartiality should not be interpreted in a way that would exclude a court if a witness &apos;s spouse or relative works at the courthouse .
i am afraid that this would preclude almost any prosecution , he said in a newspaper interview .
&quot; i find it completely over the top , &quot; he added .
mr tluchoř &apos;s co-accused in this case of political cronyism is roman boček , a former official .
according to his lawyer , petr toman , a potential objection may have a chance to succeed .
on 13 june , the district court for prague 1 discussed the indictment of the former chief of staff of the prime minister petr nečas , jana nagyová ( today nečasová ) and the other accused in the case of misuse of military intelligence .
ms nečasová is pictured arriving at the court with her husband .
ms tluchořová was meant to judge statements about peroutka .
the wife of the former mp was , for example , scheduled to judge a case involving the statements of the czech president , miloš zeman about the democratic pre-war journalist ferdinand peroutka .
zeman said about him that he was a hitler sympathiser .
one of the schoolgirls is dead !
the girl appears to have died in an air strike of the allied forces .
the schoolgirl travelled to syria with her two same-aged friends in february last year from london &apos;s gatwick airport .
the uk home office has not commented on the report of her death .
according to the police , the young londoners who ran away from home , were secretly taken to syria across the turkish border .
according to the media , shamima begum , amira abase and kadiza sultana went to syria to join their former schoolfriend from london &apos;s bethnal green academy .
the case has received considerable attention and led to tension in relations between the uk and turkey .
the uk &apos;s security services estimate that around 600 british muslims , including some 50 young women and girls have travelled to syria so far .
many of them have joined the is militants and other groups .
those who return home present a terrorist threat to the uk .
a dream job for six figure salary .
a well-paid job without a university degree .
this is the job of an it specialist at first sight
and often the second .
the advantage is not only the extremely high salary by czech standards ( in prague , it specialists can make up to czk 180,000 ) , but also very attractive benefits .
the reason is the enormous shortage of it specialists .
the economy needs thousands of it experts
it is estimated that the czech republic needs 20,000 it specialists .
according to the recruitment agency grafton , most sought-after are programmers , developers , network engineers and application specialists .
candidates can choose from several job offers .
the demand is considerably higher than the supply and employers compete for candidates , said jitka součková , the marketing manager of grafton recruitment .
university is not a must .
higher education is not a must for it professionals .
higher education is a good foundation and overall indicator of intelligence and education of the candidate , but it does not tend to have much in common with the knowledge of development .
developers must constantly learn new things , which cannot be substituted by just completing a university , says petr kubačka , director of monster career cz .
it professionals earn the highest salaries in prague .
it professional salaries are everywhere well above the national average .
the highest salaries are paid in prague and brno . the salaries in the regions are somewhat lagging behind .
the salary levels in brno are comparable with those in prague , &quot; says kubačka .
the highest salaries are earned by technical directors .
in prague and brno , they can make between czk 120 000 and czk 180 000 .
in other regions , the salaries are lower , but they still do not drop below czk 80 000 .
it project managers are also in demand .
upon joining , that can make between czk 60 000 and czk 100 000 .
graduates are also in demand
while some graduates have no choice but to go straight to the employment office , this does not apply to it specialists .
rather than having to attract specialists from other firms , i.a. by engaging in a bidding war , companies often prefer to hire graduates .
this is because they can train them to meet their requirements
language skills are a must
knowledge of a foreign language is useful in any profession and it guys need to have at least a decent knowledge of english .
knowledge of at least one foreign language is a must for some it positions .
on the other hand , we often come across companies , which are looking for skilled and experienced professionals with only an average knowledge of english .
according to the company &apos;s director mr kubačka , it is an advantage for an it support employee to be able to communicate in several languages because this allows him to serve more customers from different countries .
yes , google is heaven .
czech employees can only envy google staff .
they enjoy flexible working hours , option to work from home or a range of part-time opportunities , not only for mothers .
&quot; google offers new dads four extra weeks of holidays following the birth of their child , &quot; said martina joneková , a spokeswoman for google .
other benefits include healthcare for employees and their families , meals , transport , training , wellness or massages at the workplace .
green light is given to those who want to continue learning irrespective of the subject .
the benefits do not stop there .
a well-stocked fridge for free is also quite something .
healthy lunches ( in some localities also breakfasts and dinners ) are available at the workplace every day .
in addition , all offices feature so-called micro-kitchens , which are always well stocked with healthy snacks , revealed the spokeswoman .
to prevent waste , the employees can take home any leftovers in the evening .
and the reason for these benefits unheard of by czech standards ?
create a creative and motivating environment !
&quot; we at google want to promote initiatives and projects , progress or development , ideas and innovative solutions rather than having employees sitting in the office for eight hours a day , &quot; added the spokeswoman .
un has sharply criticised bulgaria for criminalising refugees .
mr zeid ra &apos;ad al hussein , un high commissioner for human rights , accused bulgaria on thursday of systematically violating human rights by criminalising refugees .
the official strategy of the bulgarian government &quot; raises serious concerns about bulgaria &apos;s lack of respect for international law , &quot; warned mr zeid ra &apos;ad al hussein .
he pointed out that &quot; it is particularly worrying to witness how important and influential public figures have publicly expressed support for armed criminal outfits that brazenly organise refugee-hunting patrols along the bulgarian-turkish border . &quot;
&quot; one of the most serious problems is that almost all people who cross the border to bulgaria irregularly are being automatically arrested , &quot; said zeid .
what is worse - they are often prosecuted and jailed - for a year or longer - if they attempt to leave the country .
their attempts to leave the country are criminalised , despite the fact that under international law , everyone has the right to leave any country , including their own .
this year , bulgaria arrested 14,000 migrants , last year over the same period , it was 21,000 .
pokémon go a worthy hunt for health and happiness
it is fascinating to see how the world turns .
that teenagers and children do not get outside to play any more , preferring to spend their free time looking at screens , has been the lament of many for the the past decade .
pokemon go is getting people off the couch and into some activity .
screen time was initially limited to the television then video games and more recently smartphones .
so it is great to see that technology and being active outdoors are not mutually exclusive .
i am of course referring to the craze that is pokémon go , an app based on the characters first created for video games in the 1990s ( it later spawned a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin offs ) .
like many pop cultural phenomena it had gone off the boil somewhat before this new game was made available in the us , australia and new zealand in early july .
the launch in other countries was then delayed by the massive response , which overloaded servers .
within days , pokémon go had more users than tinder and nearly as many as twitter .
so how does it work ?
in a nutshell , players on smartphones go out looking for pokémons , which are tracked with a gps and , once found , can be &apos; photographed &apos; ( via a screenshot on your phone ) or &apos; captured &apos; .
a generation who played the game when younger have joined the craze , jumping off the couch for the search .
in the us , the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by the &quot; average &quot; person each day .
cardiogram , an app for the apple watch that tracks 35,000 users , told the washington post recently that within two days of the game launching , the number of people it tracked who did 30 minutes of exercise each day jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent .
the company does not know who is playing pokémon go - it just sees raw data on exercise levels .
many public health campaigns to get people to &quot; find 30 , &quot; &quot; get off the couch &quot; and &quot; be active everyday &quot; have fallen on deaf ears because most public health messages are boring and delivered by people who look miserable .
yet the importance of exercise cannot be understated .
those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of getting cancer or depression .
activity helps with weight management , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits too long to list here .
but the beauty of pokémon go is it gets people outside doing something they enjoy .
thus you are covering three pillars of health - movement , fresh air and sunshine , and fun .
some people are even making new friends on the hunt .
as usual there are po-faced killjoys looking for something to complain about .
and yes somebody might walk into a door .
so what ?
a breakthrough has occurred .
for while smartphone apps like fitbit could previously track our activity , they didn &apos;t give us a reason to exercise like this game does .
the novelty will wear off and use will subside in due course .
however because of pokmeon &apos;s success there will be more games that combine apps and virtual reality with being active in the real world , helping many people on the hunt to be more active , fitter and healthier .

simone biles nails all-around gold in women &apos;s gymnastics
forget the pressure .
forget the hype .
simone biles is immune to all of it .
dynamic on vault .
effortless on beam .
jaw-dropping on floor .
brilliant all over .
and now , finally , an olympic champion .
the 19-year-old american gymnast soared to the all-around title on thursday , putting the gap between herself and the rest of the world on full display under the olympic spotlight .
her total of 62.198 was well clear of silver medalist and &quot; final five &quot; teammate aly raisman and russian bronze medalist aliya mustafina .
united states &apos; simone biles performs on the balance beam during the artistic gymnastics women &apos;s individual all-around final at the 2016 summer olympics in rio de janeiro , brazil , thursday .
biles became the fourth straight american woman to win the all-around title and fifth overall while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever .
she burst into tears when her final total was posted and her long journey to this moment ended .
the achievement puts her in the same league as once-in-a-generation athletes like michael phelps who have taken their sports to new heights :
biles has spent the last three years dominating her sport , winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold - with routines so astonishing in their mix of ambition and precision that 1984 olympic champion mary lou retton called her &quot; the greatest gymnast i &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
one last test awaited in brazil , a contest not so much between biles and the rest of the field but between herself and the burden of oversized expectations .
anything less than heading back to her family &apos;s home in spring , texas , with a fistful of golds would be seen as a disappointment .
united states &apos; simone biles , left , and aly raisman embrace after winning gold and silver respectively for the artistic gymnastics women &apos;s individual all-around final at the 2016 summer olympics in rio de janeiro , brazil , thursday , aug .
biles earned the first one on tuesday while serving as the exclamation point to retiring national team coordinator martha karolyi &apos;s going away party .
while biles insisted she &apos;s never looked ahead during her long run at the top , that &apos;s not exactly true .
a portion of her floor exercise routine - the one that includes her signature tumbling pass - is set to latin music that would fit right at home in the street right outside the rio olympic arena .
it &apos;s not a coincidence .
the girl adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and discovered by coach aimee boorman &apos;s mother during a field trip to the gym where boorman was coaching has become a force .
she hasn &apos;t lost an all-around competition since the summer of 2013 , a winning streak that should go for as long as biles wants it to .
though mustafina took a small lead through two rotations , it was a mirage .
balance beam and floor exercise - where biles is the defending world champion - lay in wait .
she went back in front with a 15.433 on beam - and capped it with a 15.933 on floor .
raisman hugged her gently as they awaited the final score - a mere formality - and tears appeared around biles &apos; glittery red , white and blue eyeliner when the vision she once wrote in a scrapbook became a reality .
raisman &apos;s performance was a bit of revenge from four years ago , when she tied for third but lost the bronze to mustafina on a tiebreaker .
this time , the 22-year-old team captain the americans call &quot; grandma &quot; was well ahead .
she blew kisses to the crowd after her floor exercise , overcome by a comeback that at times seemed in doubt .
as for biles , the 19-year-old &apos;s viral tweet from earlier this week now carries a whole new meaning :
police : 3 victims in serial killer case shot while listening to music in car
two women and a 12-year-old girl who died in the deadliest attack in phoenix &apos;s first serial killer case in a decade were sitting in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot , according to police reports released thursday .
angela rochelle liner , stefanie r. ellis and ellis &apos; daughter maleah were shot on june 12 while the car was parked in a driveway , authorities said .
the gunman fired as many as eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car then fled in another vehicle , the report states .
police say the triple killing doesn &apos;t appear to have been the result of a robbery because the attacker didn &apos;t take purses or $ 2,900 in the possession of one of the adult victims .
phoenix police spokesman sgt. jonathan howard said the shooting prompted investigators to look at whether it was tied to four earlier attacks .
in all , seven people have been killed and two others wounded in nine attacks in two predominantly hispanic neighborhoods over a four-month period .
&quot; it &apos;s occurring within a residential area in front of a home , &quot; howard said to cbs affiliate kpho earlier this month .
the suspect is believed to have used several vehicles , including as a late-1990s brown nissan , a late-1990s black bmw and a white cadillac or lincoln .
investigators have declined to reveal the evidence that led them to conclude the attacks are related and committed by the same killer .
ellis , 33 , was hospitalized for her injuries and later died .
liner , 31 , and ellis &apos; daughter maleah died at the scene .
a witness told police that it wasn &apos;t unusual for them to sit in a parked car listening to music .
authorities also released a police report on a shooting that targeted an unoccupied pickup truck just a half-hour before the triple killing and is believed to have been the work of the serial killer .
investigators found bullet casings and recovered a bullet from a seat and bullet fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of 6-year-old with microcephaly : &quot; it gets better &quot;
like most six-year-olds , edmund picciuto loves singing , toys and , of course , his mother .
but unlike most of his peers , edmund has microcephaly , the result of a genetic disorder his mom elizabeth picciuto didn &apos;t know about while pregnant .
when he first came home my initial thought was , i can &apos;t do this .
i can &apos;t do this .
i didn &apos;t sign up for this .
which is not true at all -- of course you sign up for it , &quot; she said .
she and her husband , vincent , were told edmund might never recognize them , and that he might not even survive .
some doctors went as far as suggesting he be institutionalized .
&quot; my first response was &apos; i didn &apos;t think people did that anymore , &apos; &quot; picciuto explained .
edmund walks with the help of a walker .
edmund didn &apos;t sit up or crawl until he was three , and he still doesn &apos;t talk .
but he &apos;s slowly meeting some milestones .
he &apos;s walking with help , and riding a bike .
he also loves playing with his two brothers , and singing .
elizabeth demonstrates the sign language edmund made up for &quot; please sing to me . &quot;
&quot; we &apos;re teaching him sign language , &quot; picciuto told cbs news .
but it &apos;s not just typical sign language -- she says edmund has invented some of his own signs .
microcephaly can arise from a number of different conditions : genetic ones like edmund &apos;s , and infections during pregnancy from viruses like measles and zika .
symptoms and prognosis can vary widely .
it &apos;s too early to tell how it will affect the lives of those infected with zika .
picciuto remembers the emotional toll of an uncertain future .
i kept saying , what &apos;s going to happen ?
what &apos;s going to happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t really know .
i actually haven &apos;t asked for a prognosis in forever , because i don &apos;t expect anyone to really be able to tell me .
but picciuto has hopeful advice for the mothers of babies with birth defects from zika .
it gets better .
you know it will get better for you .
you will love your child , and your child will love you .
heavy rain , flooding prompts rescues in louisiana , mississippi
heavy rain and widespread flooding in louisiana lead the governor to declare a state of emergency on friday , with more rain expected over the state through saturday .
numerous rivers in southeast louisiana and southern mississippi were overflowing their banks and threatening widespread flooding after extreme rainfall , the national weather service reported .
louisiana gov. john bel edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local officials , and assistance is already on the move to affected parishes .
mike steele , a spokesman for the governor &apos;s office of homeland security and emergency preparedness , said requests were coming in for high-water vehicles , boats and sandbags .
steele said tangipahoa parish alone requested tens of thousands of sandbags .
a flood watch remains in effect until saturday across most of south louisiana .
the weather service said in a statement that an additional 3 to 5 inches could fall over the area .
in south alabama , a flood watch was in effect friday as rain continued in the mobile area .
the comite river near baton rouge and amite river near denham springs , both in louisiana , were predicted to set record crests over the weekend .
forecaster alek krautmann said both rivers could flood many houses in suburban areas near baton rouge .
he also said that flooding downstream in ascension parish is a threat , as those swollen rivers will be slow to drain into lake maurepas .
the tickfaw river , just south of the mississippi state line in liverpool , louisiana , was already at the highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. friday .
rescuers were still plucking people from floodwaters in amite and wilkinson counties in southwest mississippi .
leroy hansford , his wife and stepson were among those rescued earlier friday near gloster .
hansford , 62 , says waters from beaver creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , rose quickly overnight .
he said another stepson who lives nearby alerted him .
&quot; we woke up and the water kept on coming , &quot; hansford said .
it came up to my waist .
his wife told hansford that it &apos;s the highest she &apos;s seen the creek in the 48 years she &apos;s lived there .
hansford said he and his family members all have disabilities , and he &apos;s the only one who can swim .
hansford said emergency workers rescued all three in a large military-style truck and took them to the fire station in gloster , where they were sheltering friday .
krautmann says flooding is &quot; quickly becoming widespread &quot; as heavy rains continue , saying officials are considering evacuation orders .
krautmann says one observer near livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to friday morning .
krautmann said the ground was heavily saturated by rainfall since wednesday .
heavy rain and street flooding prompted the rescue of residents from their homes in tangipahoa parish and the cancellation of classes in five school districts , authorities said .
cbs affiliate wwl reports that an alderwoman in tangipahoa said 200 homes flooded .
residents had been evacuated to two churches but both are now flooding .
parish president robby miller said authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets stranded by high water .
shelters have been opened in the town of amite and the city of hammond to house those who were evacuated .
&quot; they will be allowed to return home once the water starts to recede , &quot; he said .
in the tangipahoa parish city of hammond , close to two dozen streets were closed because of high water , and sandbags were made available for pickup by residents hoping to keep water out of homes and businesses .
&quot; the last major flood we had was in march , &quot; said city administrator lacy landrum .
this one is on track to be a similar event .
in mississippi , harrison county emergency manager rupert lacy said steady rain continued on the gulf coast .
he said a handful of houses were reported as flooded thursday , but none have been reported so far friday .
keith townson , manager of shopper value foods in amite , has lived in the area for 40 years .
&quot; i &apos;ve seen water in some places i have never seen before , &quot; townson said , &quot; and it &apos;s still coming down . &quot;
mahaj brown , 6 , &quot; riddled with bullets , &quot; survives philadelphia shooting
police say a 6-year-old boy has been shot in philadelphia , marking the second shooting of a 6-year-old in the city this week .
the child &apos;s grandparents identified him to cbs philadelphia as mahaj brown .
the grandparents say brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds , including in his groin , leg , arm and abdomen , but was awake when he was transported to the hospital .
&quot; he just took a lot , his little body was riddled with bullets , &quot; his grandmother delores melendez tells the station .
i just can &apos;t believe it .
the boy is listed in critical condition at a hospital and has undergone several surgeries .
family tells the station he is expected to recover .
he was set to start first grade at a local elementary school .
brown was among four people shot in the germantown section .
also shot were three men : two 29-year-olds and one 32-year old .
one of the 29-year-old men was reported in critical condition ; the other two victims were listed in stable condition , according to cbs philadelphia .
the child was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old in critical condition , the station reports .
the other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be a shooter .
investigators tells cbs philadelphia it appears there was crossfire between multiple gunmen .
assault weapon-style shell casings , traced to different assault style weapons , littered the scene .
it appears that this was definitely an ongoing battle .
there were casings in the street , on both sides of the sidewalk .
so it appears that there were multiple armed combatants out here and that they were actively engaged , &quot; philadelphia police captain anthony ginaldi told the station .
multiple houses and vehicles in the area were also struck .
no arrests have been made and police are reportedly reviewing surveillance video .
another 6-year-old , a girl , was hit in her arm by a stray bullet tuesday while playing in front of her home in the west oak lane neighborhood .
she is recovering , and police are still searching for a suspect .
why we need simone , gabby and laurie
that &apos;s what i call this year &apos;s women &apos;s olympic gymnastics team and for more reasons than one .
first , i have been to every summer olympics since 1984 and the usa has never been so dominant .
and second : this team features three gymnasts , simone biles , gabby douglas and lauren &quot; laurie &quot; hernandez , who have been inspiring so many young girls of color .
the make-up of this team , rounded out by aly raisman , who is jewish , and madison kocian , who is catholic , is making everyone proud .
this team looks , finally , like america .
it also has solidified the black and latina female presence at the top of this sport .
for the past four years , the number one female gymnast has been african-american .
last year , simone and gabby were # 1 and # 2 .
this is powerful .
last olympics , gabby douglas was a surprise olympic champion , and america cheered .
now the world has been able to witness the incredible performances of three-time world champion simone biles , douglas and laurie hernandez delivering the unexpected , yet masterful gymnastics routines .
on thursday , simone became the fourth straight american to win gold in the women &apos;s individual all-around event .
and teammate aly raisman earned silver .
we are witnessing the top of the sport , but it does not look like this at gymnastics classes across the country .
simone , gabby and laurie all took the same path as aly and madison to make the olympic team .
they are the &quot; final five &quot; because the next olympic gymnastics team will only have four gymnasts on the team , and this is marta karolyi &apos;s last year coaching .
but the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport , and gymnasts primarily train in private gymnastics clubs that are maintained by parents paying the cost of the training , facility , travel , uniforms , competition fees , hotel fees ( for the coaches and their gymnasts and families ) and the list goes on .
most of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburban neighborhoods that can support the business .
these clubs are where the gymnasts get all of their training , and it &apos;s a costly and long-term commitment for the gymnasts &apos; families .
aimee boorman , coach of simone biles , and maggie haney , coach of laurie hernandez , have both coached their athletes since they started in gymnastics .
we must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to the communities of countless young girls who are inspired by simone , gabby and laurie .
i founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago .
at my organizations , we have provided free and low-cost gymnastics , based in harlem , for over 15,000 urban youth ( primarily black and hispanic ) and have trained national and international champions .
in september , we will be expanding to detroit ( my hometown ) to provide high quality gymnastics to the youth that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great olympic sport .
gymnastics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body and hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination provides life-long benefits for good health , success in school and work .
it is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of young girls to take gymnastics and that is great .
to participate in sport is so important , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank you simone , aly , laurie , gabby and madison for that serious showcase of &quot; girl power &quot; in winning the olympic team gold and for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to begin their path to be healthy , strong and successful young women .
junior doctors set to mount further strikes after rejecting jeremy hunt &apos;s proposal
ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with british medical association officials , but 58 per cent of the 37,000 junior doctors who took part in a ballot had rejected it .
in july , mr hunt revealed plans to impose the contract saying the nhs was in &quot; no man &apos;s land &quot; and any further delay would be damaging for staff and patients .
the first junior doctors are moved onto the new contract , which includes changes to overnight and weekend working practices to improve care at unsociable hours .
dr ellen mccourt , the bma &apos;s junior doctors &quot; committee chair , said in a statement last night : &quot; junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract , particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis , and that it fails to treat all doctors fairly . &quot;
with just eight weeks before the first group of doctors are moved onto the new contract , progress needs to be made and time is running out .
efforts by the bma to resolve the dispute through talks have been met with an unwillingness to engage and , at times , deafening silence from the government .
this is despite a promise from jeremy hunt just last month that his door is always open .
&quot; jeremy hunt needs to act now , lift the imposition and address junior doctors &quot; concerns .
if he does not then junior doctors are clear that they are prepared to take further industrial action .
the last strike at the end of april saw the postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments as nurses and consultants were drafted in to provide cover for doctors on the picket line .
ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with british medical association officials .
the bma wants better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors who would be subject of the contract .
daniel mortimer , chief executive of nhs employers , called on junior doctors not to go ahead with any strikes .
mr mortimer said : &quot; industrial action achieves little or nothing , but places pressure on already stretched teams and services and causes worry , distress and disruption for patients , carers and their families . &quot;
over the last two months we have been talking with the junior doctors committee and have , along with the department of health and others , responded positively to their concerns regarding the guardian role and whistleblowing .
employers were hopeful that the continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as deployment , flexibility in training , additional training for those returning from career breaks , costs of training , mutual recognition of syllabus , study leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers , health education england and the department of health were about honouring the agreements reached with the bma in november , february and may .
the £ 2-a-day drug that can cut heart attack threat
thousands of heart attack patients are to benefit from a £ 2-a-day drug , after officials recommended it be given to more people for longer .
anti-clotting drug ticagrelor slashes the risk of repeat attacks for people with heart disease .
the drug is already given for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of a stroke or another attack .
nhs watchdog nice has advised that it should be given to people for four years , to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
but now nhs watchdog nice has advised that it should be given to people for four years , to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
some 140,000 people have a heart attack in england every year , and a quarter of these go on to have another attack or a stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by the build-up of fatty material in artery walls to form a plaque .
if the plaque breaks apart it can cause a blood clot , blocking blood to the heart causing a heart attack .
and if the clot dislodges it can travel in the blood stream and block blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
people who have already have one attack are at a higher risk of having another .
ticagrelor , which is made by uk firm astrazeneca and sold under the trade name brilique , reduces this risk by making clots less likely .
the draft nice guidance , published today , recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months , followed by 60mg along with aspirin twice a day for another three years .
professor carole longson , director at the nice health technology evaluation centre , said : &quot; despite the availability of effective secondary prevention treatments , as many as a quarter of people who have had a heart attack go on to have another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences . &quot;
fear of a recurrence can have a significant negative impact on a person &apos;s quality of life .
the evidence shows that ticagrelor , in combination with aspirin , is effective at reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack .
in provisionally recommending ticagrelor we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who stand to benefit from it .
because information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - particularly the risk of bleeding - beyond three years is limited , the draft guidance does not recommend treatment with it beyond that period .
pc culture let vote fraud in muslim areas flourish
ex-tower hamlets mayor lutfur rahman was removed from office last year for corruption , prompting the government report
a culture of political correctness has led to a blind eye being turned to widespread voting fraud in muslim communities , a devastating government report reveals today .
ex-cabinet minister sir eric pickles lambasts the police , election watchdogs and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse because of &quot; over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion . &quot;
the former communities secretary , now the anti-corruption tsar , said the intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so bad that police should be allowed to put cordons outside polling stations to protect frightened voters .
he recommends that voters should have to take id to prove who they are when they vote .
currently , a voter merely has to state their name and address .
the report even suggests putting indelible ink on a person &apos;s fingers as they cast their ballot to prevent anyone being able to vote twice .
greater protection should be given to whistleblowers , sir eric says .
he calls for the press to be given greater access to council papers and decisions taken by unofficial committees or working groups .
&quot; this is not solely to protect against electoral fraud , but to protect local government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it , &quot; he said .
the report was ordered by downing street in the wake of the tower hamlets voting scandal in east london .
last year a special election court ruled the sitting mayor , lutfur rahman , should be removed from office following a litany of corrupt and illegal practices .
the court found rahman &quot; cynically perverted &quot; the religious feeling of his muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and islamophobia .
rahman , it was said , &quot; ran his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of faithful muslims to vote for him . &quot;
up to 300 votes were dubious or the result of personation , where a person votes while posing as someone else .
sir eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country .
he voiced particular alarm about postal voting fraud - in which senior members of the muslim community were said to have exerted pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choosing .
sir eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean up the voting system including bringing your id to prove who you are
his report says : &quot; evidence was presented of pressure being put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities , particularly women and young people , to vote according to the will of the elders , especially in communities of pakistani and bangladeshi background .
&quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions had turned a blind eye to such behaviour because of &quot; politically correct &quot; over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion . &quot;
sir eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including banning political activists from handling postal ballot papers to stop &quot; vote harvesting . &quot;
the report , being considered by theresa may , also calls for tougher checks on registration to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and benefit fraud .
consider the options for requiring voters to produce id before voting .
use indelible ink on a person &apos;s fingers once they cast their ballot to prevent anyone voting twice .
carry out systematic checks on a person &apos;s nationality to ensure they are eligible to vote .
put a three-year limit on requests for an automatic postal vote .
ban political campaigners and activists from handling completed postal votes and postal vote envelopes .
give police powers to set up cordons around polling stations .
change the law to make it easier to charge people with intimidation under the representation of the people act 1983 .
make it illegal to take pictures in polling stations .
make it a requirement that only english is to be used in polling stations ( except in wales ) .
strengthen training to ensure staff enforce the rule that voters go to the booth alone .
sir eric savages the metropolitan police , saying it is &quot; astonishing &quot; that no criminal charges were brought after the tower hamlets case .
&quot; the election court disqualified lutfur rahman and his agent for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; he said .
he was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - to a criminal standard of proof - on a series of grounds .
he also criticises the ineffectual &quot; tick-box inspections &quot; of town hall electoral registration departments .
sir eric said : &quot; last year &apos;s court ruling in tower hamlets was a wake-up call .
our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments , yet the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and state of denial by some bodies threatens that good reputation .
crazy for kate &apos;s cyclist lookalike and other celeb doppelgangers of rio olympians
fans of the rio 2016 olympics this week have gone wild for french cyclist pauline ferrand-prevot , who has proven an impressive lookalike for the duchess of cambridge .
but the 24-year-old olympian is far from the only athlete out fighting for gold this summer that boasts their own celebrity doppelganger - at least not according to social media .
so , in honor of the rio games and all the famous faces crossing our screens at the moment , femail have compiled a list of olympians who bear more than a passing resemblance with hollywood celebs .
the hunter and the wolf : u.s. men &apos;s archery team member brady ellison , left , has been compared to leonardo dicaprio since he was a kid
aside from kate &apos;s doppelganger on the cycling track , many people online have been quick to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of a-lister leonardo dicaprio .
u.s. men &apos;s archery team member brady ellison has caused a storm on twitter after images of him looking eerily similar to the wolf of wall street star surfaced .
and in fact , the archer became aware of the social media frenzy and admitted that he has been hearing that he looks like leo since he was a kid .
&apos;i personally don &apos;t see a huge resemblance , maybe besides the facial hair , &apos; brady told huffington post .
&apos;he is a good-looking dude so i guess it &apos;s a compliment . &apos; 
one of the most popular comparisons from london 2012 is undoubtedly going to be pointed out even more this year : the striking likeness between british long jumper greg rutherford and popular actor neil patrick harris .
russian gymnast aliya mustafina , with her large , expressive eyes , has been said to be a dead ringer for cuban-american singer gloria estefan .
and over in the pool , south african swimmer cameron van der burgh has been getting compared to glee star matthew morrison for years now .
changing it up : this user reckons that nathan is an &apos; athletic version &apos; of the inception actor
another long-running comparison has been between tennis star rafael nadal and actor josh hartnett who boast a similar heavy brow and lips .
silver medal swimmer russia &apos;s yulia efimova boasts more than just the same sunkissed skin and blonde hair as actress annalynne mccord , while team usa &apos;s nathan adrian has been said by fans to resemble an &apos; athletic version of joseph gorgon levitt . &apos; 
tough women : soccer star hope solo , left , and dexter actress jennifer carpenter , right , have similar face shapes and eyes
not the only one : one twitter user was very pleased that others also saw the similaritiest
floating a theory : according to this user , perhaps there is a reason behind the pair &apos;s similar looks
one twitter user took to the site recently to declare her happiness that &apos; the rest of the internet thinks that hope solo and jennifer carpenter are actually identical . &apos; 
indeed , the usa soccer star and the dexter actress share incredibly similar face shapes and eyes .
other popular comparisons have included kerri walsh-jennings and her smile that is near-identical to that of actress laura linney , as well as gold medal-winning gymnast gabby douglas , who boasts her own beautifully broad smile that matches that of bring it on star gabrielle union .

byron macdonald &apos;s analysis of 14-year-old ai yanhan &apos;s fourth place finish at the women &apos;s 4x200m freestyle relay outraged viewers of cbc &apos;s live olympic coverage on wednesday
canadian broadcaster cbc has been forced to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old female chinese swimmer &apos; went out like stink &apos; and &apos; died like a pig &apos; during a race .
commentator byron macdonald thought his mic was turned off when he started to dispense some of his own opinions at the end of the women &apos;s 4x200m freestyle relay final .
macdonald , who was brought on board cbc &apos;s commentary team to provide &apos; color &apos; could be heard saying : &apos; that little 14-year-old from china dropped the ball , baby &apos; .
too excited , went out like stink , died like a pig .
thanks for that .
chinese swimmer ai yanhan , 14 , swam the second leg of the relay in 1 : 57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than canada &apos;s taylor ruck , allowing the canadians to close the gap on china .
viewers across canada were quick to react online after being shocked by the tone and the language used
emmett macfarlane tweeted , &quot; did the cbc announcer just say the 14-year-old swimmer from china &apos; died like a pig &apos; &quot; ? ? ? ?
the idiot didn &apos;t realize they were still on the air . &apos; 
ai yanhan of china in the women &apos;s 4 x 200m freestyle relay final was described as : &apos; that little 14-year-old from china dropped the ball , baby . &apos; 
criticism on twitter came thick and fast against byron macdonald with many calling him out
twitter users did not hold back when the heard how insensitive byron macdonlad was being
another twitter user , sarah paradis , wrote : &apos; wow # byronmacdonald .
you represent the cbc and canada and make us all sound like a bunch of racists . # disgusted .

that said , they were inappropriate and an unfortunate choice of words and byron is very sorry for what he said .
on thursday afternoon , macdonald apologized on-air and attempted to qualify his remark by stating he didn &apos;t mean for it to be construed as a personal attack .
&apos;i would like to take a moment to apologize for a comment that i made last night after the women &apos;s relay , &apos; he said on cbc &apos;s olympic broadcast . &apos; 
&apos;i was referring to a swimmer &apos;s performance , and not to them as a person . &apos; 
&apos;needless to say , there was no disrespect intended and i &apos;m very sorry . &apos; 
primark shopper outraged at woman who brazenly tried on underwear in the middle of the shop
shoppers didn &apos;t know where to look when a woman stripped off to try on knickers on the shop floor in the middle of a primark .
to make it even worse , she sized up how she looked in them , peeled them off and put them back on the shelf .
she carried on browsing and eventually tried on four pairs of underwear at the store in bouverie place shopping centre , folkestone .
the primark store in bouverie place shopping centre , folkestone , where the woman tried on knickers before putting them back on the shelf
a mother-of-two , jenny davidson , who was in the shop at the time , said after trying on the underwear the mystery woman &apos; got dressed again and walked out of the store without buying anything . &apos; 
she said : &apos; people couldn &apos;t believe what they were seeing . &apos; 
standing in the middle of the shop floor , she took a pair of knickers from the display , stripped off her own tights and pants and put them on .
&apos;she didn &apos;t try to find anywhere discreet to do it - she just stood there , bold as brass . &apos; 
&apos;everyone was staring as she took the knickers off again and obviously didn &apos;t like them because she put them back on the shelf . &apos; 
she did the same with three more pairs before finally deciding there was nothing she liked and she got dressed again and walked out .
&apos;she didn &apos;t seem to care who was watching - or think about the person who would eventually buy the knickers she &apos;d been trying on . &apos; 
ms davidson , 33 , who lives in the kent town , said : &apos; how disgusting to think someone is going to take home knickers that another person has been wearing and they haven &apos;t been cleaned . &apos; 
the incident happened on tuesday afternoon .
ms davidson added : &apos; i gather the staff apparently tried to remove the garments from sale after she had left - which is just as well . &apos; 
&apos;i &apos;d hate to get home with a new pair of knickers and find another woman had put them on and taken them off again , and they hadn &apos;t been washed . &apos; 
a primark spokesman said : &apos; primark is aware of an incident which took place in our folkestone store on tuesday august 9 . &apos; 
all the product in question has been removed from sale .
how to defend yourself from gun attacks using krav maga
it &apos;s a dangerous world out there , but this video from dailymail.com might help make it a little safer for you .
we spoke to rhon mizrachi , new york-based grandmaster of the krav maga federation , to find out how to deal with gun-toting muggers at close range .
whether you &apos;re approached from in front or behind , this video will show you how to turn the tables on your mugger .
if approached from behind , mizrachi says , the first thing to do is turn around , so that you can see your attacker and &apos; clear the line of fire &apos; .
you then grasp the gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting them in the face with your free elbow .
a knee to the groin follows , and while the attacker doubles up in pain , you twist the gun from his hands , smack him in the face with the barrel and back up , keeping the weapon trained on him .
for gunmen approaching from the front , it &apos;s a similar technique - get your body out of the line of fire , grab the gun and twist it around so the villain can &apos;t fire .
at the same time , put weight on the gun and punch the attacker in the chest , then twist the gun from his grip before backing up and pointing it at him .
sounds tricky ?
check the video to see exactly how mizrachi does it .
but remember that the safest way out of any mugging - if you &apos;re not a krav maga grandmaster - is to hand over your cash .
traveller ian wright scrapes his tongue along europe &apos;s dirtiest places for travel guide
a british traveller has put his immune system and gag reflex to a serious test - by licking some of the dirtiest and disgusting places in europe .
presenter and travel writer ian wright , 51 , from suffolk , scraped his tongue along a euro note , a piccadilly circus hand rail , a train toilet &apos;s flush button and a russian public telephone to prove the strength of his immune system .
before licking each object , he used a luminometer to show himself , and us , just what he was getting in to .
but the experiment , which has be made into a film called the lickhiker &apos;s guide to inner strength , threw up some surprising results .
the thought of licking a train &apos;s flush button used by thousands of other may be utterly repellent , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
all the way along his trip through europe , mr wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about boosting gut bacteria and about his own health .
fortunately , nothing he licked left him with anything more than a bad taste in his mouth .
mr wright became known for testing the durability of his gut by travelling around the world and eating weird and wonderful things .
from public handrails in train stations to a toilet flush button the task definitely tested his immune system
in the movie made about it he said : &apos; ever since i was a kid i have been fairly carefree with my health and i &apos;ve put all sorts of things in my mouth from soil , eating worms and muddy water . &apos; 
he certainly proved his reputation during the film .
the only thing he turned down was a filthy russian public toilet .
his sample swab showed a luminometer count of over 4000 units .
by comparison , freshly washed hands should come in under 60 .
but there was one russian public toilet he refused to lick after his luminometer count was over 4000 units , when freshly washed hands are less than 60
mr wright and finnish dairy producer valio have produced the traveller &apos;s film called the lickhiker &apos;s guide to inner strength which shows the bacteria count in different place like in the bathroom
he said in the film : &apos; that is close to one of the worst things i have smelled in a toilet . &apos; 
there &apos;s nothing more dirty than that !
i &apos;m not going to lick anything because it &apos;s disgusting in there .
the lickhiker &apos;s guide to inner strength was produced in conjunction with finnish dairy producer valio .
the company provided mr wright with valio gefilus , which contain lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamins c and d to help boost people &apos;s gut bacteria and immune systems .
valio &apos;s senior vice president of snacks , juice and new categories niko vuorenmaa said : &apos; we really wanted to offer consumers something new .
something that would be fascinating to watch and at the same time explain the benefits of probiotics .
we did a lot of crazy brainstorming that ended in the idea &quot; let &apos;s call ian . &quot;
they claim the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of just talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it &apos;s linked to the immune system .
growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way .
i also think the film shows we have a great sense of humour !
tom hakala , who directed the film , added : &apos; let &apos;s put it this way - i would have lost my respect for ian if he had licked some of the things i asked him to , like the disgusting russian toilet that &apos;s shown in the film . &apos; 
naturally some things were easier to get ian to lick , some were pretty tough .
i &apos;m glad we got some of those dirty licks caught on tape . &apos; 
in a survey conducted in 2015 by valio , 84 per cent of the respondents associated lactic acid bacteria specifically with the well-being of the stomach and gut and 58 per cent said they use at least occasionally products containing added lactic acid bacteria .
family of yobs destroyed saltash , cornwall council house ahead of eviction
a family of yobs left their council house with £ 50,000 worth of damage after they were evicted for terrorising their neighbours .
tanya skeldon and her partner shaun trebilcock have been kicked out of the property in saltash , cornwall , after a long list of complaints against them .
after they were forcibly removed from the property , shocked housing associations officers found the property in a state of disrepair .
the walls were left with gaping holes , floorboards were ripped up , rubbish was strewn over the floor and graffiti was daubed on the walls .
the family have now been moved on and are believed to be living in a private accomodation
donna mcevoy , housing manager at cornwall housing , said she feared it might be beyond saving .
she said : &apos; it &apos;s been an absolute nightmare for people down here and i don &apos;t think people should have to live like that .
there are a lot of things to weigh up because this property will probably be known by the not-so-nice element of cornwall .
this family are notorious and their name is notorious .
the couple had three sons who lived at the property intermittently and police say the reign of terror the family inflicted included fighting in the street with baseball bats , intimidating nearby residents , drug use , drug dealing and excessive shouting , arguing and swearing .
skeldon , 47 , whose name was on the tenancy , was given an antisocial behaviour order in june .
old rubbish was found in a number of the rooms of the house , which may be demolished
floor boards had been pulled up in the property , from which drugs had been dealt in the past
neighbours say they were seen fighting in the street and police were regularly called
cornwall housing evicted her and her partner forcefully from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move on voluntarily .
the eviction was hailed by relieved neighbours who said their lives had been made a living hell .
one said : &apos; they didn &apos;t care about anybody . &apos; 
we lived next to them for 20 years and it &apos;s always been bad .
the amount of times we &apos;ve seen the police down here is unbelievable .
&apos;this morning , we couldn &apos;t sleep . &apos; 
we got up because it was so quiet here - we &apos;re not used to that !
it &apos;s going to be lovely now that they &apos;re finally gone .
adam fitzpatrick , cornwall housing &apos;s neighbourhood enforcement manager , said the family failed to cooperate with the local authority .
the family have lived in the house for 20 years , with police regularly called to the property
rubbish and old toys have been thrown down the overgrown side of the council house
he added : &apos; it is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for the behaviour of her and her family as eviction is always the last course of action that cornwall housing considers .
this was a very difficult case as the behaviour was extreme and their actions must have been terrifying for her neighbours to witness .
i appreciate all the work that has been put in by my team , devon and cornwall police and members of the community who bravely came forward to give us information .
i hope that this development will give some comfort to the neighbours and sends out a message that antisocial behaviour will not be tolerated .
mr fitzpatrick said that the three sons had all lived at the property at different times but said they were all in their 20s .
a dirty mattress left on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after the eviction
housing workers will now have to clear away the piles of rubbish which surround the house
in 2014 , police raided the property and found more than 70g in cannabis as well as scales , paraphernalia and £ 1,700 in cash .
skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of a class b drug with intent to supply .
she claimed the money was going towards a headstone for her son , lee skeldon , who died in a car crash in 2013 .
after being made homeless , it is understood that tanya and her partner are now living in private housing in plymouth .
the walls of many of the house &apos;s rooms had graffiti scrawled across them .
police say they will seek to evict tenants who flout the rules of their tenancies
angela crow , of devon and cornwall police , said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to flout the rules .
&apos;this sends out to those who feel that they can behave without recrimination , as well as those blighted by such behaviour , &apos; she said .
criminal and antisocial behaviour will never be tolerated by devon and cornwall police , who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in portugal are left terrified as a low-flying military jet flies skims beach
tourists sun worshipping in aveiro , portugal , had the shock of their lives
a portuguese air force p-3c orion plane swooped in incredibly low
the air force said it was on a training flight but insisted no risk to safety
this is the moment terrified tourists start to panic as a low-flying jet swooped down over a packed beach .
dramatic footage showed the military plane almost coming within touching distance of sunseekers on the stretch of sand in aveiro , northern portugal .
holidaymakers rose to their feet as they became understandably concerned about the noise from the jet engines without being able to see at first what was coming their way through the clouds .
the incident happened in costa nova near aveiro yesterday afternoon .
daniel fernandes , one of several holidaymakers who posted videos of the dramatic fly-by onto social media , said : &apos; it passed really low twice and there was a point when it looked like it was going to crash . &apos; 
nuno arroja added : &apos; i was surfing and swear it felt like the plane was going to fall on top of me . &apos; 
tourists on the beach at aveiro were terrified when the plane appeared out of the murk and flew at an incredibly low altitude
the portuguese air force said today the pilot of the p-3c orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to drop so low because it was the only way of checking them .
he said the jet had flown slightly lower than normal because of poor visibility caused by the smoke from nearby wildfires , but the air force insisted no-one &apos;s safety had been compromised .
wildfires have devastated parts of mainland portugal this summer as well as killing four people on the island of madeira .
the portuguese air force said today the pilot had to fly low because of the conditions - thick fog and smoke from wildfires - which obscured his visibility
the plane was on a training flight and the pilot was being asked to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
one-half of the funeral services is not complying with regulations .
one-half of funeral service providers do not comply with laws and regulations .
this is the result of checks carried out by the czech trade inspectorate ( cti ) in the second quarter ,
in which it established that one of their most common shortcomings is that they fail to inform relatives about their prices or do not issue a written confirmation of receipt of the order .
according to its spokesman , jiří fröhlich , cti imposed 41 fines totalling 73,000 czech crowns
on funeral services for this very reason .
inspectors discovered deficiencies in 47 of a total of 95 controls .
besides the failure to inform about prices and issue confirmations , some funeral services also sold products or provided services at prices that differed from those agreed .
in five cases , the products sold were not properly labelled and in one case an officially unverified measuring instrument was used .
as a result , the inspectorate banned the sale of 23 products for a total of 7077 czech crowns ,
including mainly urn containers , covers for candles and vases that were not properly labelled with mandatory information .
&quot; given that this is an area of services where laws and regulations are being breached on a regular basis , these checks will continue into the next quarter of the year , &quot; said fröhlich .
london schoolgirl who joined isil killed in syria
kadiza sultana , one of three british schoolgirls who left london last year to join isil , has reportedly died in syria .
attorney tasnime akunjee said her family learned of her death in raqqa , syria , a few weeks ago .
she was believed to have been killed by a russian air strike in raqqa , the group &apos;s stronghold in the country , itv news reported on thursday .
sultana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died just as she was making plans to flee the war-torn country and return to britain .
&quot; one would hope that the only benefit out of this is - as a tombstone and testament to others , that these are the risks actually involved in going to a war zone - to dissuade people from ever making that choice really , &quot; akunjee said .
in february 2015 , sultana and two other schoolgirls from east london boarded a flight to turkey and then a bus to the syrian border .
sultana &apos;s family was told she married an isil fighter in syria - and became a widow within months .
reid says clinton will stick with garland as supreme court nominee if elected
senate democratic leader harry reid says he is convinced that democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton will nominate judge merrick garland to the supreme court if she is elected president .
senate republicans have blocked garland &apos;s confirmation since president barack obama nominated him in march .
senate majority leader mitch mcconnell says the next president will choose the person to replace late supreme court justice antonin scalia .
reid said on a conference call thursday that he is predicting clinton will pick garland &quot; with some degree of credibility . &quot;
a spokeswoman for reid later said he had not spoken to clinton directly about whether she would nominate garland and was speculating .
he praised garland and said clinton &apos;s team would not want to &quot; rock the boat &quot; with a new pick .
garland is the chief judge for the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit .
reid said republicans who are blocking garland &apos;s nomination are &quot; minions &quot; and &quot; enablers &quot; of republican presidential candidate donald trump .
he said trump is unfit for office .
treats says nude calendar for &apos; women , as well as men&apos;
treats magazine is partnering with photographer david bellemere to launch a 1970s &apos; pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they &apos;re setting out to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 nu muses calendar .
treats president steve shaw told us earlier this year that his nude-heavy magazine differs from old-school playboys because &quot; playboy is for men . &quot;
i do this for women .
apparently he thinks the calendar is , too .
&quot; we need to get back to showcasing timeless and classic nudity where women , as well as men , feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body , &quot; shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar .
women will want to be a part of this project because it &apos;s a beautiful piece of art .
models can submit pics online or in person at open casting calls in los angeles and new york .
vinyl destination : who is actually buying records ?
lonely , middle-aged men love vinyl .
before you rush to litter the comments section with gnarly insults under the pseudonym notalllonelymiddleagedmen , this statement derives from actual data .
according to yougov , the much talked-about record resurgence is driven not by a boom in millennials who want to embrace the novelty of a physical item , but by midlife nostalgia .
those who have recently purchased a vinyl album are most likely to be aged between 45 and 54 , apparently .
in fact , those in the 18-24 age group are the least likely .
it is not just an act of hoarding by hobbyists , either - it has emotional significance : older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings to themselves ( 56 % versus 53 % ) and enjoy being alone ( 69 % versus 66 % ) .
but are yougov &apos;s results true ?
if this blog was a televised news report , the camera would follow me as i walked down the middle of a busy soho street , wearing a modest grey suit and gesturing wildly before stopping , cupping my hands and saying something authoritative like : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a look . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look .
while the heart of soho is slowly being drained of its charm and grot - hotels , eats , prets and paperchases now fill the buildings once occupied by independent sellers - a handful of fantastic specialist record shops still remain .
i &apos;d probably ask the camera to stop rolling for the next bit , in which i stand very close to various men in some of these stores and attempt to gauge their age and emotional disposition via observation .
glaswegian stuart , 55 , whom i follow from sister ray ( data count : two young women , three middle-aged men ) into reckless records ( data count : eight middle-aged men , one woman , probably in her 20s ) is in london for the afternoon for a meeting and is perusing the shops to fill a few hours .
is he a collector , i ask ?
&quot; i suppose i am , &quot; he says .
i have about 3,000 or 4,000 records .
these records , pictured above ( he emailed me the snap , i didn &apos;t follow him home ) , line his living room walls .
his reason for acquiring such a vast number of albums and singles is partly a result of his disposable income : he is now able to buy records he couldn &apos;t afford when they originally came out , and to repurchase items he sold when he was young and skint .
&quot; a lot of the stuff i get is late 60s , early 70s , things that came out when i was 11 or 12 , things i was probably a bit too young to get , &quot; he says .
he agrees that those who purchase records are more likely to be introverts who like their own company , adding : &quot; i don &apos;t smoke , i don &apos;t drink very much .
it &apos;s my vice .
wez , 25 , who works at sister ray , also believes that many of the customers he encounters fit the yougov profile .
he has , however , noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media hype , people who heard about the comeback and felt compelled to buy back their old records .
from conversations i &apos;ve had , people have got rid of their collection , normally around 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their vinyl to buy cds are now selling their cds to buy their records back , &quot; he says .
that may explain a boom in vinyl revivalists of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional importance of records ?
it takes a few seconds in a shop such as phonica to realise that record stores offer a comforting community of likeminded types .
according to wez , some older customers have taken umbrage with the contactless payment system in particular .
some vinyl fans may feel overwhelmed by the digital world and choose to retreat to the stability of the familiar record sleeve , of items that recall halcyon teenage memories .
&quot; i think sometimes it can be filling a void or having material possessions as some kind of comfort , &quot; wez says .
as a collector myself , i have that , and i think a lot of people do .
it &apos;s an easy way to occupy your headspace .
&quot; we &apos;re like their social workers ! &quot; pipes up a co-worker from a stack of records .
an icm poll in april revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a vinyl album the previous month had yet to listen to it .
the poll also found that 41 % have a turntable they never use , while 7 % of those who purchase vinyl don &apos;t own a record player .
at this stage of the news report , i would probably be looking gravely concerned while flicking through a stack of bossa nova compilations .
the &quot; trophy &quot; aspect of the revival is something that jonny , 42 , who works in sounds of the universe ( data count : three midde-aged men ) has noticed .
&quot; someone came in recently and said : &quot; i don &apos;t have a record player , but i want to buy a radiohead record so we can put it on our shelf , &quot; &quot; he says .
that &apos;s not a large percentage , but it &apos;s definitely happening .
more of the product side , less of the music .
we have people saying : &quot; i don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
that &apos;s younger people , not older ones , late teens who are just getting into it .
fopp , which now dedicates almost an entire floor to vinyl , has a far more varied audience when i arrive .
there are couples in their 70s , tourists taking photos , teenage boys and middle-aged women .
while the atmosphere is less at ease than the aforementioned stores - wild beast &apos;s latest synth- and sex-fuelled pop , rather than noodling jazz , is blasting from the speakers - it is good to see diversity in its customers .
none of them look particularly lonely , but nagging psychological trauma is hard to ascertain by standing next to someone for 30 seconds .
elanora , 27 , has been walking around fopp for a few minutes , looking at the variety of records on sale .
she is window-shopping , rather than on a spending spree .
she doesn &apos;t earn a lot , she says , so collecting records isn &apos;t really an option .
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music by a computer or another way , but the beauty of vinyl is ... &quot; she drifts off into a lovestruck sigh .
i don &apos;t know how to explain - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a shop said to have inspired a fresh generation of vinyl lovers : urban outfitters .
while giving the illusion of perusing the denim hot pants , i observe a group of teenage girls , who cluster around the polaroid cameras momentarily , before a dad and his daughter deliberate purchasing a crosley record player .
to the left is a stairwell , a wall of which is stacked with records by adele , jeff buckley , amy winehouse and fleetwood mac : a mix of contemporary and classics , the essential records for any average collection .
nobody is looking - perhaps because they are merely decoration , some so high up the wall that it would be impossible to touch them .
it is pure &quot; art vinyl . &quot;
but , given that any attraction to these items could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers into the depths of soho for more , there is little to complain about .
it is no surprise that a demographic more likely than most to have more time and money than most is also the one that spends the most on luxury items such as vinyl .
but while my findings suggest yougov &apos;s results are accurate , in soho record stores at least , they do not discount the huge number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in reality , in record shops and on online forums .
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
they are certainly not spending their thursday mornings loitering around the record shops of berwick street , flicking through records and avoiding the gaze of a creepy , 30-year-old fake television presenter who is looming over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men .

french court rejects bid to demolish shops at jungle refugee camp
a french court has rejected a bid by calais authorities to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the jungle camp where thousands of refugees are living .
at a court hearing this week , calais authorities had argued the state should be able to knock down a total of 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell goods , from cigarettes to energy drinks , offer haircuts , or sell tea for 50 cents ( 40p ) or basic meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants .
the calais prefect &apos;s office argued the places should be demolished because they represented a parallel economy that did not pay tax , and because they carried fire and sanitation risks .
humanitarian groups had told the court the shops and restaurants were vital , saying the free meals offered by a state-backed association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing numbers at the camp .
they argued the makeshift shops and restaurants often provided shelter and free meals to those in need .
a lille court ruled there was no legal basis for expelling the people running the 72 makeshift shops , but said the calais prefect &apos;s concerns &quot; were totally understandable . &quot;
the judge , jean-françois molla , said the groceries , cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than simply feeding people that &quot; live in extremely precarious conditions . &quot;
he said the spaces provided calm meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that had been under threat from demolition was the camp &apos;s jungle book kids &quot; cafe which is run not-for-profit and provides 200 meals a day , english and french classes , and asylum advice for the hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp .
more than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the kids &quot; cafe .
a letter sent to the guardian said its closure &quot; would be a catastrophe for these children , some of whom are as young as eight . &quot;
two charities , help refugees and l &apos;auberge des migrants , on friday estimated that numbers in the jungle camp have risen to over 9,000 people - the highest ever - after a steep increase in arrivals during the summer .
he thought he was going to die .
ulč resurrected himself and volleyball in Ústí .
&quot; since march , i was able to train normally , &quot; he said at the start of summer training having worked his way to full strength .
what was wrong with you ?
i had double pulmonary embolism and related heart problems .
when i competed at the universiade in korea , i had no idea that there was something wrong with my blood .
do you think this was caused by the long-haul flight to asia ?
i had a blood clot in my calf for two years , and i had no idea .
it did hurt but nobody found anything wrong with it .
then the clot moved upwards .
i have a damaged vein in my calf , which will continue to hurt , especially when it is worked or when the weather changes .
this does not present a limitation for me in any way - it is rather an aesthetic thing .
were you scared for your life ?
i was .
last year at a summer tournament in dřevěnice , i could not move at all , and i had no idea that i had a blood clot .
in the evening , i vomited blood .
the doctors were telling me it was something completely different , and i felt k.o. for another five days .
in dřevěnice , i really thought i was going to die . my girlfriend and my family also thought so .
i already started picturing myself somewhere else .
how did you deal with it ?
i guess i had to experience it ; it can only go upwards from here .
i know now that i have some problems with my blood , and i will have to watch it when i fly somewhere in the future .
on the other hand , i am not limited in any way .
just when i was ready to return to preparation in příbram last year , i started having problems with my heart .
everything is fine now .
to play again , i have been working on my fitness by my own at home since march .
fingers crossed , i feel physically in a better shape than i was before .
what do you expect from Ústí ?
i am excited - the team looks strong , and i know most of the guys .
i also look forward to meeting the two foreigners who will be joining the team .
i hope we will get on on a personal level , and we can work well together .
do you think you will be able to provide Ústí with a much needed boost ?
it had a reputation of being an underdog , but every season is different .
two years ago , brno was eighth , and now it finished second .
Ústí has a completely new team , only a few players remain .
it came in last in the extraliga , so there is plenty of room for improvement .
what we make of it is up to us .
we will see after the first rounds , who will be the underdog .
is the manager , mr brom a guarantee for success ?
he is very experienced and he has seen a lot , and he certainly wants to lift the team from the last place .
however , my arrival had nothing to do with his ; i agreed to join earlier .
there were other managers in the running , i am great friends with one of them and there was an agreement that he will join here .
i do not want to mention the name .
in the end , they hired mr brom and i am happy about the decision .
he has a great reputation , he manged some very good teams , his experience spans several decades and he was a successful player himself .
he will move us up in the rankings .
where do you come in ?
this team will fight , which is also my forte .
i enjoy fighting , encouraging others to give their best , and i am looking forward to the challenge of playing in a team which does not belong to the very top .
i played for příbram for two years , but Ústí is a much bigger challenge than to play for the sixth team because here we have to start from the bottom .
you mentioned foreigners , the australian player boehm is already training with Ústí .
what does he look like ?
as it happens , i know him because we played against each other in the group at the universiade .
we spoke to each other there a couple of times , and we also hung out together after matches , so we had a chance to get to know each other .
we beat them 3 : 1 , i reminded him right at the beginning of summer preparation in Ústí .
he has a slovak girlfriend , he is a nice guy .
the american nadazdin and the brazilian ze are also expected to join .
do you know anything about them ?
i wrote to the american , he seems to be a nice guy . i have no idea , whether the brazilian guy can speak english .
you got in touch with the american ?
i thought it was a good idea .
i am a setter , which means my role is to create opportunities , so i should be communicating with everyone .
i did some research on the internet to see what kind of player he is , and i saw some videos .
he seemed pretty good - he is tall and jumps a lot .
we exchanged a couple of messages on facebook , he is a bit of a comedian , i think he will fit in well with the team .
how are you looking forward to being the number one setter ?
i would not have accepted anything else .
after all , i will be twenty-four soon and i don &apos;t like being a substitute .
i prefer to be at the centre of things , leading the team rather than let somebody else lead .
i guess i would not want to go on playing full-time if i were to be the second setter . if you cannot give your best , it is not worth much .
how often have you been the first setter ?
six months in příbram , when kust , the captain was not in form , got injured , then there were problems with money and he left .
since then , we climbed up the rankings and i played all the time .
in brno , where i started , i alternated between first and second setter .
i had a great year at staré město , and i could choose from a range of offers and i decided to go for příbram .
while there , budějovice has shown interest in me , i decided to stay , but i could not finish the season because of the embolism episode .
this is a new beginning .
gold medal no 22
the short individual medley remains phelps &apos; domain .
&quot; it is great to be able to get back on the podium and to hear the national anthem , it feels amazing , &quot; smiled phelps while his eyes welled up with tears .
his mother together with his fiancée cheered him on , while his son boomer slept peacefully sporting a pair of ear defenders .
i am experiencing an incredible week at the end of my career .
it is crazy - i started swimming competitively twenty years ago and in a few hours it will be all over , he said emotively .
silver was won by janpan &apos;s kosuke hagino , who won the long individual medley .
china &apos;s wang shun won the bronze , having won bronze in this event at last year &apos;s world championships .
following in the footsteps of alu oerter ( discus throw ) and carl lewis ( long jump ) , michael phelps becomes the third athlete in olympic history to win four consecutive individual titles in the same event .
brazil &apos;s thiago pereira and his compatriot , ryan lochte kept pace with lochte for most of the race ,
but neither man could live with him on the freestyle leg of the race as they dropped out of the medals completely .
the american superhero will have at least one more chance to expand his historic medal collection .
shortly after the medal presentation ceremony for the individual medley he advanced into the 100m butterfly final .
phelps &apos; historic achievement could not be overshadowed even by his compatriot ryan murphy , who won the 100m and 200m backstroke titles in rio .
in the final , he took gold over mitch larkin of australia , who finished 0.37 seconds behind him and russia &apos;s evgeny rylov , who came in third .
while murphy only finished fifth in 200m backstroke at last year &apos;s world championships , he became the undisputed backstroke king at the rio olympics .
he unseated mitch larkin from the throne , who won a similar double at last year &apos;s world championship .
this is the first time he won a gold medal at the olympic games .
american simone manuel and canada &apos;s penny oleksiak claimed joint gold in the women &apos;s 100m freestyle final .
while for the sixteen-year-old penny oleksiak , it was the fourth medal at these games , for simon manuel , it was the second medal after having earned silver in the relay .
manuel became the first black female swimmer to win an olympic gold medal .
i hope i can inspire other people to realise they can do this too .
i dedicate this medal to all those who will follow in my footsteps loving this sport , said the visibly moved manuel .
third was sweden &apos;s sarah sjöström , who also won gold in 100m butterfly in a world record time and silver in 200m freestyle .
the world record holder , australia &apos;s cate cambell only finished sixth .
japan &apos;s rie kaneto won the women &apos;s 200m breaststroke . it is the first olympic medal for the twenty seven-year-old .
her best result so far was a fourth place in this event at the 2013 world championships .
this was the second silver medal for russia &apos;s yulia efimova , who faced hostility from her fellow competitors and the crowd because of her doping past .
i have made one big mistake .
i won my appeal and i do not see why i have to keep answering these questions all the time .
i feel very tired , said the russian swimmer .
she had to appeal to the court of arbitration for sport ( cas ) to compete at the rio games .
they have considered my appeal , and i have won .
if somebody disagrees or has a different opinion , i suggest they contact cas directly , she added .
this is disappointing , we could have won .
and a start at midnight ?
something unheard of .
it was a strange day for the czechs .
they only found out less than an hour before the match who they will be playing against .
they had to master the tactical preparation at a lighting speed .
and then , in an unusual time , the match started on the small court number 1 .
after a dismal start to the first set , they closed on their opponents only to fail to bring the set home at 19 : 19 .
in the second , they clearly improved and levelled , but lost the decisive tiebreaker .
the 10 : 15 defeat was mainly down to a number of poor serves and meant the pair crashed out of the olympic tournament .
&quot; we could have beaten the russians , &quot; hermannová said .
what is your view of the match ?
i had a slow start , but then we managed to get into the match and play really well .
at the end , my usually reliable return deserted me .
we lost that set , which was crucial .
we started the next set well with a changed defence strategy , we served well and dominated the court .
in the tiebreaker , there were too many poor serves , which tipped the scales to our detriment .
it was disappointing because we could have beaten the russians .
shame about the dismal start to the first set .
we were able to close on , but we lost the crucial points .
the second set was great and the third was decided by serves .
we made too many mistakes .
we gifted them five points and these five points would have made the difference . this was crucial .
it is a shame , because the match with the russians was winnable .
how did you like playing on the small court number 1 ?
it was reminiscent of playing on side courts in china ,
but the setting and atmosphere were different .
it took place at one in the morning in dead silence . there was no music , no nothing .
this was quite a change compared with the centre court .
we would have not chosen this deliberately , but it was not down to us .
how did you prepare for the match , having found out the names of your opponents one hour before the match ?
it was strange .
we started to warm up for the match not knowing who we will be playing against . as a result , we could not prepare tactically for the match in contrast to the other teams .
but simon ( their coach simon nausch ) prepared us tactically for nearly every eventuality .
he had prepared a lot of papers with tactics , so we were pretty well prepared in this respect .
do you recall ever having to start a match at midnight ?
i don &apos;t think so .
we played at half past ten , but not at midnight .

was it unpleasant ?
given that our last two matches in the group started at ten , we have already adjusted our routine to this later start .
this was still about two hours later .
it is strange , but i cannot think of any other sport where athletes are required to give their best at midnight .
on the other hand , i think we prepared as well as we could .
we knew about it , but it is not common and probably and it will hardly become my favourite time to play .
how do you rate your olympic experience ?
as our goal was to advance from the group , we can say
that we have achieved that ,
but now , after the match i am sad .
i &apos;ll sleep on it and from tomorrow , i will only remember the positive aspects of the olympic tournament .
big brother is here in the form of the first spying sim .
there is no escape .
the new rules should apply to all persons without a thai passport who decide to purchase a sim card from one of the local operators .
this does not only include tourists but also individuals with long-term visas who e.g. work in thailand or who got married there .
according to the secretary-general of the national broadcasting and telecommunications commission , takorn tantasith there will be no exceptions .
the thai national telecoms regulator presented the plan to sell sim cards specifically designed for foreigners in early august .
the authorities intend to implement the new measures , which will allow them to track their location within six months .
according to mr tantasitha , this is aimed at protecting national security , as it will help authorities to solve crimes perpetrated by foreign nationals .
in addition , these so-called tourist sim cards should also help to uncover individuals who exceed their length of stay without proper authorisation .
retailers should start selling the new sim cards for foreigners along sims for locals within six months .
the principal difference between them is in the tracking function which will be permanently enabled on sim cards sold exclusively to individuals without a thai passport .
it will not be possible to disable this function .
&quot; we do not need this feature for sim cards sold to thais because we can always easily track them , &quot; added tantasith .
it should be noted that in thailand , prepaid cards are not anonymous as it is the case in the czech republic .
the seller requires a proof of identity .
on the other hand , one of the operators used to supply tourists with free starter sims at airports .
these were completely anonymous .
other asian countries , including malaysia and singapore , are also mulling to follow the thai example and introduce similar measures .
while the sim registration is compulsory , under current legislation , they are not free to track foreigners .
the planned measures do not mean , however , that foreigners are under any obligation to purchase sim from a local operator upon arrival to the country .
they are free to use the roaming services offered by their existing sim cards and escape the watchful eye of the thai authorities .
this is because the operators in the destination country only know the relevant network information . once a sim connects to the network ,
they know the telephone number , but not the owner information .
given that the roaming charges are so much higher than the tariffs of local operators , it is highly likely that most tourists will eventually cave in and buy a local sim .
the authorities &apos; efforts to track the movements of foreigners , have been the subject of sharp criticism by expat groups living in thailand .
tantasith has tried to calm the situation with respect to privacy protection by comparing this with the obligation to provide information about the residential address in immigration documents .
police will need to get a court order if they wanted to track the movements of a concrete individual .
any abuse of the system will lead to a yet unspecified punishment .
&quot; it would be a criminal offence for a service provider to track the sim location without a court order , &quot; added tantasith .
in addition , the system should also maximize the use of prepaid cards .
while at present , telephone numbers are only recycled 90 days after the sim has last connected to the network , this could be now reduced to fifteen days after departure from thailand .
luxury flat in a new development in vinohrady has a swimming pool and hot tub on the terrace .
why did you opt for a flat in a new development ?
we were looking for a worry-free flat with a property manager looking after the property .
among our must-have features was ample parking and a lift , which basically ruled out older buildings .
not to mention the problematic acoustics in old houses , rocking floors , high energy consumption , etc .
we also wanted a large terrace , which older buildings do not tend to have .
you will find more about other interesting properties we visited in the magazine &quot; moderní byt &quot; &#91; modern flat &#93; .
the entire interior was designed by the architect lenka langerová and her colleague kamila polaková from the interior design studio artigo .
why did not choose them ?
would you recommend this approach to everyone ?
we would recommend using the services of an architect to anyone who is designing a flat from the scratch , because it is a very complex technical process .
the second level is the actual interior design : designers have a much better idea about the range of available materials , and they are able to make it all work based on the wishes of the client .
we have already worked with lenka langerová on our flat in the mountains based on a recommendation from another client and because everything worked well we decided to approach her to work on the reconstruction of our new flat in vinohrady .
what were your practical and aesthetic requirements ?
we wanted a generous entertaining-living space with adequate facilities for a family of four , conceived as a modern yet not impersonal interior .
the priority was to create a visual and functional link between the flat and the terraces and to implement smart home features .
not least it was also important to safeguard the quality of execution .
did you leave everything to the experts or did you have a say in the final look of the interior ?
we approved all designs including technical drawings but the designs were always created by the architects .
at the beginning , we specified what we expect from design , and we have shown the architects some elements , such as carpets or paintings which we wanted to see integrated into the design .
i think that our collection of mostly czech paintings , including the works by karel malich , karel vysušil , václav Špála or otto gutfreund helped the architects to get a feel for our taste .
the combination of black , white and nutwood was the brainchild of the architect as well as individual pieces of furniture , walls , flooring , lighting , carpets , fabrics , art , etc . we then used visualisations to make sure everything worked well together . the combination of black , white and nutwood was the brainchild of the architect as well as individual pieces of furniture , walls , flooring , lighting , carpets , fabrics , art , etc . we then used visualisations to make sure everything worked well together .
did you encounter any complications during the realisation phase , which forced you to abandon some of the original ideas or come up with new ones ?
perhaps only at the beginning of the project , when we arrived at the construction site and were able for the first time to get to our floor only to find out that the views we envisaged will be blocked by surrounding buildings .
this forced us to change the layout plans literally overnight .
you have used granite on kitchen countertops and fireplace tiling .
the interior is dominated by wood surfaces complemented by leather used e.g. on dining chairs and bar stools norma from arper .
how would you characterise the interior ?
are you planning any changes or is there something you wish you would have done differently ?
i think it is a modern , airy interior , which serves its purpose .
we do not plan any changes ; most changes took place after we moved in in the form of shielding and fitting solutions for the terraces .
perhaps the only complaint concerns the nutwood flooring which is too susceptible to damage in a household with a dog .
comments by the architects , ing. arch . lenka langerová and mga . kamila hornychová , who implemented the project
the flat is on the top floor of a new development , which made it possible to come up with a completely new layout and several other modifications .
an important element of the interior was the use of daylighting systems in the ceiling of the hall and the master wc ,
to channel natural light to the darker areas of the flat .
direct access from the master bathroom to the roof terrace and the swimming pool from usspa is one of the adjustments , which was very beneficial for the functionality of the apartment as a whole .
it also includes a swimming pool and a hot tub .
you are not as negative as the french , says a muslim living in prague .
you are from france .
where have you lived before you moved to prague ?
my parents are originally from algeria .
i was born in the south of france , near the spanish border .
so i moved around quite a bit .
i lived in toulouse , lyon and marseille .
in france , i studied journalism , thanks to which i managed to get a job with a magazine .
why did you then decide to move in another country ?
i started to feel suffocated in france .
i just did not want to live there anymore .
mainly because of the atmosphere between people .
the french people came across as overly negative .
people in france are generally quite negative , but it has become much worse lately .
it is interesting that you mention negativity .
there are many people you say this about the czechs .
believe me , you are not as negative as the french .
some people who come to france as tourists , for example , may not be so aware of it .
but i had enough .
everybody keeps talking about money , for example .
people feel that they do not have enough money , despite the fact that the minimum wage in france is eur 1,500 , which in my view is quite a lot .
now there is another problem with behaviour towards muslims ,
which is beyond me .
for example , in the street where i lived , my non-muslim neighbour started to look down on me just because i am a muslim .
as if i was some kind of evil .
as a result , i no longer felt welcome in france ,
even though the rest of my family stayed there .
so you decided to move to another country .
why did you choose the czech republic ?
i was looking for a job in a different country , and i found an opening at air france here in prague .
i admit that i did not know anything about prague at the beginning .
i knew something about the czech republic as my dad told me about what happened in czechoslovakia , but i did not know what to expect from prague .
i have now been living here for three years , and i cannot imagine living anywhere else .
was it a big difference when you moved from france to prague ?
mainly because of the different atmosphere .
maybe it is because i do not speak czech , so i cannot catch some of the negative reactions or insults , but i feel that people have more freedom here .
i feel i can do anything , dress in any way i like , and nobody will judge me .
in france , people keep starring at you in an unpleasant way because you dress differently , etc .
in prague , i began to feel really free .
in my opinion , locals do not seem to care much about these things .
where do you work now ?
after i left air france , i worked for a while for a travel website .
after that i founded a website together with a friend , which can be used by people to find and offer shared accommodation .
we currently only operate in prague but we would like to expand to cover the whole of central europe .
do you have any czech friends in prague ?
i have two very close friends , who are half czech , and two female friends who are czech .
i must say that czechs tend to keep their distance at first .
they do not let just anyone get too close ,
which is quite different where i grew up .
in the south , everybody is hugging and kissing each other on the cheek .
it is different here , but i understand that this is a cultural thing , so i try to adjust .
you mentioned that you do not speak czech .
does the language barrier present a problem for you ?
quite the contrary , i find it is really easy here in prague because virtually everyone speaks english here .
even in convenience stores and supermarkets .
i would like to learn czech , but i do not have time
and because it is relatively easy to communicate in english , i do not have the incentive to learn the language quickly .
every time when i have a problem , somebody comes along who can help me .
did you come across some negative reactions ?
maybe because you are a muslim ?
by and large , i did not .
maybe it is also because i work in an international environment which is more tolerant .
i can think of one experience though .
my supervisor , wo was czech , once told me about the french football team and said something along the lines of :
while i found that comment a bit offensive ,
i never had anybody having a problem with me because of me being a muslim .
a colleague once warned me , however , about anti-muslim demonstrations .
he told me to avoid the city centre because they would only be hurling insults at me .
anti-muslim demonstrations are partly related to terrorist attacks .
what do you think about the current situation ?
are you afraid that something similar to paris , nice or brussels could happen here in prague ?
i feel safe in prague .
the problem is that nowadays anything can happen anywhere .
until recently , i could not imagine that something like that could happen in france .
and this does not only concern muslims .
what is more , islam does not condone violence at all .
in my view , people who kill other people are not muslims .
according to the quran , no human can kill another human . only god can kill .
what do you think about terrorists using your faith to justify their actions ?
it is tough .
i feel shame and guilt , even though i should not feel like that at all .
i try not to follow the news about violence too much but every time i read something , i feel the need to apologise for something that is really not my fault .
i am a completely different person , so why should i apologize for the terrorists ?
we met on náměstí jiřího z poděbrad .
on wednesday , czech muslims , along with christians demonstrated here against violence .
did you know about it ?
no , i was not aware of it .
but i understand why people feel the need to show that they are against violence .
i do not think that they have to do something like this .
why should they feel guilty for something they did not cause ?
do you come across other muslims in prague ?
my colleagues are , for example , from egypt and other muslim countries .
they tend to be a bit more religious than i am , so we sometimes have fierce discussions about islam , because we see islam quite differently .
i come from france , so i went through a different education system , whereas they have been taught islam in school .
we have different attitudes , but we have respect for one another .
people sometimes associate islam with the subordinate position of women .
what do you think about it ?
i definitely do not feel subordinate .
quite the contrary .
i am a woman and i am strong .
does it have anything to do with the fact that you do not cover your head
and wear a hijab for example ?
it has something to do with how i was raised .
my mother , for example , is a devoted muslim .
she prays five times a day , but she does not wear a headscarf .
i was always taught that faith is a purely personal matter .
it depends on how one interprets it .
when you read the quran , you should make up your own mind .
when i read a passage in the quran which says that god told the prophet to hide his wives from the eyes of the others , i said to myself ,
on the other hand , i would wear headscarf if i travelled to iran or saudi arabia , where headscarves are mandatory .
do you plan to stay in prague ?
so far , yes .
i have never felt so good anywhere else .
i thought for a while about poland , but i feel great in prague .
i could even imagine raising my children here .
in my view , prague is an ideal city .
czech muslims , along with christians demonstrated against violence .
the wind in rio swept the yachtswoman kozelská-fenclová closer to the final .
the czech sailor , veronika kozelská-fenclová did well in friday &apos;s two heats on the race course in rio di janiero .
in the laser radial class , she moved to the tenth place before the final two heats .
this would guarantee the czech yachtswoman a place in the final .
you can collect parcels like pokémon .
they want to compete with delivery services .
the brains behind the idea to use already scheduled journeys to transport packages are the tv director matěj liška and marek greger , a manager of a music club in prague .
they used the idea to create three apps with different geographical reach .
we have launched the domestic delivery services app &quot; převezu &quot; in may .
at this point , it contains one thousand cities , and we will continue to expand the network .
we want to learn the business in the czech republic first before we start focusing more on other countries , said the forty one-year-old manager in an interview with idnes.cz .
how does the app &quot; převezu &quot; work and who can benefit from it ?
you can download the app for free and register .
then you can enter your route and information about the size of the package you can transport and the price .
on the same day , someone else may be looking to deliver something .
if both sides agree on the route and the time of delivery , the app matches them together and they both receive a notification ,
next a chat window opens , where the two sides can arrange the handover / pick up .
how many people do you think will have to register to match every package with a courier ?
i am not in the position to estimate how many registered users and journeys there have to be to balance supply and demand to ensure optimal coverage .
it is already working well on the main routes but this is much easier than it would be , say , on the road between villages .
the more people , the bigger the potential to offer a fast and accurate delivery ,
it takes time for people to trust the system as they realise that nobody will run away with their parcel .
have you not dealt with such a case yet ?
how many users does the service have two months after launch ?
we currently have roughly five to six thousand people who deliver parcels .
we consider this to be a success and believe that it will snowball from here .
is there not a risk that the sender may have to wait too long ?
we hope to be competitive with the large conglomerates not least because we are able to deliver the package the same day and for a fraction of the price .
large companies charge several thousand czech crowns for delivery within two hours .
with us , you pay one hundred czech crowns or less because someone is going to your destination anyway .
should traditional carriers worry about potentially losing customers in the future ?
we hope that this will be the case .
the market has a huge potential , there is a range of multinational carriers operating here , making money . when the large retail chains first came here , everybody rushed to shop there only to find out later that the quality does not necessarily reflect the price they are paying for the products .
nobody likes to find a note in their mailbox advising them to pick up their parcel at the post office branch after 19 : 00 ,
when you needed the parcel six hours ago and waited at home because it was important .
we want better , faster and more customer-friendly service that will not annoy people and will send a signal to the competition to try harder .
marek greger ( 41 ) and matěj liška ( 39 ) .
neither ever worked in the field of information technology .
marek greger works as a music club manager , matěj liška is a tv director .
in 2014 , they started to prepare the application shippansee ltd , which uses previously scheduled routes between world capitals , in particular , by air to transport packages .
in 2015 , they hired a company to work on the project , which created apps , e.g. for mall.cz , jobs.cz or Čsfd .
it took 9 months to develop the app , and they launched to the market in march 2016 .
the development of the &quot; převezu &quot; app started in december last year , and it was released in may this year .
it is a localised version of the shippansee app adapted to the czech market .
they have been developing the apps &quot; mesíkem &quot; and &quot; mesíkem profi &quot; since january this year and made them available to users at the end of july 2016 .
they intended from the very start to merge all these apps into one .
they want to fine-tune the app in the czech republic and then focus on the global market in cooperation with a strong investor .
sharing economy has become a buzzword lately , with airbnb and uber being the leading companies advancing this type of service .
are you not concerned that the boundary between sharing and grey economy is blurred in this particular field ?
it is the same thing , just a different product .
we are aware that if we succeed as a business , and we continue to grow we will be criticised for being part of the grey economy .
while our service will help people to make money on the one hand and save money on the other , it is not our intention to evade the tax authorities or tax inspections .
any user , who makes money , will be advised about the need to pay taxes on the income generated .
what does make you believe that this service has such a big potential ?
the sender will save money and the courier will lower the cost of his journey .
this is the powerful idea that connects the two sides .
in the age of social networks that divide people , we would like to bring people together .
people will be happy that they could help someone , and they will be able to share stories with others .
maybe someone will bring you your misplaced glasses , keys or medication .
in my view , people miss the personal touch . we say about this app that it is a service by the people for the people .
how can you guarantee that the courier will not take the parcel and run away ?
upon registering , each user will be required to submit a scan of his or her id card and provide bank , credit or debit card details .
these are channels that lend credibility to the service and its users .
couriers also collect stars based on the sender reviews .
we will also be offering insurance , the details of which are currently being fine-tuned .
if the consignment is uninsured , the courier is liable for its loss or damage . however , he is not liable for its content under the criminal law , if he was unaware that there was something illegal inside the package .
if the courier is stopped by the police who searches the trunk of his car and finds an ak-47 or ten kilos of hashish in the closed package , the sender will be criminally liable .
is there not a risk that the sensitive data from the database could be misused ?
if necessary , those registered can be traced by the administrative authority , which alone will be able to access it ; even we will not have access to the data , which are protected from misuse .
how much can couriers earn after they have successfully delivered the package ?
couriers set their prices , and they receive the full amount they ask for .
the sender will be charged a few percentage points extra for arranging the contact between the two sides .
this represents our profit , but it is only a few percentage points because we want to increase the volume .
it is also not possible to claim that the courier has not delivered a package when this is not the case ; the handover and deliver is verified using qr codes .
are there any restrictions
as regards the size or content of the parcel ?
you can transport anything .
we have three sizes - the smallest is about butter size , the medium is like a tray of eggs and the large is the size of a crate of beer .
there are no other restrictions and if someone has sufficient room in their car , they may transport a fridge .
the sender also has the option to take a picture of the parcel through the app , so that the courier can see what the job in hand is .
senders are not even required to package the item , if they do not wish to hide the package content .
all you have to do is hand the forgotten sweatshirt to the courier .
whose idea was it and how long did it take to launch the service ?
a friend came up with the idea more than two years ago , and i did not pay much attention to it back then .
then he showed me a demo of the app with multinational scope that was mainly aimed at airline passengers .
i told him that i would not be looking for an investor , because i wanted to invest my own savings into the project .
we spent the next year developing the app , so we decided to establish shippansee ltd in london to enhance the credibility of the whole product .
nevertheless , this is not an area you are now focusing on as a matter of priority .
no , we focus our marketing effort on the czech republic , where we are trying to fine-tune the app to eliminate any bugs and there are still areas we want to improve .
we want to respond to the feedback from our customers , and we are not that focused on foreign markets at present .
we know we are in this for the long haul , and we are not trying to rush things through as we want to create a really good product for the people .
shippansee ltd was the first and the most expensive app ; the other two were in a way just an upgrade .
&quot; převezu &quot; was created when we decided that the national segment can potentially be much more interesting and if nothing else we will use our experience in the czech republic to learn .
the third app , &quot; mesíkem &quot; is a local app for cities .
nevertheless , you can use it to send a parcel to an address on the other side of the world .
it works for the sender the same way as &quot; převezu &quot; , the difference being that as a courier , you see the consignments as dots on the map which are the closest to you thanks to gps on their mobile phone .
&quot; mesíkem profi &quot; is an app for couriers who want to pursue this professionally .
does this mean that people can literally pick up parcels around the town as their second job ?
absolutely , in prague , this app could be downloaded by taxi drivers , students , mothers on maternity leave or anyone who wants to make some cash on their way to work .
they could , in essence , collect it like they do collect pokémons these days .
the courier can see where there are jobs available , he or she can click on it and find out when the package is due for delivery , and then goes ahead and delivers the package .
we designed the service to be much cheaper than the competition .
we are currently working on a web interface , which will be crucial for companies to send packages ; they will be able to fill in the information online and create the dots on the map .
we will then be in the position to invoice them , e.g. every month for using the service .
do you now devote all your time to the project ?
it keeps us very busy , and we still have our day jobs to be able to fund and develop the project .
we do not have a multinational investor with deep pockets backing us . we are two regular guys - one who had a great idea and another who jumped on the bandwagon with additional suggestions and ideas .
we are now looking for a dedicated and resourceful investor who would have the courage to develop the product beyond the czech market and to create a global market leader comparable with airbnb and uber .
the story-scope of titanfall 2 is expected to deliver nearly forgotten diversity .
according to the information provided , the sequel and the single player campaign are expected to be much more diverse than the call of duty .
the length will be around the standard eight hours , and the content is based on the concept of net battles introduced by its predecessor .
players can enjoy the freedom of movement , which next to running includes the option to use a fighting titan .
in addition to the action passages , the game contains levels focused on flexibility in movement .
they are reminiscent of platform games and puzzles .
to clear them , it is key to utilise , e.g. double jumps , wall runs and rope sliding .
in addition , players will have to do damage to their enemies .
there will also be maps reminiscent of mazes and levels with special concepts .
in one of them , it will be , for example , possible to move platforms up and down and open massive doors ,
and thus change the look of the battlefield .
the pace of the gameplay should , therefore , move between fierce action and quieter moments to explore the unknown planet .
players will be in control of a foot soldier jack cooper , who is dreaming about becoming a professional pilot .
at the start of the campaign , cooper and captain lastimosa crash on an alien planet typhon , which is inhabited by enemy troops .
the local wildlife will also not give them a break .
what is more , lastimosa is fatally wounded in the crash and cooper , therefore , has to revive the captain &apos;s titan .
his dream of becoming a pilot comes true earlier than he thought .
the first step will be to steal the battery necessary to repair the robot .
important will also be the conversations cooper has with the titan .
these will serve as a source of information for the players to find out about the soldier &apos;s past , while at the same time , the impersonal communication style of the robot will produce some laughs .
for example , when the titan dryly lists all the injuries that cooper could suffer as a result of a planned jump .
the polygon server was first to report on the titanfall 2 campaign .
we will be able to judge the game for ourselves in two months , and we at bonusweb will be reporting on our first impressions of the game .
titanfall 2 will be released on 28 october for pc , playstation 4 and xbox one .
thq brand will be resurrected but the original publishing house is dead .
the swedish company nordic is changing its name to nordic thq .
following the collapse of the publishing house thq , it acquired a number of its brands and the right to use the company name and logo .
as a result , nordic was able to release e.g. darksiders 2 deathnitive edition or the red faction collection .
there are another 23 games being created for the publishing house , which is yet to reveal 13 of them .
thirty years ago , at a time when i was about to retire , my wife of thirty years started an affair with our neighbour , who was twenty years her junior .
i knew about it from the start - she was first pursuing him quite openly before they got together .
he was quite a big guy , probably her type as she dated a similar type before me .
she was head over heels in love with him .
in those first days , her voice even changed ; she suddenly had such a girly , infatuated voice .
however , when i told her that i knew what was going on she denied it .
i was watching the whole thing .
he used to arrive at home from work at half past three and she always left at three to go shopping .
she tried to see him at least once every day .
later , i figured out that they were meeting in the house where he lived , in the laundry room .
there were many times i knew that they were at that very moment .
i managed to get the keys and i was determined to catch them there inflagranti .
i do not know why , but in the end , i always stayed at home .
i was incapable of taking the decisive step and going there .
you may find if funny , but i am convinced that my wife was controlling me with her mind .
i think that she found out early on that she can control me to make me do what she wanted .
and i actually did it .
maybe i am just a looser .
at the same time , my other neighbours also hinted that they knew about the affair .
i was a fool because i never asked them what i should do .
i was scared that if push came to shove , things would get really bad .
only my daughter thought that this may have an impact on everyone in the family .
as the time passed , i kept procrastinating .
once i went to see him in his flat , and i told him that i needed help with something in the laundry room .
he went there with me , and i told him that i received an anonymous letter accusing him of having an affair with my wife , and that i was inclined to believe it .
i asked him what he had to say .
he stood there , shrugged and said nothing .
at the time , i also bumped into his wife on her way from the shops .
i told her about it , but she did not believe it .
she did not react and did not say anything .
nobody said anything to me at the time .
i am a type of person who does not go out much , and i always found it difficult to meet new people , let alone women .
hence , i was not really contemplating a divorce .
i still hoped that it would end one day .
i told myself that i would forgive her everything and life would go on .
this is not how it went down ,
and i have never really come to terms with it .
i am still keeping those feelings inside .
i used to show her how i felt , but in the end , i stopped to keep the peace .
he still lives next door , and i still live with her ,
the only difference being that she is more of a housekeeper than my wife .
she always did everything at home - she did the cooking , washing , cleaning up .
she has always been a hard worker .
i think she wanted to make sure that i do not have another reason to complain .
i can also say that she is kind .
sometimes i would like to touch and hug her but she would not let me .
we keep going together for walks and shopping , and everyone thinks we have a happy marriage .
she said to me once that she never loved me .
she said that she always had been fond of me , but she never loved me .
i can see that she still loves him , she worships him like a god .
i am tired of such a life .
back when it all started , and i was taking it very badly , i once said to her that i no longer wanted to live and asked how she would feel if i ended it .
i wanted to know whether she would agree with it .
all i wanted to hear is
she thought about it for a while and then she said :
prime minister manuel valls wants to establish a new french islamic foundation , which would act as a bridge between the french state and france &apos;s muslims .
after the terrorist attacks , france is stepping up its fight against radical islamists , and the government is calling on the muslim minority to help .
&quot; if muslims will not help the republic to fight against those who undermine public freedoms , it will be increasingly hard for the republic to guarantee their freedom of worship , &quot; said prime minister manuel valls .
he wants to ensure that only clerics trained in france are allowed to practice in mosques and other places of worship .
he also wants to stop funding of mosques from abroad , because the funding is usually accompanied &quot; imported &quot; foreign imams who then spread radical agendas in mosques .
by october , prime minister valls wants to establish a new french islamic foundation , which would act as a bridge between the french state and france &apos;s muslims .
the new institution will replace the “ foundation for islam of france ” , which was founded in 2005 by former prime minister dominique de villepin
with the objective to make the financial flows between mosques and countries that that fund their construction more transparent .
it was , however , soon hit by internal divisions , and it never worked properly .
&quot; it is a total failure , &quot; said valls recently .
the new foundation is likely to be headed by jean-pierre chevènement , the former minister of interior and defence , who is known as a supporter of the secular state .
there are roughly 2,500 mosques and places of worship in france , of which some 120 are thought to be under the influence of radical islam .
since 2012 , authorities have expelled about 80 of imams and dozens are currently under consideration .
this week , the german police also took action against radical clerics ,
who were allegedly recruiting fighters for the islamic state .
one of them operated a facility which was reportedly radicalising believers who later attacked a sikh temple in essen .
in the aftermath of the attack on the charlie hebdo magazine in january 2015 , a debate over a new institution that would replace the largely defunct foundation ignited in france .
this urgency has been augmented by further terrorist attacks in france carried out by radicalised islamists in the name of the islamic state .
it will have two main tasks - to ensure that mosques are funded from domestic sources and to monitor imams .
it is not clear yet how the new foundation will be funded , even though a number of proposals are being considered .
one of them would be a special charge on halal food , i.e. mainly meat from animals slaughtered according to islamic principles .
this charge would , in practice , be paid by the vendors of halal food for certification .
part of this money would then go to the foundation .
another option would be for french pilgrims heading to mecca to pay a contribution of ten to twenty euros .
every year , around 30,000 french muslims go on this pilgrimage to saudi arabia .
in addition , only preachers trained at local universities should be permitted to practice in mosques .
this is designed to ensure that sermons are compatible with democracy .
the government is also shutting down radical mosques .
&quot; we have shut down twenty mosques since december and other will follow , &quot; said the interior minister bernard cazeneuve .
&quot; there is no place in france for those who preach hatred and do not respect the principles of our country , such as equality between women and men , &quot; he said .
zaragoza .
on friday morning , an unnamed gunman seriously injured his ex-wife in a shopping centre in zaragoza in northern spain , the newspaper independent reported .
the shooting took place after the woman and her daughter left a garage in their car .
the man was reportedly waiting in another car from which he opened fire .
according to witnesses , the man then turned the weapon on himself , the independent reported .
the woman was taken to the hospital by her uninjured daughter , while the man in critical condition was taken there by ambulance .
the shooting took place at around 11 : 00 local time in the centre of the capital of the autonomous region of aragon , not far from the local university .
the independent is citing the spanish news agency europa press , according to which the motive was likely related to unresolved issues surrounding the couple &apos;s recent divorce .
rolls with asparagus , wakame seaweed , ginger and chilli sauce .
while summer is the time to enjoy light , easily digestible meals , we czechs are rebels , and we are quite stubborn when it comes to our tastes .
our al fresco restaurants like to serve grilled pork , brisket or pork knuckles .
nothing too healthy , nothing too light , except perhaps for a salad or roasted vegetables here and there .
barbecuing not only saves time and crockery , it is also a social event without anyone having to spend hours in the kitchen .
however , there are alternatives how to prepare treats , which will inject some variety into dining . their preparation is a bit of a ritual but on the other hand , there is no need to spend hours in the kitchen baking , frying or stewing anything .
what is more , they will make you healthier .
whether it &apos;s homemade sushi or sashimi , where quality ingredients and a bit of skill will make the preparation enjoyable and the food itself a real exotic delicacy .
this also applies to the even easier rice paper rolls from today &apos;s recipe ,
which allows you to skip the more time-consuming cooking and cooling of rice .
you only need to submerge the paper for a few seconds in water and the rest with regard to the filling and ingredients is up to the cook and his imagination .
all seaweed is not created the same .
the advantage of asian cuisine these days is that the ingredients are today readily available .
including the pickled sweet and sour ginger , which is one of the basic accompaniments for fresh sushi or rolls .
you can make it at home , but the genuine pink gari ginger has unique spicy and delicious taste thanks to a secret recipe , which is used to make it from various types of vinegar and ginger .
all you have to do is to buy a bag of this stuff in the right size and you will have a side dish with proven antibacterial efficacy and supporting digestion and to boost immunity against coughing or the flu .
banana leaves .
they are used primarily in buddhist and hindu cultures when serving and decorating dishes for a variety of ceremonial occasions and rituals .
long ribbed banana leaves are widespread in many countries in asia and south america as tools to prepare a variety of baked , boiled or fried foods , which are packed into them like in an aluminium foil .
banana leaves also lend food a specific flavour .
they are available here in specialised stores selling exotic fruits and vegetables , pre-cut into pieces .
only choose leaves that are bright green and healthy , i.e. without cracks and spots
the preparation of a salad made from wakame seaweed , sesame and sesame oil is similarly straight forward .
this is available frozen .
those who often eat or prepare sushi will be familiar with nori seaweed .
in japan , it is one of the most important species of seaweed , which is cut , pressed and dried to prepare nori leaves , which in turn are used to prepare sushi .
wakame − the dark green seaweed growing in the waters around the island of hokkaido − can be eaten fresh or dried and is as popular as nori .
most people are familiar with wakame miso soup , which is said to have been used by asian women since ancient times to recover after childbirth .
in general , this seaweed is considered to have miraculous powers .
it purifies the blood , strengthens blood circulation , it is also said to prevent the greying of hair , and it is packed with minerals .
dried and shredded wakame is also used as a spice for seasoning rice , for example .
fresh seaweed should be first leached in water then rinsed , plunged into boiling water and cooked for 30 seconds .
next , they cool it in ice water , cut out the centre ribbing and processed further to prepare e.g. this popular salad .
nevertheless , it is much easier to buy the ready-made , frozen version of the product .
all that remains is to prepare a roll with a simple vegetable filling , which is both delicious and light and full of healthy flavours .
this is such a fountain of youth .
you have to resist adding a grilled pork belly .
healthy &amp; light summer dishes
asians know how to do this .
all you need is a few special ingredients and bit of skill , and you will create an interesting , fresh meal , which is a delicious combination of various flavours .
it is finished in no time .
four pieces of rice paper , 40 g carrots 40 g white radish , 100 g green asparagus , 60 g cucumber 60 g wakame seaweed and 60 g of sweet chilli sauce .
handful of chopped coriander , teaspoon black sesame , teaspoon sriracha chili sauce , 20 g mango and 40 g pickled gari ginger , a few pine nuts .
first , we will prepare the rolls .
soak the rice paper for five seconds in the cold water .
next , take it out and wait until it softens .
in the meantime , cook the asparagus tips briefly in hot water and cool them in cold water after roughly three minutes .
we place the vegetable filling on the softened paper and wrap it .
we will prepare the filling from white radish , carrots and cucumber , cut into fine strips , mix them with sweet chilli sauce , add chopped coriander , mix it thoroughly and add to the rice paper .
we place the asparagus tips on the banana leaf , add the rolls and garnish the dish with wakame seaweed , pickled ginger , a slice of mango and we sprinkle black sesame and pine nuts on the top .
britain settle for silver in rugby sevens after fiji masterclass sees them take gold
great britain &apos;s impressive run in the rugby 7s was brought to a crashing halt at the final hurdle by fiji in the final on thursday night when they were comprehensively beaten 43-7 at the deodoro stadium here in rio .
fiji gave a masterclass in handling , off-loading , side-stepping , support play , running lines and brute strength to win gold - their first olympic medal of any colour .
defeat came with the non-too shabby consolation of silver - britain &apos;s third of the day - and they could be proud of their efforts in the inaugural olympic 7s tournament in which they beat new zealand , argentina and south africa along the way .
the bruising beating of the boks , 7-5 in the semi-final earlier in the day , may have come back to bite them in the final .
but , regardless , fiji on this form would have beaten a fit as a fiddle 15-man team .
it may be some consolation to gb - but probably not - that at least one briton will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow : fiji &apos;s head coach is ben ryan , the former england boss from wimbledon .
it has been some journey for gb .
eight years ago , under ryan , they lost every game at the adelaide sevens .
here , they lost just one .
this hammering will hurt but the progress is startling .
fiji started magnificently , bouncing off gb tackles for fun .
it was like running into a series of moving buses for captain tom mitchell and co and the world series champions went 5-0 up when osea kolinisau dived over in the corner .
with four minutes on the clock jerry tuwai added another down the right wing , which was converted .
12-0 and gb had hardly touched the ball .
a superb mitchell tackle stopped the man-mountain leone nakarawa from scoring a third but it was only delaying fiji .
on seven minutes jasa veremalua touched down in the right corner and gb were 17-0 to the bad .
nakarawa added another from the restart and there was still over a minute on the clock ... in the first half .
vatemo ravouvou then burst through some more limp gb tackling and stormed to the line to score .
the conversion made it 29-0 at the break .
it was as if fiji had been born to play 7s , while gb are still learning the trade .
which is pretty much how it is .
gb made wholesale changes at half-time and they plugged the fijian dam ... for all of four minutes , which by first-half standards was good , until josua tuisova went over after some brilliant fijian interplay .
dan norton grabbed a try for gb , touching down in the left corner to make it 36-7 but the game was long gone the way of the south sea islanders whose fans sang , waved flags and danced in the stands .
it was hard not to admire fiji &apos;s whole joyful approach .
mata viliame iced the fijian cake that didn &apos;t need icing with another try in the dying moments .
the whistle went , the fijians embraced and gb hit the turf , thoroughly beaten .
earlier in the day , fiji had beaten japan 20-5 in their semi-final and gb edged south africa in a tight semi-final of one try each - britain &apos;s conversion the difference .
kyle brown put the boks ahead in the first half but dan norton with some dazzling footwork broke the line and scored under the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late tackle from marcus watson , brother of england &apos;s 15-aside team , anthony , secured the win - and ultimately the silver medal .
helen glover and heather stanning inspired to rowing victory by coach &apos;s cancer battle
there will not be a more emotive gold at these games , and that is saying something .
from the first stroke to the last , 220 punishing heaves into history , helen glover and heather stanning found added meaning in their golden moment at the estacio da lagoa .
though they were the two pulling on the oars , there were three voices in that boat , the echo of coach robin williams ever present as they powered to a second successive olympic gold in the women &apos;s pairs , the first females in the annals of british sport to scale such a height .
their dominance was absolute , after all this was their 39th outing unbeaten , again unprecedented .
what we see , two brilliant athletes skating over the surface with the elegance of swans , does not wholly reflect the nature of the triumph .
behind every rowing gold is a battalion of willing hands contributing the incremental gains that make the difference , and no hands were more instrumental than those of a coach who 30 months ago did not know whether he would live to see this day when diagnosed with cancer .
as he said , it was touch and go .
i had bladder cancer which is one of the things they can operate on and they did .
if they don &apos;t it goes everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it alters your outlook a bit .
williams was diagnosed in december 2013 .
the trio were fortunate that he was able to begin his treatment at the start of 2014 out of season , keeping the disruption to a minimum , if that is ever the right expression in circumstances such as these .
i needed to get paid so i had to get better quickly .
it was an incentive .
i was in hospital and i was walking around the ward - 20ft , 30ft 50ft at a time when they were saying a few steps is enough .
that &apos;s how it starts off .
rowing in itself is a journey but that makes it a bit bigger .
in the immediacy of victory their first thoughts were for williams , who had spent a nervy morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to process his own anxieties .
stanning , a captain in the royal artillery regiment with a tour of afghanistan behind her , said &quot; i &apos;ve been an emotional wreck this week , maybe that &apos;s a bit extreme , but it means such a lot . &quot;
it just reiterates how much this means to me , how much me and helen have worked and robin as well .
it &apos;s been a fantastic three years back with helen and robin .
without robin we would be nobody , so a massive thanks to him he &apos;s the best coach in the world .
i couldn &apos;t have asked for a better person to train with , or a better coach .
helen glover and heather stanning haven &apos;t lost a race in five years .
the pair set a punishing rhythm that their rivals could never match .
even in the final 500 metres when the crews from new zealand and denmark began to close , stanning and glover had too much in reserve .
we were very much in the moment .
helen was calling &apos; stay in the process , stay in the process &apos; .
it &apos;s really important not to get carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren &apos;t looking to do anything amazing .
we weren &apos;t looking for fireworks today , we were just looking to do a good row and to go out and win that race , which we did .
the pair will take a year before deciding their futures .
glover has a wedding to attend next month , her own to television adventurer steve backshall .
for now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
i didn &apos;t want to say this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in london it took about six months to realise that i was an olympic champion .
it was all so new and i was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
this feels so much better , &quot; she said .

prison ?
i would prefer if they had to drive people for free , says the taxi mafia hunter rubeš in connection with the ground-breaking prosecution .
according to Čt , the defendants are six taxi drivers and a former official of the municipal government in prague .
you &apos;ve made a number of reports in which you uncovered the fraudulent practices of those who are in the group which is now being prosecuted .
you had to face several unpleasant skirmishes with those you have exposed .
to what extent does this news of members of this organised gang being prosecuted represent a breakthrough for you ?
i did expect that this would go to court at some stage .
i am mainly curious about the verdict ,
but i do not think that they should be in jail .
that is useless .
they should , in the first place , repay all the stolen money ,
by having to drive people for free .
this is a somewhat strange solution .
does it mean that you do not consider the likely punishment handed down by the court to be sufficiently effective ?
i consider it sufficient that some of them are now so scared that they left the profession .
one of them is now working as a waiter , another is delivering pizza and one of them has given up completely .
the defendants can theoretically get two to eight years in prison .
do you think this is an adequate tariff ?
i have a problem with custodial sentences in general .
i consider them to be an ineffective form of punishment .
it is nonsense to put somebody behind bars in a case like this .
such people should be forced to give back to society what they have taken away .
they have been destroying our country &apos;s reputation by brazenly stealing from people for twenty-five years .
so now they should restore the country &apos;s reputation by having to drive people for free .
i cannot think of a better form of punishment .
it would work like a community service .
as others are required to collect garbage , they would get a car to drive people around prague for free .
no , i think that in the end , they will get a suspended sentence and they will not care .
they will find another way how to defraud others .
he studied at the film academy of miroslav ondříček in písek and subsequently , at tomáš baťa university in zlín .
mr rubeš is one of the people , who started creating videos directly for the web in the czech republic and the person behind many viral videos .
he works as a journalist for the online broadcaster stream.cz , where he is involved in a number of shows . he is currently working on the prague guide , which is intended primarily for foreign audiences .
this is a series of short reports , in which rubeš advises foreign visitors which services they should be using and what they should avoid .
he has previously filmed shows with titles &quot; jak na to &quot; &#91; what to do &#93; , &quot; město podvodů ? &quot; &#91; city of fraud ? &#93; , &quot; Život v luxusu &quot; &#91; life in luxury &#93; , &quot; a dost ! &quot; &#91; enough ! &#93; and &quot; praha vs. prachy &quot; &#91; prague vs money &#93; . vutium a prometheus , brno a praha 2001 . fast cash
in the indictment , they are referred to as an organised group .
the police followed them for several months .
can this group of fraudulent taxi drivers be described as a mafia-style group ?
they seem to be &quot; nice &quot; mobsters compared to those from the godfather .
this is more about mobsters-juniors , but they are definitely organised .
if nothing else they are watching the taxi ranks for each other .
they have prague divided into different zones .
i have observed , for example , that those at the main railway station do not like those in pařížská , and those in pařížská , in turn , do not have cordial relations with drivers at karlovy lázně ( disco club )
they all are watching their taxi ranks and each group is organised in some way .
it is probably a complex network ,
but there are altogether only seven defendants - six taxi drivers and one official from the municipal government who is accused of warning the drivers ahead of controls .
as you have said , this undesirable element has not disappeared from the streets .
what percentage of prague taxi drivers do you consider to be fraudulent ?
while it is only a very small percentage ,
the worst of them are still roaming the streets .
i am talking about aleš ryjáček , for example .
this is a man who is really dangerous - he carries an expandable baton in his car , and every friday and saturday , he is at the taxi rank near charles bridge and drives people around the city .
when i was in his taxi the last time , he wanted me to pay him three hundred czech crowns for three kilometres .
the police has not detained him for some reason .
they only picked a few people from that large group .
the situation is very similar in other locations in prague .
the indictment of seven people will hardly eradicate a well-known prague vice , which appears to be much bigger .
on the other hand , i would not say that this was a completely futile exercise .
it will help , but it will not eradicate all the evil .
do the taxi drivers who prey on foreign tourists still frequent the same locations which you have showed in your reports , i.e. near the charles bridge or pařížská ?
yes .
they continue breaking the laws and regulations from these very locations day in and day out .
this is being ignored by the metropolitan police and the prague magistrate .
this can no longer be dismissed just as &quot; absurdistan , &quot; this is utter indifference .
the business of the prague taxi drivers in numbers
still , some of them , even if it is only a small minority , will end up in court .
this is a breakthrough .
i have to ask you whether you now feel vindicated ?
vindication was not my objective . my goal has always been to make the centre of prague a better place .
even if i felt that we have achieved something in this regard , i will continue .
you have to keep pushing .
even if there is only one last thief remaining , we should continue to make our best effort to catch and remove him .
you cannot be happy with that .
in reality , however , there are many more out there .
are you still trying to confront them directly in their taxis ?
i sometimes take test rides , and i have to say that the situation is still bad .
just last week i caught a taxi driver , from the same group , and he looked surprised to see me again .
he charged me 560 czech crowns for three kilometres , and claimed the amount was 56 crowns ( he used the trick with the decimal point ) .
it had a receipt , so i called the police and this taxi driver was delightfully , cheeky when he kept asking the police officers when he would be paid those 56 crowns .
a similar case .
the taxi driver put a sticker over the decimal on the clock to lift 357 crowns from tourists .
is it safe to say that these fraudsters have not stopped their activities even after you have shown the faces of those who charged ridiculous amounts for a short ride ?
they have an incredible cheek .
what happened to the taxi driver who demanded his 56 crowns ?
the police sent him away , claiming they cannot discuss the matter any further there because he issued a receipt .
i think that this will be also an issue in court ( proceedings against six taxi drivers and one former official ) .
on the one side , there will be a taxi driver with his receipts and on the other , the police .
in accordance with the decision of the supreme administrative court , the magistrate is not allowed to use secret recordings from the taxi as evidence in court .
when i filmed the series about their scams , the taxi drivers themselves told me about this precedent .
nevertheless , i always only wanted to use the footage in the reports .
are you worried that this could effectively result in them walking free ?
i hope that the judges will understand that no taxi driver can make a living charging six or ten crowns per kilometre .
you spoke about the trick with the decimal point , which the fraudsters use to scam foreign customers .
is this still happening or are they worried to use this trick after you have reported on it ?
i think that by broadcasting the report we have made this trick even more popular .
i was sitting in a taxi recently , and the taxi driver was bragging that he was the only honest taxi driver .
but then i noticed that there was a black tape at the side of the taximeter clock .
when i asked him what it was , he replied :
if fines did not quite work as a deterrent , will a trial of their colleagues do the trick ?
is there something at all that could deter them from scamming people ?
you said that you believed that they would always find a way how to cheat .
i do not think that there are any truly effective deterrents .
however , they could be pushed out from the taxi ranks ,
either by honest taxi drivers , who should really fight more to squeeze them out .
it is my experience that the fair taxi drivers are thankfully in the majority .
do they want to push back against those who are damaging the reputation of their services ?
there is a will , but they lack the skills .
they do not quite know how to handle the situation , and they find it difficult to formulate in more certain terms what they want .
when they staged the demonstration ( because of blanket restrictions proposed by the office of the mayor of prague adriana krnáčová ) , they did not come across as if they knew exactly what they wanted .
on the one hand , they claimed that their protest was not against uber , that they only want the same conditions as uber does , on the other they said they wanted more than uber .
the result was that they completely stopped the flow of traffic in prague , which served as the best possible advertisement for uber .
how do you rate overall the approach of the prague magistrate to the issue of fare overcharging ?
it is obvious , that the criminal police had to get involved to handle the matter .
the magistrate did not have clout to deal with the problem .
they had a mole there who was passing on information , which means that their taxi department &apos;s efforts were futile for several years .
i hope that they will ask the official to pay for all the checks that came to nothing because of his activities , so that he realises what he has done .
i think that this is the worst thing .
i was even with him on one of these test rides as i discovered when i checked the schedule afterwards .
it has been several months since you have released the final episodes of your show .
what was the response ?
i mainly heard from foreign viewers , who were our primary focus .
whenever my friends are over from abroad , i play them the videos .
when we then go for a walk , they are surprised to find that the people from the footage are still there at staroměstské náměstí -
especially those infamous prague celebrities .
seriously ,
i would build a fence around them like in a museum .
museum of communism right here on the street .
my last question is clear .
do you take a taxi when you need it ?
yes i do .
i use taxis where i can pay by card rather than cash .
i use services such as uber or liftago , where the drivers have no chance to cheat
there are also many taxi companies which are fair .
i have only hailed a cab on a street once since then .
once i got into the taxi , the driver said :
bém disguised as an italian tourist .
the fraudulent practices of taxi drivers were an issue already back in 2005 .
the former mayor , pavel bém , took a test ride disguised as an italian tourist , and the driver immediately overcharged him by two hundred czech crowns .
the journalist rubeš had a worse experience .
the taxi driver charged him 820 czech crowns for a journey from staroměstské to václavské náměstí , which roughly translates to 195 crowns per kilometre as the documentary makers discovered .
the prague magistrate has set the maximum price at 28 crowns per kilometre .
the footage also reveals other surprising amounts being charged : for example a two kilometre ride from pařížská to truhlářská tourist costing a tourist 400 crowns .
the taxi drivers hailed from the taxi rank near karluv most were also ripping off customers .
they charge up to 600 crowns for a 2.5 kilometre ride to anděl .
marble is mainly cleaned with clean water , avoiding chemicals as much as possible and the longer the better .
it is fairly easy to clean even though from time to time you need a scalpel to remove the dirt from the creases .
it is not easy and it is not fast , said the restorer vanesa trostová from oldřichov v hájích .
what she does is very impressive : the tomb is enclosed in scaffolding , which she has to keep climbing up and down .
&quot; a restorer has to be diligent , patient and not too demanding with respect to the working conditions , &quot; she said .
this is by far not her first restoration work in the frýdlant region .
she was behind the restoration of the stone elements of the façade in the rear wing of the frýdlant town hall , the statue of st. mary magdalene in , zátiší , the statue of st. john of nepomuk in frýdlant , pieta in okružní ulice in frýdlant , marian column in frýdlant or atlanta in nové město pod smrkem .
the restoration work on the gravestone of melchior of redern , his wife catherine and their son christoph began already in 2011 .
we are currently removing deposits of dirt and crusts from the surface of the stone elements , and securing loose stone parts against falling and movement ; they may be anchored to the wall or to one another .
we are also going to treat and preserve the surface .
the tomb will once again have gold inscriptions .
&quot; next , the inscriptions on marble slabs will be gilded with pure gold leaf , &quot; said věra sobotová , the national heritage official from the frýdlant magistrate .
we do not have any records of the tomb ever being repaired .
a closer look has revealed interesting holes , drilled into the marble columns .
there are hundreds of years old , and they are remnants of the gravestone decoration .
it was richly decorated , but unfortunately after the raid by the swedes during the thirty years &apos; war , it all disappeared .
they literally stripped it bare , said ms sobotová .
the restorers feel quite at home in the church of the holy cross .
after the flood in 2010 , it was necessary to put the tombstones , which were submerged in order , we had to restore the baptismal font , the wall paintings inside the tomb and the tomb itself now .
&quot; we would also like to restore the stained glass in the future , &quot; said ms sobotová .
the church is otherwise in a very good condition as we invest every year in its repairs and maintenance .
the restoration work on the redern family tomb will cost in total 128 thousand czech crowns .
this will be covered by grants as the city will not invest its own funds in this phase of the restoration work .
one hundred thousand crowns will come from the regional round of the competition &quot; historic city of 2015 &quot; , the balance of 28 thousand crowns will be contributed by the ministry of culture , said the mayor of frýdlant dan ramzer .
it was the decision of the municipal council to release the winnings to restore the tomb .
the views of experts on the future performance of selected foreign markets tracked by indices compared with the czech capital market ( px ) over a horizon of one month and half a year .
markets are characterised by growth and low volatility .
hardly anyone predicted it at the beginning of the year .
the us-based s &amp; p 500 , which went through a 12 % correction in february , is now at a new all-time high , and it has gained another 7 % since the start of the year .
this seems to confirm the rule of thumb that traders should not bet against the interests of central banks , which have so far always achieved what they set out to do .
in a situation where us stocks are trading at their all-time highs , volatility is again decreasing . volatility is currently at its lowest since 2014 , when markets were growing thanks to the quantitative easing programme of the federal reserve and the volatility index ( vix ) held steady below 12 percent .
this is hardly a surprise .
although the federal reserve keeps preparing the markets for a gradual increase in interest rates , quantitative easing in europe and in japan is still in full swing , and in the past week , the bank of england also joined the party by committing to buy bonds worth 60 billion pounds over a period of six months .
a new wave of quantitative easing is thus pushing the already-low yields even lower , and contributes to the almost complete elimination of risk and fear of the future .
how long will this party last ?
this is , of course , the million dollar question .
there are currently no risks in sight , the world economy is going through a period of almost constant growth without any major fluctuations , the situation in the commodity markets and in china is stabilising and brexit is no longer a topic , so we should not be surprised if us shares continued in this relatively calm mode going forward .
shame that juncker did not take a leaf from klaus &apos;s book .
i am very happy that my friend michel barnier has accepted this important and challenging task .
i wanted an experienced politician for this difficult job , said the european commission president , juncker , when he appointed the french politician ( who is indeed experienced having held so many different supranational political functions that it would be hard to find a better example of so-called european elites ) to be the chief brexit negotiator for the european commission .
juncker &apos;s choice was a blow to any hope that it would be in the interest of the eu to seek forms of future friendly coexistence with the uk .
however , most of the british media interpreted the appointment of barnier to be an act of war on the part of juncker .
barnier is a die-hard european federalist ,
and he hates the uk .
as the european commissioner for the internal market ( 2009-2014 ) he was in charge of reforming the european banking law .
his view was uniquely hostile as he proved to be an unrepentant enemy of the anglo-saxon free-market concept and model of capitalism .
barnier supports multilateral regulations and he co-authored the concept of so-called banking union detesting anything that comes from the city of london and pushing through heavy-handed regulation of the financial sector and services .
michel barnier , who will be representing paris in a dispute with london , is likely to be a tough , relentless and ruthless negotiator .
this probably is not good news .
in this context , it is difficult not to look back at the peaceful separation of the czechoslovak federation , which was largely the brainchild of the prime minister vaclav klaus , who used his insight , skill and empathy in the negotiations .
this is why czechs and slovaks can be today the closest friends and allies .
it is a pity that juncker has not taken a leaf from vaclav klaus &apos;s book in this regard .
it would be to the greater benefit of all of us !
putin in the centre of a political earthquake ?
the kremlin leader dismissed his close ally and confidant ivanov .
the russian president vladimir putin on friday sacked his chief of staff sergey ivanov .
he will be replaced by anton vajno .
this was reported by the russian media , citing a press release put out by kremlin &apos;s press office .
putin signalled that he has relieved ivanov from his duties at his own request .
at a meeting broadcast by the rossiya 24 tv channel , the russian president said that he had accommodated ivanov &apos;s wish not serve longer than four years as chief of staff . a wish expressed apparently when he took office .
at the same time , he announced that mr ivanov had been appointed special presidential representative for environmental protection , ecology and transport .
the news of the replacement at the top of the president &apos;s office has come as a surprise . ivanov will be replaced by his former deputy , vajno .
ivanov , who is 63 , is considered to be one of putin &apos;s closest allies .
ivanov had a long career in the kgb and then the fsb and in the past he held the positions of defence minister and deputy prime minister .
now he is also vacating the post of the chair of the president &apos;s security council .
during the meeting with putin , ivanov said that he was a record holder in terms of holding the position of chief of staff .
he lasted four years and eight months .
in this context , he noted that during the 25 years since the role of chief of staff was established , there were 11 people holding the position .
neither kvitová nor the double act of strýcová and Šafářová will be playing in the finals .
none of friday &apos;s matches have so far been successfully converted into a place in the final .
first to lose was petra kvitová , who was beaten by the puerto rican surprise monica puig in three sets 4 : 4 , 6 : 1 and 3 : 6 .
kvitová was shortly followed by the czech double players strýcová and Šafářová .
the pair , who defeated the williams sisters , was close to winning the first set , but then missed two set balls and the russians eventually won the set in a tiebreaker .
they then proceeded to lose the second set 4 : 6 .
czech rowing recorded some success during the morning programme in rio : ondřej synek won his semifinal in single sculls by beating chroatia &apos;s damir martin almost by a second despite easing a bit at the end of the race .
today was a good day , the conditions were great , the wind had calmed down .
i tried to conserve my power as much as possible , synek said .
in contrast , his opponents had to fight ,
so this may make things easier tomorrow .
i &apos;m not saying that it will be easy , but things are looking good , said the rower from dukla prague .
mirka topinková-knapková did not follow in synek &apos;s footsteps .
the thirty-five-year-old rower came in fourth in her semifinal and on saturday , she will start in the b finals , where she will fight for seventh to twelfth place .
she will not be able to defend her gold from london .
this is the first time i failed to advance to the final at the olympic games .
it is disappointing , but it was a quality race and i gave it my all .
simply put , the competition was better , said topinková knapková .
she fought until the end believing that she will reach the elite six in her fourth consecutive games .
she only gave up shortly before the finish line .
i knew that the race was wide open , anyone could have advanced to the final .
i was surprised by the chinese rower and her strong finish .
i thought that i would be able to beat the austrian to progress to the final .
unfortunately , she delivered a performance of her lifetime , said the 2011 world champion .
the young shooter filip nepejchal was far outside the finals as he failed to qualify for the second time , this time in small-bore rifle prone
event in which he finished 33rd .
the russian team performed best in the qualification .
sergei kamensky advanced from the first place having scored 629 points and kirill grigoryan from the second with 628.9 points .
in comparison , nepejchal only scored 620.5 points .
the first track and field athletes have started their campaigns , among them the czech heptathletes kateřina cachová and eliška klučinová .
after the second discipline , cachová is currently in the eleventh place , and the czech record holder , eliška klučinová in the twenty-second .
britain &apos;s katarina johnson-thompson , who cleared 1.98 cm in the high jump , and belgium &apos;s nafissatou thiam are currently in the lead .
both have produced historically best results in high jump in the heptathlon .
they both tried to clear 201cm but failed .
the germans or russians , who is worse ?
the german society has gone through a period of profound self-reflection , but the russian society did not .
both eurasian nations produced dictators and regimes in the 20th century which were inhuman , brutal and horrific .
from 1917 to 1989 , the russian bolsheviks contributed to the 94 millions of victims of communism , as recorded in the black book of communism , whether this was related to everyday individual repressions , targeted famine , incompetent warfare or inhuman experiments .
the nazis wiped out in an inhuman way about 6 million jews and in total the total number of victims of the second world war is estimated at 60 million .
both germans and the soviets carried out atrocities in the occupied or abandoned territories .
in germany or the ussr , it was not only a few individuals who were guilty of these atrocities . large sways of population took part in these crimes , whether actively or passively as a result of cowardice or putting their heads in the sand .
this was not only exclusive to these two nations , we czechs are also guilty .
in germany , the process of denazification started in the immediate aftermath of the war , followed by the nuremberg tribunal .
the most important thing , however , came later .
dad , grandpa , how could you take part in such atrocities ?
how could you !
it brought real reflection and healing to the society .
until recently , the german elites were mainly concerned with the prosperity of the country , elimination of poverty and welfare of the country &apos;s citizens .
they may have other ( often naively-idealistic ) goals , but they cannot be accused of trying to annex alsace-lorraine or launching military attacks against another country - motivated by revenge .
there was no period of reflection in russia after they lost the cold war .
the window of opportunity to make any positive changes has definitely closed at the turn of the millennium when the former kgb ( sic ! ) officer vladimir putin came to power .
criminal past is often celebrated in russia
the main policy of putin &apos;s russia is revenge , conquest of the lost territories and the humiliation of the west .
health , prosperity and the future of the nation is not important in today &apos;s russia .
beat your own and others will be afraid .
i still believe that this only the product of decades of despotic regimes , that the russians are not genetically or culturally inferior-destined to asian-style ( self ) tyranny .
who benefits from increasing tensions over crimea ?
the ukrainian army .
in the last days and hours , the situation on the ukrainian-russian border near crimea has deteriorated .
who benefits from the growing tensions ?
after a long period of relative calm the relations between ukraine and russia have dropped to a new low .
the pretext for the ukrainian side was the crimean peninsula , which has been annexed by russia more than two years ago , and it is now part of its territory .
contradicting reports are coming from the two opposing sides , which we cannot independently verify , and therefore , we should ask ourselves the old question cui bono ?
according to reports from moscow , the ukrainian side launched terrorist attacks on crimea , which , naturally , the ukrainian side denies and in turn accuses the kremlin of provocation .
the ukrainian side responded to the information about the arrest of the members of the ukrainian special forces on the territory of russia by claiming - as they did in the savchenko case - that they must have been abducted .
if we accepted the ukrainian version of events , in what way would russia benefit from a further escalation in the situation surrounding crimea ?
the simple answer is : they would not .
the escalation of tensions around crimea can only harm russia , mainly from the west in the form of even tougher sanctions and strengthening of the anti-russian campaign .
ukraine disappeared from the spotlight last year , as the focus shifted mainly towards the refugee crisis .
the ukrainian leadership has lost all credit , as the approval rating of president poroshenko hovers around 15 % .
ukraine &apos;s economy would have gone bankrupt a long ago if it were not for the generous funding from the eu and the imf .
in this situation , the ukrainian regime desperately needs to attract attention to its country to justify requests for further financial assistance in an attempt to improve their reputation with ukrainian voters .
president poroshenko and other members of the executive branch want to be seen again as strong men who are not afraid to stand up to russia .
we can only hope that all those who are trying to unleash an open conflict between ukraine and russia eventually realise that they are responsible not only for the lives of soldiers but also civilians on both sides and stop any hostilities in time .

the us security services are said to have known about russian hacking attacks for a year .
information about russian cyber attacks came to light last month when the fbi announced that it was investigating the attack on the democratic party &apos;s servers .
nevertheless , the official reports have so far failed to mention that there was any russian involvement in the attacks .
moscow denied any involvement in the attack .
the report about the security services monitoring the alleged russian attack was top secret , because its disclosure would have made it clear that the us services are doing just that , and it also could compromise the methods and sources used .
it is alleged that two russian intelligence agencies were involved in the attack .
the new advisory board for cyber security
according to the reuters agency , the material on monitoring the russian hacks was encoded and only a small group of experts had access to it .
only a small group of eight leading members of congress , known as the gang of eight in the us was briefed .
it consists of the chiefs of both chambers mitch mcconnell and paul ryan , the democrat chairs in both chambers , nancy pelosi and harry reid , and four members of the armed services and security committee of the congress .
the acting head of the democratic party donna brazile on thursday announced that she was setting up an advisory board for cyber security to &quot; prevent future attacks and to ensure first-class protection of the servers of the democratic party . &quot;
the smoked salmon from the albert supermarket contained a dangerous parasite .
the chain apologised .
based on the health complaint from a consumer after eating the wild smoked salmon- pieces 100 g , with the use-by date of 22.11.2016 , the prague hygienists carried out inspections of the albert stores at václavské náměstí and na můstku .
the inspection found that batch l23012562 / t4 with a use-by date of 22.11.2016 , the customer complained about was no longer available and sample was therefore taken from a product from the same batch with a use-by date of 11.12.2016 .
laboratory tests confirmed the presence of anisakis spp . , anisakis simplex .
this is a common parasite present in the digestive tract of marine fish and mammals .
this worm is dangerous to humans as the larvae ingested can invade the internal organs through the stomach wall , said Šticha .
we are very sorry about the problem with this branded product .
we immediately withdrew the batch from sale , and we have also withdrawn all other batches of this product as a matter of precaution .
this is the responsibility of the supplier with whom are communicating , and we have also had the product tested , barbora vanko , the albert spokeswoman said to novinky .
any customers who have purchased the product , can return it to any of our stores for a full refund .
the larvae are normally destroyed during processing i.e. during freezing or heating .
the seller was nekton-vrňata .
the hygienists informed the veterinary services in prague and central bohemia about the dangerous product .
according to the server bezpecnostpotravin.cz , people can suffer from anisakiasis as a result of ingesting the parasite . the symptoms include stomach pains , vomiting and nausea , but some patients do not have any symptoms at all , said Čtk .
people can show symptoms on hour or up to two weeks after ingesting an infected fish which has not been sufficiently processed .
after three weeks from the onset of the disease , the larvae usually spontaneously leave the digestive tract of the host .
adult worms and larvae are sensitive to high or low temperatures , and are therefore killed either during heat processing or freezing .
the veterinary service has inspected the salmon at the premises of the recipient of the imported goods in the central bohemia .
three of the five examined samples tested positive for the parasite .
according to the state veterinary service ( svs ) , the shipment containing 1700 products came to the czech republic at the beginning of april .
it was mainly delivered to the ahold chain of supermarkets , which received 919 packs to date .
we are currently in the process of withdrawing all unsold stocks from the stores , said the spokesman of svs petr pejchal to Čtk on friday .
upon discovery of the positive samples , the veterinary service immediately banned the delivery of further products from the warehouse .
seventeen-year-old british teenager wanted to flee from raqqa , and is reported to have been killed by a russian air strike .
after the initial excitement and quick marriage to a jihadist , who was soon killed , came the sobering .
the caliphate paradise quickly turned into hell on earth for the british girls from which there was no escape .
the girl was , according to relatives , in touch with her sister halima .
she called her repeatedly in the uk and confided to her that he wanted to come home .
to leave the islamic state is like an attempt to escape from alcatraz .
they have orders to shoot indiscriminately , the daily telegraph quoted the lawyer of the family of the dead girl , tasnime akunjee .
the family was able to trace the girl to raqqa , where she contacted them from for the last time .
this was followed by the news of her death , which cannot be verified .
the family communicated with her from their flat in east london .
they discussed how she could leave raqqa and cross the turkish border .
there hoped to reunite with the former student there .
it appears that kadiza may have been killed before she had a chance to escape , because the house , where she was staying was levelled to the ground in an air raid in may , said itv news .
the uk tv broadcaster added that the bomb was probably dropped by a russian aircraft attacking the is stronghold in syria .
you would do anything to get your child out of the danger zone , said tasnim akunjee , the family lawyer .
during the week when ( kadiza ) was probably planning her escape , an austrian girl was caught when she tried to escape and according to available information , beaten to death in public .
i think that ( kadiza ) interpreted it as a warning and decided to play it safe &quot; said akunjee according to the bbc .
the family would do anything .
kadiza sutlana left for syria together with her friends amira abase and shamima begum , who were both just 15 at the time , on 17 february last year .
they said at home that they were only going out .
instead , they went to gatwick airport , from where they flew to turkey , and then they crossed to the is-held territory .
according to the family lawyer , the family did everything in their power to get kadiza back .
you would do absolutely anything to get your child out of the danger zone , and this family did everything in their power to get their daughter back home .
this was not possible without risking that they will get caught , the lawyer added .
the only positive aspect is that the kadiza &apos;s fate can serve as a deterrent to other girls or boys who allow themselves to be fooled by is propaganda .
&quot; there are many cases where people went there , they realised how things really are and how much the reality differs from the promises and propaganda spread by the islamic state and they wanted to come back , &quot; said akunjee .
the fate of kadiza &apos;s classmates is not known .
as their families have not received any communications from them for some time now they have to brace themselves that they are most likely dead .
pay to go to jail .
in scotland , you can go to prison without committing a crime .
for many centuries , inveraray , the seat of the duke of argyll , was the principal county town of argyll .
from the mid-18th century the courts met in the town house on front street , and the ground floor below the courtroom served as the county prison .
the conditions were terrible for prisoners and unsurprisingly , there were many escape attempts and
some of which were successful .
the town representatives , therefore , decided to move the prison to a new location .
the new building was completed in 1848 . it was much more prisoner-friendly as it was heated and lit by gas .
it did not stay open for long and it finally closed by the end of august 1889 for economic reasons , as by this time , the smaller county jails were expensive and inefficient to run .
prisoner stories and ghost hunting
the prison opened its doors to the public hundred years later . visitors can see for themselves how different the conditions were in the old building compared to the new building .
guides in period costumes make the experience even more authentic .
visitors can see the torture chamber where they can learn about the many forms of punishment inflicted on criminals , whether it involved breaking their fingers or branding theme with hot irons .
during the tour , tourists have the opportunity to have the warder lock them up in a cell , mainly as a photo op but also to experience for themselves what it is like to be behind bars .
moreover , the inveraray jail has a reputation as one of scotland ’ s most haunted locations .
it has already been the destination of numerous groups dedicated to researching paranormal activities , and the museum continues to cater for people interested in ghost hunts .
such a night will set you back at least 300 pounds , which is roughly 9,500 czech crowns .
inveraray is not only a popular tourist attraction , it is also renowned for great food , surrounding scenery and history .
snapchat &quot; anime &quot; effect is criticized as asian caricature
snapchat says this filter is inspired by anime , but some observers say it &apos;s racially insensitive .
with its lens tool , snapchat allows some 150 million daily users to alter reality and play with identity in ways that border on the absurd .
you can turn yourself into a pineapple , a dog or a character befitting a roy lichtenstein painting .
the lenses are blunt , feature-warping tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day .
any missteps quickly enter the public record .
snapchat lenses have drawn criticism in the past with accusations that the app was promoting blackface or encouraging whitened skin tones as an ideal of beauty .
so when it pushed a lens to some users this week that gave them slanted eyes , distorted teeth and puffy cheeks , some critics called it a racist caricature of asian people - &quot; yellowface . &quot;
and they wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity .
the news and the outrage went wide on wednesday , with reports by the verge and motherboard , a day after snapchat said it had dismantled the feature .
the company offered an explanation : the lens was meant as homage to anime characters , not as a caricature of asian people .
but for observers who have experienced racism , the lens reminded them of hurtful stereotypes in action .
others roundly rejected the anime comparison .
in an email , grace sparapani , a korean american art student whose tweet about the photos was widely shared , said that the lens was &quot; hurtful and uncomfortable to say the least . &quot;
she added that &quot; it &apos;s hard to argue with the side by side comparison of the very gross asian caricature and the filter &apos;s effects .
it shows that the filter isn &apos;t just yellowface , but yellowface taken to its derogatory extreme .
snapchat is not the only company to cross these cultural tripwires .
american culture seems involved in an endless struggle over diversity and inclusion , from corporate boardrooms to hollywood and the devices we all carry in our hands .
and snapchat &apos;s huge audience of younger people - who are more racially diverse than their older counterparts - might mean that they are even more likely to expect sensitivity .
when one of snapchat &apos;s lenses creates an image that is insulting to a user , 25-year-old katie zhu said in an interview on thursday , &quot; it &apos;s much harder for these types of things to go unnoticed like they did before . &quot;
on thursday , ms. zhu , a product manager and engineer who works for medium , decided to delete her snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same .
in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said she believed that the race-related controversies reflected a lack of diversity in hiring practices at snapchat .
ms. zhu criticized the company &apos;s mostly white , all-male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag : # deletesnapchat .
&quot; it &apos;s either that they had no diverse representation of people of color on their staff to the point where they &apos;re able to make decisions like this , &quot; ms. zhu , who is chinese-american , said , &quot; or they do have some people of color who are working there , but they &apos;re not on positions where they feel safe or comfortable to speak up . &quot;
other observers share her view , a complaint that snapchat has left largely unanswered .
the company does not release figures about diversity on its staff , noting its status as a private company .
on thursday , snapchat declined to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff , but according to a spokesman , the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and on driving inclusion efforts internally .
for her part , ms. zhu said she would keep her snapchat account closed , adding , &quot; i wonder if they actually need more users like us to be able to say that this is not o.k. &quot;
military officials distorted isis intelligence , congressional panel says
officials from the united states central command altered intelligence reports to portray a more optimistic picture of the war against the islamic state in iraq and syria than events on the ground warranted , a congressional panel said in a report issued thursday .
the interim report , from a task force established by the republican chairmen of the house armed services committee , intelligence committee and defense appropriations subcommittee , found &quot; widespread dissatisfaction &quot; among central command intelligence analysts , who said superiors were doctoring their assessments of american efforts to defeat the islamic state .
central command , known as centcom , is the military headquarters in tampa , fla . , that oversees american military operations across the middle east and central asia .
&quot; intelligence products approved by senior centcom leaders typically provided a more positive depiction of u.s. antiterrorism efforts than was warranted by facts on the ground and were consistently more positive than analysis produced by other elements of the intelligence community , &quot; a news release about the report said .
&quot; what happened at centcom is unacceptable - our war fighters suffer when bad analysis is presented to senior policy makers , &quot; said representative ken calvert , republican of california .
the leadership failures at centcom reach to the very top of the organization .
the 10-page report detailed persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in central command &apos;s description and analysis of american efforts to train iraqi forces .
although it offers no definitive evidence that senior obama administration officials ordered the reports to be doctored , it describes analysts as feeling as though they were under pressure from centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the islamic state , also known as isis or isil .
&quot; throughout the first half of 2015 , many central command press releases , statements and congressional testimonies were significantly more positive than actual events , &quot; the report said .
for example , a centcom official stated publicly that a major military assault to take back mosul could begin as early as april or may 2015 .
mosul , iraq &apos;s second-largest city , remains under the control of the islamic state .
&quot; after months of investigation , this much is very clear , &quot; representative mike pompeo , republican of kansas , said in a statement .
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the united states central command &apos;s most senior intelligence leaders manipulated the command &apos;s intelligence products to downplay the threat from isis in iraq .
republicans created the task force after learning that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence about the islamic state was being manipulated .
the report released thursday is to be followed up by more extensive findings as the investigation continues .
there is an additional , ongoing investigation of centcom intelligence by the department of defense inspector general .
democratic members of the house intelligence committee released their own findings on thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the republican task force .
&quot; between 2014 and 2015 , centcom created an overly insular process for producing intelligence assessments on isil and iraqi security forces , &quot; representative adam b. schiff , the committee &apos;s top democrat , said in a statement .
this process , mr. schiff said , &quot; stalled the release of intelligence products , &quot; hurt morale among analysts and &quot; insufficiently accommodated dissenting views . &quot;
but mr. schiff and the democrats said they found no evidence that the white house tried to pressure centcom analysts to fit their conclusions to a &quot; preset or political narrative . &quot;
the preliminary results of the congressional investigation were reported tuesday by the daily beast .
last august , the new york times reported the existence of the pentagon inspector general investigation , opened after complaints by centcom analysts .
lt. cmdr. patrick evans , a pentagon spokesman , said in a statement that the defense department would not comment on the congressional report while the inspector general &apos;s investigation continued .
but he said that &quot; experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data , and the intelligence community and department of defense welcome healthy dialogue on these vital national security topics . &quot;
the investigation has repercussions beyond the question of whether the american-led bombing campaign in iraq and syria is succeeding ( an assertion now made by a growing number of defense officials ) .
but last year &apos;s allegations called into question how much president obama could rely on central command for honest assessments of military operations in iraq , afghanistan , libya and other crisis spots .
the critiques on the islamic state intelligence mirror disputes of more than a decade ago , when a centcom intelligence analyst , gregory hooker , wrote a research paper saying that the administration of president george w. bush , over many analysts &quot; objections , advocated a small force in iraq and spent little time thinking about what would follow the 2003 invasion .
mr. hooker also played a key part in the insurrection over the islamic state intelligence .
last year , officials said , mr. hooker &apos;s team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary , airstrikes against islamic state-held refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group &apos;s finances because it had built makeshift refineries to sell oil on the black market .
but the finding was not distributed outside central command , the times reported in september .
centcom &apos;s commander then , gen. lloyd j. austin iii , came under criticism last year after senate testimony viewed by many lawmakers as being an overly positive assessment of the war .
general austin retired in april and was replaced at central command by gen. joseph l. votel .
u.s. wins 4th straight in women &apos;s field hockey , setting up showdown with britain
one day after scoring three goals in a 6-1 victory over japan , katie bam scored the first two goals for the united states women &apos;s field hockey team on thursday as the americans defeated india , 3-0 .
five goals in two games should be a memorable feat , but bam , 27 , said she was not sure if she had ever done the same thing .
&quot; i have no clue , &quot; she said .
i &apos;m not really one of those people who keeps track of their goals .
here is what she does know : the americans are 4-0 in the olympic tournament and are tied for first place in their group with britain , which remained unbeaten after defeating japan , 2-0 , on thursday .
britain and the united states will meet on saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have qualified for the quarter finals , and the game will decide who finishes first in their six-team bracket and who finishes second .
the first-place finisher will avoid the powerful dutch , the leaders of the other bracket , for a bit longer when the quarter finals begin .
however saturday &apos;s game turns out , the americans have created a stir with their surprising run here , four years after finishing last among 12 teams at the london games .
bam was on that team .
she grew up in blue bell , pa . , first picked up a field hockey stick when she was 3 ( her twin older sisters played the sport at drexel ) and joined the national team when she was 16 , becoming its youngest player ever .
she missed out on the 2008 olympics when she did not make the cut for the final roster .
then came 2012 , when nothing much went right for her and her teammates .
the next year , craig parnham , an englishman , was named the coach , and things began to change .
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change , a physical change , &quot; bam said .
we didn &apos;t have the work rate in london that we have now .
we &apos;ve made a complete turnaround .
on thursday night , bam opened the scoring in the first half with a backhand shot from close in .
india had come into the game without a victory in the tournament , but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until late in the third period , when bam took charge .
she made a long run with the ball down the left side of the field , then curled into the middle and whipped the ball into the goal to give the americans a 2-0 lead .
melissa gonzalez added the final goal midway through the fourth period .
the shutout was the first of the tournament for the united states goalie , jackie briggs , who had allowed one goal in each of the first three victories .
she is on a roll .
so is bam .
&quot; we &apos;re in a good place right now , &quot; parnham said , but just how good it is will depend on the result of saturday &apos;s game .
amid the fury of the olympics , the zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , whatever time it is , it is the olympics .
the events in rio de janeiro feel constant and inescapable , a furious relay of competition and striving .
it is as if the olympic torch itself were a flaming baton , passed from archer to swimmer to gymnast to triathlete .
you can &apos;t turn on a television , read a newspaper or listen in on your neighbor &apos;s conversation in a coffee-shop line without hearing about simone biles , katie ledecky or the feud between michael phelps and chad le clos .
and then there is logan dooley .
mr. dooley , a first-time olympian and a dimpled heartthrob in the making , may well be among those household names being showcased in prime time , buoyed by sponsorships and feel-good tv commercials , if he were a swimmer , a gymnast or even a fencer .
but mr. dooley , 28 , of lake forest , calif . , is competing for the gold in olympic trampoline .
the olympic flame does not illuminate each event equally .
further from the center , partly in shadow , are those sports not universally acknowledged : air-pistol shooting , archery , badminton , taekwondo .
we will always have the breaststroke , and long may it reign .
but if i may make a modest case for my particular favorite , let me call attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
though trampoline has been an olympic event since 2000 , when it debuted at the sydney games , it has spent the intervening 16 years so barely acknowledged that many i surveyed did not realize it was an olympic sport at all .
this may be a regional ignorance .
despite sending athletes to compete , the united states has never won a medal in trampoline and did not have an athlete advance to the finals until 2012 .
the chinese and the russians tend to split the prizes for the men , and the chinese and the canadians for the women .
dong dong of china and rosie maclennan of canada will be defending their london gold medals this year .
but there is an underdog charm to trampoline , in part because it sounds , to the unenlightened ear , fitter for clown college than the olympics .
here i should confess that i am no expert , just an earthbound enthusiast .
it does have comic potential - the cartoon quaver of its never-ending bounce - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving , the two sports it essentially combines .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; derives from the spanish el trampolín , meaning &quot; diving board . &quot;
aspiring champions jump on a giant trampoline , shooting up to nearly 30 feet in the air , and are called upon to perform a series of tumbling moves ( twists , pikes and somersaults ) before eventually landing on their feet .
they are judged on execution , difficulty and &quot; flight time , &quot; according to the official olympic program .
thirty-two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in rio .
the most common olympic vector is straight ahead .
medal hopefuls must go farther , faster , up and over , in their quest for gold , sometimes to the finish , other times back and forth up and down the court .
they are chasing not only the finish line or the starting wall but also , in the televised coverage , another taunting line : that of the world , or olympic , record .
this single-minded pursuit is noble , admirable , even fanatic - and it is enough to bring even a spectator to tears .
but it is also what i find slightly exhausting about even watching the games .
from this , trampoline offers a respite .
the trampoliner &apos;s vector is up .
forward motion is not the goal .
he or she rebounds , seeming weightless as an astronaut , going up , then down , then effortlessly up again .
it is not without competition , of course , nor without difficulty , but for the duration of a routine , there is no frantic charge toward the end , no vaulting into the distance , just the dreamy , graceful suspension of time and gravity .
it is as close to zen as olympic competition gets .
the women &apos;s qualifiers and then finals will take place on friday afternoon , streaming at 1 p.m. eastern time ; the men &apos;s on saturday , also at 1 .
nbc will air the finals as part of an afternoon block beginning at 2 p.m. on both days .
in the midst of olympic mania , they promise a quiet , lovely moment , one likely to be overlooked in the general melee .
and if consciousness raising is to be achieved only by offering up male athletes for ogling and objectification - as the united states men &apos;s gymnasts recently proposed , according to the wall street journal - mr. dooley only awaits his gasping new fan base .
&quot; a generation is protesting &quot; in ethiopia , long a u.s. ally
violent protests in ethiopia
demonstrators demanding political change in ethiopia have been met with violent resistance by the government .
witnesses say that scores of protesters have been fatally shot during clashes with police .
is ethiopia about to crack ?
for the last decade , it has been one africa &apos;s most stable nations , a solid western ally with a fast-growing economy .
but in recent months , anti-government protests have convulsed the country , spreading into more and more areas .
in the last week alone , thousands of people stormed into the streets , demanding fundamental political change .
the government response , according to human rights groups , was ruthless .
witnesses said that police officers shot and killed scores of unarmed demonstrators .
videos circulating from protests thought to be from late last year or earlier this year show security officers whipping young people with sticks as they were forced to perform handstands against a wall .
the top united nations human rights official is now calling for a thorough investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult holding this country together , and moving forward , it will be even harder , &quot; said rashid abdi , the horn of africa project director for the international crisis group , a research group .
ethiopia is the second most populous nation in africa , after nigeria , and its stability is cherished by the west .
american military and intelligence services work closely with the ethiopians to combat terrorist threats across the region , especially in somalia , and few if any countries in africa receive as much western aid .
ethiopia &apos;s economy has been expanding at an impressive clip .
its infrastructure has improved drastically - there is even a new commuter train in the capital , addis ababa .
and its streets are typically quiet , safe and clean .
though ethiopia has hardly been a paragon of democracy - human rights groups have constantly cited the government &apos;s repressiveness - opposition within the country had been limited , with dissidents effectively silenced .
many have been exiled , jailed , killed or driven to the far reaches of the desert .
but that may be changing .
&quot; if you suffocate people and they don &apos;t have any other options but to protest , it breaks out , &quot; said seyoum teshome , a university lecturer in central ethiopia .
the whole youth is protesting .
a generation is protesting .
the complaints are many , covering everything from land use to the governing coalition &apos;s stranglehold on power .
after a widely criticized election last year , the governing party and its allies got the last seat the opposition had held and now control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time , tensions are rising along the border with eritrea ; a battle along that jagged , disputed line claimed hundreds of lives in june .
analysts fear that separatist groups that had been more or less vanquished in recent years , like the oromo liberation front or the ogaden national liberation front , may try to exploit the turbulence and rearm .
several factors explain why bitter feelings , after years of simmering beneath the surface , are exploding now .
the first is seemingly innocuous : smartphones .
only in the last couple of years have large numbers of ethiopians been able to communicate using social media as cheaper smartphones became common and internet service improved .
even when the government shuts down access to facebook and twitter , as it frequently does , especially during protests , many people are still able to communicate via internet proxies that mask where they are .
several young ethiopians said this was how they gathered for protests .
second , there is more solidarity between oromos and amharas , ethiopia &apos;s two largest ethnic groups .
oromos and amharas are not natural allies .
for eons , amharas from ethiopia &apos;s predominantly christian highlands flourished in politics and business , exploiting the oromos , many of whom are muslim and live in lowland areas .
but that is changing as well .
&quot; we are on the way to coordinate under one umbrella , &quot; said mulatu gemechu , an oromo leader .
the biggest protests have been in amhara and oromo areas .
many amharas and oromos feel ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the tigrayan ethnic group , which makes up about 6 percent of the population and dominates the military , the intelligence services , commerce and politics .
the third reason behind the unrest is the loss of meles zenawi .
mr. meles , a former rebel leader , was ethiopia &apos;s prime minister for 17 years , until his death from an undisclosed illness in 2012 .
he was considered a tactical genius , a man who could see around corners .
analysts say he was especially adept at detecting early signals of discontent and using emissaries to massage and defang opponents .
&quot; the current regime lacks that ground savvy , &quot; mr. abdi , the conflict analyst , said .
ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , hailemariam desalegn , was plucked from relative obscurity to fill mr. meles &apos;s shoes .
unlike mr. meles , who came from the tigray region of northern ethiopia , mr. hailemariam is a southerner .
analysts say he does not have the trust of the tigrayan-controlled security services .
the result , many fear , is more bloodshed .
the last time ethiopia experienced such turmoil was in 2005 , after thousands protested over what analysts have said appeared to be an election the government bungled and then stole .
in the ensuing crackdown , many protesters were killed , though fewer than in recent months , and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly .
development experts have praised ethiopia &apos;s leaders for visionary infrastructure planning , such as the new commuter train , and measurable strides in fighting poverty .
but clearly that has not stopped the internal resentment of ethiopia &apos;s government from intensifying .
and it is taking a dangerous ethnic shape .
last month , protesters in gondar , an amhara town , attacked businesses owned by tigrayans , and anti-tigrayan hatred is becoming more common in social media .
analysts say the protests are putting the united states and other western allies in an awkward position .
the american government has used ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring somalia , though it recently said it closed that base .
while the west clearly wants to support democracy , it also does not want its ally in an already volatile region to crumble .
&quot; that , &quot; mr. abdi said , &quot; is a very tight rope to walk . &quot;
donald trump explains his obama-founded-isis claim as &quot; sarcasm &quot;
donald j. trump tried to quash the latest controversy engulfing his campaign on friday by claiming that he was not serious when he insisted several times this week that president obama and hillary clinton were the &quot; founders &quot; of the islamic state terrorist group .
the clarification raised new questions about the republican presidential nominee &apos;s ability to communicate clearly to the american public .
it also put his surrogates , who have strained to defend him during a tumultuous stretch , in the awkward position of having to explain remarks that he might not mean .
after making the suggestion at a rally on wednesday night , mr. trump doubled down on the assertion on thursday , insisting in interviews that he really did intend to say that the president and mrs. clinton had created isis .
but in an early-morning twitter post on friday , mr. trump said that he was just being sarcastic .
the post was a reversal from just a day ago , when mr. trump said in a number of interviews that he was indeed serious about the charge .
when the conservative radio host hugh hewitt tried to help mr. trump soften the remark by reminding him that mr. obama wants to destroy isis , the republican presidential nominee would not have it .
the latest firestorm comes as mr. trump has been trying to refocus his campaign on the economy amid declining poll numbers .
mr. trump and mrs. clinton gave dueling economic speeches in michigan this week .
on friday , mr. trump tried again to return to that subject .
taking again to twitter , he warned that mrs. clinton &apos;s proposals would come with higher taxes and he said that he found her speech boring .
mr. trump has used the sarcasm defense before .
in late july , after he drew widespread criticism by appearing to suggest that the russians should hack mrs. clinton &apos;s emails , he later explained his remarks by saying , &quot; of course i &apos;m being sarcastic . &quot;
the approach allows mr. trump to push the limits of political speech and dial it back as needed .
&quot; i think it &apos;s a pattern of him testing certain messages that resonate with his fans , seeing how they play , and then &quot; clarifying &quot; one way or another depending on the reaction , &quot; said ruth sherman , a communications expert who has been monitoring the language used by both candidates .
but i also think he &apos;s clever about his statements and knows they are vague enough to be filtered through various lenses .
instead of toning things down for a general election audience , mr. trump has taken an even more caustic tone in recent days as his poll numbers have continued to tumble .
a new nbc / wall street journal / marist poll released on friday showed mr. trump trailing mrs. clinton by large margins in north carolina , virginia and colorado and locked in a tight race in florida .
while mr. trump generally tries to avoid apologizing for provocative things that he says , he often accuses his critics of misconstruing his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor .
but as he faces heightened scrutiny during the final months of the presidential campaign , mr. trump &apos;s jokes have put his loyal allies in the uncomfortable position of having to publicly stand up for him no matter how provocative his remarks .
rudolph w. giuliani , the former new york city mayor who is one of mr. trump &apos;s most prominent surrogates , went to great lengths to defend the candidate in an interview with cnn on thursday .
&quot; i think what he &apos;s saying there is legitimate , political commentary , &quot; mr. giuliani said when questioned about the veracity of mr. trump &apos;s assertion about mr. obama and mrs. clinton having founded the islamic state .
it is true in a sense that before obama , isis was an almost unknown , small little organization , he who called it the jayvee , totally wrong , and here &apos;s why it happened , because he withdrew the troops from iraq .
most mainstream republicans try to argue that the obama administration , in which mrs. clinton served as secretary of state , allowed isis to fester by failing to aggressively manage the situation in the middle east .
ahead of rallies in pennsylvania on friday , mr. trump continued to lash out on twitter at the news media for harping on his every word and for being biased against him .
he mocked the &quot; poor , pathetic &quot; television pundits who try to figure him out and said , &quot; they can &apos;t ! &quot;
some democrats scoffed at mr. trump &apos;s excuse as more evidence that he is unfit to be president .
once priced out , a cafe returns in greenpoint
verb cafe was a shabby , cash-only space in williamsburg that had no wi-fi but served good coffee for 15 years .
naturally , it got priced out of its bedford avenue storefront .
the store that replaced the verb in the summer of 2014 , soap cherie , sells soaps in the shape of cupcakes .
locals bemoaned it as the latest loss in a gentrifying city .
the artist molly crabapple wrote on twitter , &quot; new york is change , i know , but still , can &apos;t believe cbgb &apos;s is dead and the chelsea hotel is gutted and verb is now a soap shop . &quot;
but if new york is change , it is also reinvention .
a revived verb cafe opened last november in greenpoint , less than a mile north of the original location .
the new verb has wi-fi and accepts credit cards but has some of the same employees and a similar unpretentious vibe .
the coffee is still good , too .
leading the new verb is cisco rodriguez , a longtime employee at the old cafe who is an owner and the general manager at the new place .
he started at verb in 2001 and was there until the end .
when a customer offered to bankroll him in a new outpost , he said he was excited to do it .
mr. rodriguez , 36 , kept a lot of things the same .
verb uses the same distributor for the bagels and bought the same model of espresso machine .
it even reused the lights from the old verb .
but mr. rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
bacon-egg-and-cheese sandwiches are on the menu , and toppings like capers and sautéed onions are available .
there are brown-rice bowls .
the cafe no longer serves beer but now makes fresh juices .
nine months in , mr. rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regulars .
&quot; a lot of former customers got priced out of williamsburg too , &quot; he said .
on a recent sunday , rebecca oliveira was one such customer .
ms. oliveira , 34 , used to live in williamsburg and went to verb frequently .
even after she moved to greenpoint , she would still make the trek .
after verb closed , she said , she gave up drinking coffee for a while .
&quot; i realized it was the coffee and the culture at verb that i liked , &quot; she said .
now she &apos;s back on coffee , although that day , instead of her usual iced coffee , she went with a blended chai drink , another new addition .
tom rosenthal , another longtime customer , went faithfully to verb starting in 2003 .
he &apos;d go before work and order the same thing without fail .
&quot; quarter past seven , every day , like clockwork , i &apos;d come in and they were making my everything bagel with butter , &quot; he said .
photo mr. rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and introduced new ingredients to the menu .
these days , mr. rosenthal still gets his regular order , but sometimes he &apos;ll switch things up with the bacon , egg and cheese on an everything bagel .
mr. rodriguez said he had no hard feelings about the soap shop taking over the old space .
in fact , the soap cherie owners offered to make special soap for verb , using the cafe &apos;s cold-brewed coffee as an ingredient .
&quot; i think we still might take them up on it , &quot; mr. rodriguez said .
and greenpoint &apos;s traditional polish residents have embraced the cafe as well .
one of these new customers translated the menu into polish , and mr. rodriguez said he planned to find a spot to display it soon to make his new neighbors feel welcome .
the new location has other perks .
a local juice spot wants to bottle and sell the cold-brewed coffee .
there is a chance the cafe will expand into an adjacent building .
for many customers , a new verb to get their old favorites is enough .
joseph whitt was a regular and said he was heartbroken when they closed .
when the new space opened , mr. whitt said , walking in and getting a coffee felt like a homecoming .
&quot; i &apos;ve needed to smell that , &quot; he said .
the depressing food of the depression , in &quot; a square meal &quot;
in march 1933 , shortly after ascending to the presidency , franklin delano roosevelt sat down to lunch in the oval office .
a gourmand , president roosevelt had a taste for fancy fifth avenue foods like pâté de foie gras and maryland terrapin soup .
his menu that day was more humble : deviled eggs in tomato sauce , mashed potatoes and , for dessert , prune pudding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who were suffering , &quot; jane ziegelman said .
her husband , andrew coe , added , &quot; it was also a message to americans about how to eat . &quot;
the couple , who live in brooklyn heights , are food historians .
mr. coe &apos;s last book , &quot; chop suey , &quot; was about chinese cuisine in america , while ms. ziegelman told the story of life in a lower east side tenement through food in her book &quot; 97 orchard . &quot;
their new , collaborative work , &quot; a square meal , &quot; which will be published tuesday by harper , is a history of american food in the great depression .
showing some culinary solidarity of their own , they met a reporter for dinner at eisenberg &apos;s sandwich shop , a tiny no-frills lunch counter in the flatiron district that has been in business since the year of the crash , 1929 .
ms. ziegelman , 54 , ordered a cream cheese and chopped olive sandwich , while mr. coe , 57 , had the turkey , mashed potatoes and vegetable medley .
when a reporter ordered meatloaf , the couple deemed it fitting for a discussion of depression-era eating .
&quot; loaves were very popular , &quot; ms. ziegelman said .
there was peanut loaf , liver loaf , bean loaf .
they were made from an ingredient and a cheap thing that stretches the ingredient out .
imagine eating enough peanuts to serve as your dinner .
mr. coe grimaced .
&quot; it must have sat in your stomach like lead , &quot; he said .
in the years before the depression , the american table , especially in rural areas , was an all-you-can-eat buffet .
teams of women cooked for male farmworkers , and fresh-baked pie was served at breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was americans who had sent food to starving europeans during world war i. &quot; a square meal &quot; chronicles the ways the nation coped with suddenly not being the land of plenty .
&quot; this was a time when food became a central , fraught subject for the american people , &quot; mr. coe said , explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it .
equally fraught was the new budget diet : mystery dishes like loaves and casseroles became staples , the casserole a &quot; wonderful way to repurpose leftovers , &quot; ms. ziegelman noted , because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy coating of sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit .
meat , for years the center of the american meal , became a sparingly apportioned luxury .
strange mashups were tried as caloric and nutritional fulfillment took precedent over taste or even common kitchen sense .
in researching the book , which includes recipes , ms. ziegelman prepared a period dish of baked onion stuffed with peanut butter .
&quot; it was not a popular addition to the dinner table , &quot; mr. coe said .
ms. ziegelman amplified : &quot; it was surreal . &quot;
peanut butter has nothing to say to a baked onion .
it was characteristic of a lot of the home-ec recipes .
as never before or since , home economists - among them louise stanley , chief of the federal bureau of home economics from 1923 to 1943 - drove the country &apos;s eating habits .
publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; budgeteers &quot; and rise to the challenge of transforming glop like creamed spaghetti with carrots into tasty dishes .
&quot; a square meal &quot; is a feast of historical tidbits .
especially savory are the accounts of the government &apos;s response to its hungry citizenry , like president herbert hoover &apos;s let-me-eat-cake attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple iowa farmhouse cooking of his childhood , he dined like the millionaire sophisticate he had become .
&quot; he liked to eat continental cuisine , like fish with cucumber sauce , &quot; mr. coe said .
he ate in almost a gold-plated dining room , wearing a dinner jacket .
he was fabulously out of touch .
president roosevelt may have committed the same error if his wife , eleanor , had not encouraged him to set an example with his stomach .
as the book tells it , mrs. roosevelt &apos;s hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in flavor resulted in a white house that &quot; put out not only some of the dreariest food in washington but also some of the most dismally prepared . &quot;
many of the depression-era food ways were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet .
the legacy is in our continued focus on calories and nutrition , ms. ziegelman said , and on the way science has been applied to cooking .
the couple said that in writing the book , they gained greater understanding of the eating habits of ms. ziegelman &apos;s mother - how she couldn &apos;t throw food away , for instance .
&quot; she had a real fear of food waste , &quot; mr. coe said .
ms. ziegelman recalled : &quot; she actually got people sick . &quot;
there was the cream-puff incident .
after the plates were cleared at eisenberg &apos;s , she and mr. coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home : the prune dessert that president roosevelt ate for lunch .
&quot; it &apos;s called prune whip , &quot; ms. ziegelman said , adding that a common trick was to give modest recipes a snazzy name .
there was no whipped cream , just prunes , a little bit of flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone reluctantly dipped a spoon into the viscous brown goo .
surprisingly , it wasn &apos;t bad .
mr. coe went back for seconds , and thirds .
sounding like a can-do budgeter , he told his wife , &quot; some chopped walnuts would help . &quot;

gilead to get attorney fees in hepatitis c patent fight with merck
gilead sciences inc is entitled to receive the attorney fees it incurred related to hepatitis c patent litigation with drugmaker merck &amp; co inc , a u.s. district judge has ruled .
in june , gilead was freed from paying up $ 200 million in damages for infringing two merck patents related to gilead &apos;s blockbuster drugs sovaldi and harvoni , after a u.s. judge found a pattern of misconduct by merck including lying under oath and other unethical practices .
in a filing on thursday , u.s. district judge beth labson freeman said that gilead was entitled to relief from the fees it incurred while defending the case .
merck is trying to catch up to gilead , which dominates the market on a new generation of hepatitis c drugs that can cure well over 90 percent of patients with the liver disease .
the case dates back to 2013 when gilead and merck sued each other , claiming ownership of laboratory work underlying sofosbuvir , the active ingredient in gilead &apos;s drugs .
u.s. backed forces say they have seized full control of manbij from islamic state
u.s.-backed forces have seized full control of northern city of manbij near the turkish border after the last remaining islamic state fighters inside the city left , a spokesman for the group said on friday .
syria democratic forces ( sdf ) were now sweeping the city after the departure of a remaining group of militants who had been holed up in the city .
they had freed over 2,000 civilian hostages who had been held by the militants , sharfan darwish of the sdf allied manbij military council told reuters .
&quot; the city is now fully under our control but we are undertaking sweeping operations , &quot; he told reuters .
clintons earned $ 10.75 million in 2015 , paid 34.2 percent federal tax rate
hillary clinton on friday released her 2015 tax returns , which showed the democratic presidential nominee and her husband had $ 10.75 million in income that year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent .
in 2015 , the clintons made $ 1 million in charitable contributions , mostly to the clinton foundation ; former president bill clinton brought in nearly $ 5.3 million in speaking fees ; and the former secretary of state reported income of $ 3 million from publisher simon &amp; schuster for her book on her tenure at the state department .
clinton &apos;s running mate , u.s. senator tim kaine of virginia , along with his wife , anne holton , released 10 years of tax returns .
they paid a federal effective tax rate of 20.3 percent in 2015 .
&quot; hillary clinton and tim kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency , &quot; clinton campaign aide jennifer palmieri said in a statement .
in stark contrast , donald trump is hiding behind fake excuses and backtracking on his previous promises to release his tax returns .
it is customary for u.s. presidential candidates to make their tax returns public , although they are not required by law to do so .
trump , a new york businessman , and his lawyers have cited an audit by the internal revenue service as a reason for his refusal to release his returns .
&quot; your move , &quot; clinton campaign aide ian sams said on twitter , linking to the democratic nominee &apos;s returns .
on thursday , trump &apos;s special counsel , michael cohen , told cnn he would not allow trump to release them until the audits are complete .
trump &apos;s critics , including 2012 republican presidential candidate mitt romney and other fellow republicans , have said his refusal raises questions about his net worth , his charitable contributions , his business dealings and various other ties , including with russia .
clinton has pounced on the issue , releasing an online video on friday highlighting high-profile republicans urging trump to release his taxes .
on thursday , she raised the issue during an economic speech in michigan .
&quot; he refuses to do what every other presidential candidate in decades has done and release his tax returns , &quot; she told the crowd .
politico has reported that trump paid zero to very little taxes for two years in the 1990s , and a new york times business columnist on friday quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants saying that could still be the case .
federal tax rates have become an issue in the presidential election .
clinton has endorsed a rule named after billionaire investor warren buffett that would ensure those making more than $ 1 million a year pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent .
president barack obama also backs the proposal .
at a clinton rally last week in omaha , nebraska , buffett , whose berkshire hathaway conglomerate is based there , challenged trump to meet and exchange tax returns .
buffet said that he too was under irs audit and trump is &quot; afraid &quot; not of the tax-collection agency but of voters .
clinton &apos;s campaign has released tax returns going back to 2007 .
the clintons , who now live in chappaqua , new york , paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40.5 percent .
the clintons &apos; 2015 return showed that , unlike most americans , just $ 100 of their income came from wages .
their main investment was a low-cost index mutual fund , and the clintons reported dividend and interest income of $ 109,000 .

the method has proved effective and honeyguide foundation , which hit upon the idea several years ago , with u.s.-based nature conservancy has stepped up its promotion , training volunteers in villages in north tanzania to use a non-violent four-step way of protecting their homes and crops without hurting the animals .
previously many used spears to defend themselves .
friday is world elephant day , which is dedicated to the protection of the animals .
&quot; since we developed the ... toolkit , we have seen an attitude change within these communities whereby they are much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming the elephants , &quot; honeyguide executive director damian bell said in a statement .
the first two steps involve shining a torch at the trespassing elephant and sounding a horn .
if it is not deterred , a so-called &quot; chilli cloud &quot; is thrown .
chilli powder mixed with soil is packed with a firecracker into a condom , its end is twisted shut with just the fuse exposed .
when lit , the condom bursts open with a bang , spraying a fine dust of chilli powder into the air .
one whiff is usually enough to send an elephant the other way .
a last resort is a launcher that shoots a roman candle firework into the air , producing a loud , bright explosion .
jewish filmmaker slams berlin hotel for removing israel dial code after arab &quot; request &quot; - rt news
a french filmmaker of jewish origin unleashed a media furor after he revealed that the kempinski bristol hotel in berlin does not list israel &apos;s dial code , with employee citing &quot; requests &quot; from arabic customers .
claude lanzmann , an author of holocaust documentary &quot; shoah , &quot; vented his frustration at the kempinski bristol hotel in berlin , writing an open letter in the german outlet faz .
during his recent stay , lanzmann tried to find israel in the list of dial codes provided by the hotel .
the country however was not mentioned among the states one can call directly from the room .
how is it possible , in 2016 in berlin , the capital of the new germany , that israel was eliminated and eradicated ?
lanzmann wrote .
instead , kempinski bristol offers an opportunity to dial israel via an own call center .
seeking explanation , the filmmaker addressed the issue at the hotel &apos;s reception .
the answer he got there , lanzmann wrote &quot; shocked him . &quot;
the hotel &apos;s clerk said that the measure was &quot; a deliberate decision by the management of kempinski-hotels . &quot;
the reason behind the move triggered even more outrage by the filmmaker .
&quot; the majority of our guests are arabs and they demanded israel &apos;s code to be deleted , &quot; the employee was quoted as saying by lanzmann .
israeli ambassador to germany yakov hadas-handelsman called the case a &quot; great shame , &quot; suddeutsche zeitung reports .
we were appalled and shocked by the incident .
it is in itself a great shame .
the fact that it has occurred in germany and at that very hotel chain , is an even greater disgrace .
that needs no explanation .
we expect that the hotel draws the right conclusions , &quot; the official said .
the incident triggered quite a response online , with people calling it a scandal .
some alleged that the kempinski hotel simply &quot; caved in &quot; to the alleged demands of arabic customers .
&quot; shame on you , &quot; another post stated , pointing out that the hotel , located in the noble kurfurstendamm street stands near a synagogue .
the hotel itself was quick to brush off any accusations , calling what happened an &quot; oversight &quot; and &quot; apologizing &quot; to lanzmann , der spiegel reports .
&quot; there was never a direct order &quot; not to include israel in the fast dial list , &quot; suddeutsche zeitung quoted a kempinski representative as saying .
it adds that the code was now added .
police use tear gas &amp; rubber bullets against protesting brazilian students
students clashed with police in the brazilian city of sao paulo on thursday as they gathered to demonstrate against government reforms to the public education system .
police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters .
the trouble started when law enforcement officers tried to disperse the students , which led to the police using rubber bullets and tear gas .
several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their dismay at the plans .
under proposals from the governor of the state of sao paulo geraldo alckmin , just under 100 public schools will be closed , while 300,000 students will be relocated in order to save money .
some of those taking part in the protest could be seen writing graffiti on the walls against the interim president michel temer .
this latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets en masse to support suspended president dilma rousseff as the country &apos;s senate voted for her impeachment .
trade between russia &amp; iran surges 71 % - rt business
with the lifting of sanctions , trade turnover between moscow and tehran has grown 70.9 percent in year-on-year terms , according to russia &apos;s ambassador to iran , levan dzhagaryan .
since international sanctions against iran were lifted , there has been a surge in interest from russian firms in doing business in the country , the ambassador said .
russian companies are resuming existing ties with iran , while new firms are ready to get access to the market .
of course , the further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of the bilateral cooperation with iran , &quot; dzhagaryan said .
he noted that in the first five months of 2016 the trade turnover between russia and iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period of 2015 and amounted to $ 856 million .
in particular , russian exports to iran jumped by 91.5 percent and amounted to $ 697 million .
russian imports from iran increased by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the boost in trade was achieved by supplies of machinery , ground vehicles and weapons , &quot; the ambassador said .
dzhagaryan is also expecting a record number of iranian tourists to visit russia this year .
last year , the russian diplomatic mission in iran issued about 35,000 visas , mostly travel , to iranian citizens .
in addition , for the first time iran entered the top 20 countries by number of tourists visiting russia .
it &apos;s safe to say that last year &apos;s record number of iranian tourists visiting russia will be broken , &quot; he said .
at the same time , relatively few russians are visiting iran , something the ambassador hopes will change .
&quot; i can personally recommend to visit the cities of isfahan , shiraz and yazd that have preserved monuments of ancient persian civilization in good condition , &quot; he said .
scot callum skinner storms home as brits grab cycling gold
scotland &apos;s callum skinner raced to glory in the men &apos;s team sprint at the rio velodrome last night as the team gb trio defended the title from london 2012 .
the glaswegian 23-year-old was in the anchor role that his fellow scotsman sir chris hoy made his own and the youngster did the legend proud as he stormed home to snatch victory from the favoured new zealand outfit .
britain claimed a shock victory four years ago to win as hoy claimed the fifth of his six olympic golds .
and they repeated the trick after finishing a lowly sixth at march &apos;s track world championships in london , despite hoy having since retired .
the issue between beijing and london was replacing specialist starter jamie staff .
they did so just in time as hindes emerged .
hoy &apos;s retirement also created a void which kian emadi and matt crampton tried to fill .
skinner was the man britain &apos;s coaches stuck with , seeing potential in the scot which has now been realised .
hindes , kenny - champions with hoy four years ago - and skinner set an olympic record in qualifying , but the standard was overtaken by new zealand in the first round .
and the british trio won the duel for gold .
hindes was narrowly behind after his lap , but kenny pushed the team in front and skinner held on .
a change of strategy was a big part of the transformation , with hindes riding a bigger gear to slow him down and allow kenny and , in particular , skinner to keep pace .
hoy watched on from his position as a bbc pundit and caught the eye of skinner , kenny and hindes when they stepped on to the podium .
the 23-year-old skinner , from glasgow , said : &quot; it &apos;s a flattering comparison . &quot;
i &apos;m just out there to do my best and make a name for myself .
we set an olympic record in the final and beat the world champions .
it was just incredible .
there &apos;s no better way to win it .
after triumphing at london 2012 alongside kenny and hoy , hindes admitted to deliberately falling to the track following a poor start .
he later retracted the comment and there was no method of appeal from britain &apos;s rivals .
there was no such issue this time around in a supreme victory .
hindes said : &quot; it felt like london , with all the gb flags in the stand . &quot;
we all as a team came together in the last three months .
we &apos;ve been losing out on so many world titles , so to win the olympics again is just amazing .
that is one event , one gold medal for the nation which won seven out of 10 track titles in both beijing and london .
if that is a barometer of the progress made in the last five months , then a successful five days in the velodrome awaits .
with the form kenny demonstrated , it is not beyond the realms of possibility to imagine him repeating hoy &apos;s feat of winning three olympic golds in one games .
that would see kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than hoy , who is also born on 23 march ( that seemingly sacred date in british sport which is also the birthday of steve redgrave , mo farah and roger bannister ) - take his tally to six gold medals and one silver .
that would be the same as hoy &apos;s .
kenny next competes in the sprint , which begins on today and plays out over three days .
the 28-year-old from bolton said : &quot; i &apos;m just enjoying this one for now .
the team event is always the best .
you get to win it with your mates .
it &apos;s a bit lonely winning on your own to be honest .
hindes said : &quot; if he wins another two gold medals , he should get a knighthood . &quot;
it was the day &apos;s only medal event , but there was further good news for britain .
sir bradley wiggins , ed clancy , steven burke and owain doull qualified fastest in the four-man , four-kilometres team pursuit .
they finished in 3 : 51.943 .
the world record , set in winning gold at london 2012 , is 3 : 51.659 .
the first round and final ( 10.42pm ) take place on today &apos;s second day of action , where wiggins is sure to be the focus .
he had a dispute with commissaires yesterday ahead of the qualification ride , when officials summoned him to measure his height .
in the corresponding women &apos;s event , which resumes and concludes tomorrow , laura trott , joanna rowsell shand , elinor barker and katie archibald of milngavie advanced in a world record time , clocking 4 : 13.260 .
team gb have come to rely on its mighty track cycling squad to take ownership of the middle period of an olympic games and deliver a host of medals .
after truly exceptional showings of utter dominance at beijing and london , expectations have been played down in the lead-up to rio .
there have been dramas in the background , not least the resignation of technical director shane sutton in april amid sexism and bullying allegations , and the retirements of giant figures like hoy and victoria pendleton .
however , on the evidence of the first night &apos;s racing in the velodrome , it looks like gb &apos;s now legendary reputation for peaking at the perfect time could be about to be repeated once again .
portland smelter &apos;s future in doubt with axing of power contract
the future of the portland aluminium smelter in victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is in doubt with the power company which supplies the plant disclosing one of the plant &apos;s owners is to terminate a supply contract , with all supply contracts expected to be axed .
the move follows the decision of the victoria government earlier this year to not extend subsidies provided to keep the plant in operation .
a 20-year fixed subsidy expires in november .
up to 2000 jobs may be at risk at alcoa &apos;s portland plant .
as many as 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk with any closure .
and there could be additional knock-on effects since the smelter consumes around 10 per cent of victoria &apos;s entire electricity output .
in 2014 , alcoa closed the point henry smelter which led to the closure last year of the anglesea power plant .
alcoa &apos;s portland smelter is losing money and risks closure .
the moves follows speculation about the future of the plant for several years now , initially in the wake of the strong australian dollar and more recently due to the price for the output from the plant .
agl , which supplies the big aluminium smelter with electricity from its loy yang a power plant in the latrobe valley , said it expects the other three owners will also move to terminate their agreements .
the plant is majority owned by a joint venture of alcoa and alumina , with china &apos;s citic and japan &apos;s marubeni corp holding smaller shares .
&quot; agl expects the portland facility to continue to operate , meaning physical demand for electricity from the smelter will continue , &quot; it said .
agl said the contracts are so-called &apos; hedging contracts &apos; which were due to take effect from november 2016 .
the contracts have a 12-month termination period so they will actually finish in 2017 .
&quot; as such , agl continues to expect the contracts to contribute to earnings in fiscal year 17 , &quot; the power company said .
any potential earnings impact on agl from fy18 onwards is currently limited by the strong futures market outlook for wholesale electricity prices .
agl said it had already written down the value of the contracts in its accounts by $ 187 million in &quot; anticipation of a termination event . &quot;
alcoa said the decision to close out the contracts &quot; does not affect alcoa &apos;s ... ability to operate the smelter or secure electricity supply to the smelter . &quot;
the us company said it entered into a 20-year contract with loy yang in 2010 , which was due to commence from november this year , although it has yet to explain why it has pulled out of the contract .
analysts have been wary of the possible closure of both of the portland smelter in victoria and also the tomago plant near newcastle due to the poor economics of the industry .
addressing analysts earlier in the week , agl &apos;s head of operations , stephen mikkelsen said portland uses around 600 megawatts of power annually and tomago around 900 megawatts .
if both of those plants go from the market that &apos;s a significant reduction in demand in the &#91; electricity &#93; market .
and as a generator that wouldn &apos;t be good for us , &quot; he said .
not just a kardashian reality tv star , kendall &apos;s on the cover of september &apos;s vogue
kendall jenner , 20 , model and fourth daughter of mother-manager kris &apos;s kardashian-jenner clan , is on the cover of us vogue &apos;s coveted september issue .
kendall , who is an estee lauder brand ambassador and has walked in milan , paris and new york fashion weeks , announced the news on her instagram account on thursday .
&quot; in a room with a bunch of people i love , looking at this cover made me cry , &quot; kendall wrote .
the cover revelation was followed by a bizarre ( or simply keeping up with the kardashians-esque ? ) , scripted reality video that featured the entire kardashian-jenner family ( bar troublemakers rob and caitlyn , and joined by everyone &apos;s favourite showbiz uncle , keeping up producer ryan seacrest ) forgetting about their sister &apos;s cover , only to end with the classic twist : they were all planning a surprise party .
it &apos;s the cliche plot line of nearly every &quot; birthday &quot; episode of a children &apos;s television show ( seacrest delivers the line , &quot; you thought we forgot about you ? , &quot; with the sincerity of a cartoon rabbit in an 8am timeslot ) , but kris had to get her other girls in on this publicity somehow .
because , with a spot on vogue &apos;s september issue , we have surely entered a new era of kardashian .
kendall &apos;s big sister kim may have beaten her to the cover of vogue ( she shared it with husband kanye west in april 2014 ) , but the magazine &apos;s september cover is a league unto itself .
the september issue is vogue &apos;s highest selling edition of the year .
with a thickness more closely resembling a coffee table book than a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a huge number of advertisers ( fashionista counted 615 of last year &apos;s 832-page tome as advertising content ) .
the revelation of its cover star is so hotly anticipated that , in the past two years , pictures of the magazine have been leaked before the official announcement .
previous women to feature on the cover include naomi campbell , linda evangelista and kate moss .
in recent years , the cover has certainly featured more &quot; celebrities who model &quot; than &quot; models who are celebrities . &quot;
oscar winner and dior ambassador jennifer lawrence was featured in 2013 , the year after lady gaga had the honour .
but , even on the off-chance that ms jenner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakout model &quot; of her generation - falls into the former category , she is in pretty good company .
these celebrities are not relatives of famous people , or reality stars , or kids these days who know how to make a good snapchat video ( although jenner is all of these things ) .
they are legitimately talented women , excelling in the entertainment industry .
beyonce , who appeared on last year &apos;s cover , has had one of the strongest years of her career with the release of lemonade .
of course , not everyone is pleased about jenner &apos;s success .
with her reality television history , jenner &apos;s position within the fashion world was always going to be fraught .
in june , original victoria &apos;s secret model stephanie seymour criticised jenner and her colleague gigi hadid , calling them the &quot; bitches of the moment . &quot;
this sentiment has boiled up again with the news of jenner &apos;s vogue cover appearance .
but dwelling on the discontent seems beside the point .
kendall jenner is on the cover of the september issue of vogue .
she is a supermodel , in the purest sense of the word .
she &apos;s walking for marc jacobs .
she &apos;s selling you estee lauder foundation .
she , and all of her sisters , are selling you pictures of themselves on their respective paywalled apps .
she &apos;s selling pictures of cindy crawford &apos;s daughter she photographed to love magazine .
and , in her downtime , possibly just as a way still to see sister kourtney and her kids , she &apos;s on reality television .
community legal centres turn away 160,000 people a year
more than 160,000 of the nation &apos;s most vulnerable are turned away from community legal centres every year , with the sector bracing itself for the impact further funding cuts will have on already-stretched operations .
in queensland , three out of five people - mostly the elderly , immigrants , vulnerable workers , victims of violence and those without resources to fight unfair evictions and the like - are already turned away while seeking free legal advice and representation .
community legal services , already stretched beyond limits , are bracing for further cuts .
from june next year , those legal centres are slated to lose another 30 per cent of their federal funding .
director of community legal centres queensland james farrell said the latest national association of community legal centres census report found thousands of people were already being turned away each year .
mr farrell said without a reversal of the federal government decision , the situation was only going to get worse .
&quot; queensland &apos;s community legal centres are chronically underfunded , meaning thousands of people are turned away from the vital services they need , &quot; he said .
people leaving violent relationships , people with unmanageable and crippling debts , families going through separation , workers who are unfairly sacked - all of these people have problems with legal dimensions , and this report shows that they &apos;re not able to get the help they need .
the federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from june 2017 , which means thousands more vulnerable queenslanders will be forced to navigate complex legal problems without help .
we call on the attorney-general , and queensland senator george brandis to immediately reverse these funding cuts , so people can get the help they need when they &apos;re faced with a legal problem .
last year , the state government delivered on its commitment to bring legal aid funding up to the national average .
it &apos;s now time to look at the needs of community legal centres and their client communities , and for the palaszczuk government to invest in this important work .
donald trump campaign sued after staffer allegedly pulled a gun
new york : donald trump &apos;s campaign was sued for allegedly doing nothing after being told that the director of its north carolina operations pulled a gun on a staffer as they drove in a jeep in february .
the incident was described in a lawsuit filed on wednesday in state court in charlotte by vincent bordini , a former software trainer for the state campaign .
bordini said he waited for months for the situation to be handled internally before realising &quot; this was not going to happen . &quot;
the director , earl phillip , &quot; produced a pistol , put his right index finger on the trigger , and drove the barrel into vincent &apos;s knee cap , &quot; bordini said in the complaint .
after complaining to local and regional campaign leadership , bordini learned that at least four other people had experience the same thing with phillip , according to the filing .
&quot; guns don &apos;t have to fire to inflict damage , &quot; bordini said in the complaint .
the suit comes just two days after the republican presidential nominee caused a furore when telling a crowd in north carolina that the &quot; second amendment people &quot; -- understood to be gun owners and gun enthusiasts -- could take action if his rival hillary clinton were elected and gets her pick of judges .
trump &apos;s campaign said the media had taken his words out of context and that he wasn &apos;t advocating violence .
bordini &apos;s complaint seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent supervision , and from phillip for assault , battery and infliction of emotional distress .
trump spokeswoman hope hicks didn &apos;t immediately return a message seeking comment .
attempts to reach phillip were unsuccessful .
wccb , a local news affiliate in charlotte , reported phillip recently left the campaign .
a call left at his consulting firm , innovative consulting services , wasn &apos;t immediately returned .
republican presidential candidate donald trump has run a controversial campaign .
the case is bordini v. donald j. trump for president inc . , 16-cs-14300 , general court of justice , superior court division county of mecklenburg ( charlotte ) .
britain must channel the olympic spirit and expand heathrow
heathrow will also deliver regeneration and prosperity not just in our local communities and across london , but across the country .
for me , this was the great attraction of heathrow , just as it was with london 2012 , where we made enormous efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the olympics achieved huge benefits for stratford and the east end .
and , we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and firms close to heathrow .
for our local communities alone we &apos;ll create 10,000 new apprenticeships , 40,000 new jobs and bring an end to youth unemployment around the airport .
just as there were ahead of london 2012 , there will be those that think the challenge of heathrow expansion is too great .
i was told that britain would be never be ready for the games and that we would be embarrassed on the world stage .
the doubters were wrong on 2012 and they will be proved wrong on heathrow .
there are always obstacles to be overcome , but heathrow is answering every question asked of it .
like the olympics , heathrow is an infrastructure project for the many , not just the few .
expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs , £ 211bn in economic growth , leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the uk .
we have a great team at heathrow who have implemented an £ 11bn programme of infrastructure investment on time and on budget , from t5 - voted the world &apos;s best airport terminal five years in a row , to t2 , built in the middle of the world &apos;s busiest two runways .
now they stand ready to deliver a third runway , backed by £ 16 billion of private investment .
the london 2012 games were a great success for the uk and i am confident that heathrow expansion will be too .
it is time for us to channel that olympic spirit and expand heathrow , securing our trading future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that britain can be proud of .
lord paul deighton is chairman of the heathrow board and former commercial secretary to the treasury
adblock plus , facebook in &quot; cat-and-mouse game &quot; over ad blocking
for companies that make money from online advertising , attempts to circumvent ad-blocking software amount to a &quot; cat-and-mouse game , &quot; according to one of the companies that makes that software .
on thursday , just two days after facebook announced it would be blocking ad blockers on its desktop site , adblock plus published a blog post saying that users could update their filters in its program to block ads on the social network once again .
on tuesday , facebook said that its desktop website would change the coding around its ads in order to make it more difficult for ad blockers to detect which parts of a page are ads .
but adblock now says it has gotten around the new codes .
in a blog post , adblock spokesperson ben williams wrote that &quot; this sort of back-and-forth battle between the open source ad-blocking community and circumventers has been going on since ad blocking was invented , &quot; and that it is possible facebook would come up with its own fix soon .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of just how big a concern ad blockers have become for the industry .
globally , roughly 200 million people use ad blockers , according to a study last year from pagefair and adobe ; nearly quadruple the number who used such software in 2013 .
with 1.03 billion daily active users accessing facebook via mobile devices , mobile advertising now accounts for 84 per cent of facebook &apos;s advertising revenue .
the company is going after ad blockers on desktop however , because mobile ad blockers are not effective in facebook &apos;s mobile apps for the social network and instagram , a spokesperson said .
desktop ads still account for enough revenue that facebook judged such a move to be worth the investment .
also on tuesday , facebook said it would be updating its &quot; ad preferences &quot; tool to give people more control over how ads are targeted to them .
on thursday facebook claimed that adblock &apos;s new filters were concerning because they would also block some non-advertising content on the site .
&quot; this isn &apos;t a good experience for people and we plan to address the issue , &quot; a facebook spokesperson said in an e-mailed statement .
ad blockers are a blunt instrument , which is why we &apos;ve instead focused on building tools like ad preferences to put control in people &apos;s hands .
woman run over on swiss motorway in apparent suicide
the victim was lying on the motorway in the middle of the night .
police are appealing for witnesses after a woman was run over by several vehicles on a motorway in the early hours of thursday in an apparent act of suicide .
the incident happened on the a1 near morges in the canton of vaud just after midnight on thursday .
a woman lay down in the dark on the road &quot; in a desperate act &quot; and was hit by several vehicles , vaud police said in a statement .
clearly looking to kill herself , the victim , a swiss woman aged 49 , was hit by several vehicles including a lorry .
she died at the scene .
several of the drivers involved have already been interviewed but some are still unidentified , said police , who are calling for them and anyone else who witnessed the incident to come forward .
a criminal investigation has been opened , a &quot; logical &quot; step in a situation like this , lawyer gilles hofstetter told le tribune de geneve .
however it remains to be seen if any of the drivers involved will face charges .
was it possible to avoid impact ?
that &apos;s what the prosecutor must determine , &quot; said hofstetter .
two other similar cases in the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible .
in each case - both of which involved a person walking on the motorway in the dark - it was judged that motorists cannot expect to come across a pedestrian on the motorway in the middle of the night , said the paper .
last year a police officer was acquitted of causing death by negligence after she hit and killed a man who was lying on the a1 near paynerne one night in august 2014 .
the 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had passed out on the road , the court heard .
the court found that the policewoman -- who was responding to an emergency call -- was driving in a manner that was justified and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; completely exceptional and unpredictable situation , &quot; the judge said .
anyone with information about thursday &apos;s incident near morges should call police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 .
a tolerant city .
prague is a popular destination for the lgbt community .
the association of czech travel agencies ( aČcka ) was expecting up to 20 thousand visitors to visit prague as part of prague pride ,
the executive director of aČcka kateřina petříčková said on friday .
the sixth edition of prague pride started on 8 august . the event celebrates the culture and lives of the lgbt community and its members .
last year the event attracted about 35,000 people .
&quot; thanks to the widespread tolerance and a range of specialised venues , prague is among the most popular destinations for the lgbt community , &quot; said petříčková .
according to a survey conducted by the organisers , the event &apos;s foreign visitors spend on average 3,100 czech crowns per person per day .
gay tourists have access to special maps of prague with a complete list of all gay and gay-friendly bars , clubs , coffee houses and restaurants in the form of mobile applications , etc .
&quot; as tourists , the lgbt clientele is very lucrative , because they enjoy luxury travel and high standard of travel services and they spend far more than anyone else &quot; , said ms petříčková .
we are also holding the first pride tourism symposium as part of the festival .
it serves as a platform for presentations by experts from the lgbt tourism sector from europe , usa and china .
the festival continues until sunday 14 august .
the main theme this year is love , but there are also several other thematic areas , such as family , aids prevention and transgender issues .
the highlight of the festival will be the traditional parade featuring floats , from václavské náměstí to letná .
over the past few years , thousands of people took part in the parade , which will hold one-minute silence this year in honour of the victims of the june attack at the nightclub in orlando , where an attacker shot and killed 49 people , mostly gay men .
pat and mat turn forty this year .
the die-hard handymen pat &amp; mat , who are synonymous with diy gone wrong , have been entertaining children and adults for forty years .
the pilot episode of the children &apos;s bedtime tv show premiered on 12 august 1976 .
the animated tv series , which has been aired in more than hundred countries around the world , was inspired by the cartoons about two handymen mr ouholíček and mr sedlec , which the artist and the series director lubomír beneš created for a magazine .
lubomír beneš then invited the dramaturg jiri kubicek and fellow artist vladimír jiránek to work with him and together they created the short film entitled kuťáci ( the tinkers ) .
they only got their current look featuring their signature yellow and red jumpers , beanie hat and a beret in 1979 when the authors started work on a new series for slovak television at krátký film studios in prague .
the characters &apos; names became pat and mat in 1985 , when the creators started shooting the series directly for krátký film praha .
in 1990 , lubomír beneš founded his own studio of animated films aif in prague and zurich where he created further episodes .
after his death in 1995 , further episodes were created by other makers , including beneš &apos;s son mark .
there are currently over ninety episodes with these clumsy handymen who are always good-natured and full of optimism , ideas and diy enthusiasm despite their mishaps . they are always happy with the results of their work , which they by making a signature and &quot; ... a je to ! &quot; &#91; &quot; ... and it &apos;s done ! &quot; &#93; .
pat and mat have even expanded their franchise from television screens to books , dvds and theatres and the characters or other toys featuring the image of pat and mat are among the most sought-after toys in any toy store .

the two-year british girl has an identical friend and she is happy .
what do people spend most of their money on at airports ?
this is a friday overview from the world &apos;s websites .
the first medal from the olympic games .
the island state of fiji is celebrating a historical success .
fiji &apos;s rugby team defeated in the final of the olympic sevens rugby tournament the team of great britain .
this is the first olympic gold medal ever won by fiji .
it took them sixty years from sending their first delegations to the olympic games .
the person most credited with fiji &apos;s success is the team manager ,
who happens to be somewhat ironically a brit , ben ryan .
he has been managing the team since 2013 and after the final , he had a reason to celebrate in contrast to his compatriots .
&quot; let &apos;s play freely and lightly and see if we can handle the biggest game in our history , &quot; said the manager before the final .
fiji eventually dominated the match , and the small island state with 900 thousand inhabitants is now experiencing an olympic fairy tale ,
as reported by the french daily le monde .
a new friend and good luck for a little girl .
two-year-old harmonie-rose ivy allen , who lost all her limbs when she was 11 months old has a new friend .
a doll that looks like her .
she just said , &quot; mummy , she &apos;s just like me , &quot; harmonie &apos;s mother told abc news .
&quot; she loves to take the arms and the legs off and they love to sit next to each other without the prosthetics on . &quot;
harmonie fell ill with meningitis b when she was 11 months old . the doctors only gave her 10 % chance of survival .
i love everything about her .
she is beautiful , smart , funny and never gives up .
she is quite upfront , too .
i have seen her introduce herself to another child by saying , &quot; i &apos;m harmonie and i have no hands &quot; .
see how happy the little girl is about her new friend .
on what do we spend most money at airports ?
according to cnn , people spend most money at airports for bottled water .
hudson &apos; s travel essential stores recently released a list of the top 10 items sold last year at airports .
beverages are king ,
taking eight of the 10 top slots .
the ninth place is occupied by m &amp; m peanut king-size with coconut flavour .
can you guess what is the last item on the top ten list ?
the only non-edible item .
according to cnn it is &quot; the wall street journal . &quot;
the other popular newspapers sold at airports include :
favourite magazines were &quot; us weekly , &quot; &quot; in touch , &quot; &quot; the economist . &quot;
rowing supremos .
we are just going to win , murray and bond said laughing .
the rowers eric murray and hamish bond from new zealand have dominated men &apos;s coxless pairs for seven years , and they reiterated their dominance at the olympics in rio de janeiro .
on the face of it , they looked like an odd couple when they both switched to a smaller crew after the beijing olympics . since 2009 , they have completely obliterated their competition .
in thursday &apos;s finale they have recorded their 69th win in a row on the rodrigo de freitas lagoon .
what do we do differently from other crews ?
we are simply better looking , joked murray during the olympic regatta when he had to answer questions about the dominance of the new zealand pair .
honestly , we don &apos;t do a hell of a lot differently .
we train hard , really hard ,
and just constantly try to refine our technique , that is our philosophy , murray said on a more serious note .
their domination is also remarkable given their different physique .
while murray is almost two meters tall and weighs 100 kilos , bond is five centimetres shorter and 15 kilos lighter .
moreover , they have completely different personalities -
bond is studying finance , and murray has been involved i.a. in a charity boxing match .
this is likely the reason why they do not spend much time together outside rowing .
eric gets in the boat with the attitude that we cannot lose .
we are just going to win .
i have a tendency to think about what might go wrong , bond admitted who clearly demonstrated during the press conference that murray had the more dominant personality of the two .
it was murray who answered the questions first , while bond waited his turn .
on the water , they are destroying their competition with their quiet strength .
they keep the pace from the start , and even though they often do not lead the race at the halfway mark , they gradually go faster - nobody else can do that .
we race on a two kilometre stretch of water , and we never want to test our limits during the first kilometre of the race .
all we do is to try and race at a pace nobody else can keep up with .
we know what we have to do to win , said the thirty-four-year-old murray .
together with his four years younger partner , he won seven gold medals at the world championships .
they also triumphed in 2007 , when they were part of the men &apos;s four without coxswain .
following an unexpected defeat of the bigger crew at the beijing olympics , murray and bond decided to break out into a pair .
at the olympic games in london , they avenged the biggest defeat of their career , and they reiterated their supremacy in rio .
london was very intense .
we did everything our coach told us . no questions asked .
this time it was more enjoyable .
we knew it would be very hard , and we had to make sure that we are mentally strong .
we know that everyone wants to knock us from our number one position .
we walk around with the target on our backs .
that is why we try to be a step ahead of the competition , he added .
nasa climate model : venus was once habitable
venus was likely once habitable , according to the projections of a new nasa climate model .
scientists at nasa &apos;s goddard institute for space studies developed a model to explore venus &apos; past using tools and algorithms similar to those employed by climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine whether or not venus , with its hot , water-less surface and co2-chocked atmosphere , might have once hosted earth-like conditions .
scientists have previously suggested that venus &apos; slow rotation rate is explained by its thick atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggests venus could have boasted a thin , earth-like atmosphere and still spun slowly .
the model also looked at the topography of early venus .
the planet likely featured more dry regions than earth , but once had enough water and geographical variability to host life and guard against rapid evaporation .
early venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent dimmer .
&quot; in the giss model &apos;s simulation , venus &apos; slow spin exposes its dayside to the sun for almost two months at a time , &quot; giss scientist anthony del genio explained in a news release .
this warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heating .
the result is mean climate temperatures that are actually a few degrees cooler than earth &apos;s today .
the model produced a story of venus similar to the evolution previously hypothesized by planetary scientists .
though likely once habitable , venus was -- over the course of several billion years -- exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light .
its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light .
as its hydrogen escaped , all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deathly greenhouse gas effect -- thus , the venus we know today .
researchers shared the results of their new venus climate model in the journal geophysical research letters .
patrick roy resigns as avalanche coach
patrick roy resigned as coach and vice president of the hockey operations of the colorado avalanche on thursday , citing a lack of a voice within the team &apos;s decision-making process .
colorado executive vice president / general manager joe sakic confirmed the move and noted that the club will begin a search for a new coach immediately .
&quot; for the past three years , i have carried out my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the colorado avalanche with energy , passion and determination , &quot; the 50-year-old roy said in the statement .
i have thought long and hard over the course of the summer about how i might improve this team to give it the depth it needs and bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the vision of the coach and vp-hockey operations needs to be perfectly aligned with that of the organization .
he must also have a say in the decisions that impact the team &apos;s performance .
these conditions are not currently met .
sakic , who hired roy on may 23 , 2013 , thanked roy for his contributions to the team .
&quot; patrick informed me of his decision today , &quot; sakic said .
we appreciate all he has done for our organization and wish him the best of luck in the future .
roy was named the jack adams award winner as the league &apos;s best coach during his rookie season with the avalanche in 2013-14 .
he guided the club to 112 points and a first-place finish in the central division , but colorado was upset by minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and has missed the postseason in each of the last two years .
the avalanche posted a 39-39-4 mark in 2015-16 and fell five points shy of the wild for the second wild-card spot in the western conference .
a hall of fame goaltender , roy won four stanley cups -- two apiece with the montreal canadiens and the avalanche .
north sea oil workers resume talks , suspend strike
labor strikes over pay for north sea oil workers are suspended while all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks , lead negotiators said .
strikes against oilfield services company wood group have been staged sporadically on platforms in the north sea operated by royal dutch shell .
&quot; wood group and the unite and rmt unions can confirm we have agreed to restart the process for resolution of the current dispute , &quot; a joint statement read .
we will hold a number of full-day meetings over the next few weeks , starting early next week , to take a fresh look at the issues .
the labor unions said their recent action , which they said is the first in more than 25 years , was in protest of potential pay cuts of up to 30 percent .
wood group this year cut rates paid to its north sea contractors by about 9 percent because of negative market pressures .
the company &apos;s rate reduction follows a 10 percent decrease for onshore contractors in 2014 .
the company said additional cuts would give the company the room needed to move through the market downturn .
shell , for its part , has trimmed thousands of people from its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations in the wake of its mega-merger with british energy company bg group .
energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices , an economic situation compounded by the british decision in june to leave the european union .
scottish member of parliament dave anderson met with labor leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes to strike the north sea in a generation .
the north sea , he said , is vital for the regional economy .
&quot; in the north sea and right across the country , we need an economy that works for the many and not just the few , &quot; he said in a statement .
less than $ 1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the north sea is expected in 2016 , compared with an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
kepler measures spin rates of stars in pleiades cluster
the latest mission by the kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of spin rates among the stars of the pleiades cluster .
the new data is helping astronomers understand why stars in the cluster spin at varying rates , as well as how rotation periods relate to planet formation .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results to other star clusters , we will learn more about the relationship between a star &apos;s mass , its age , and even the history of its solar system , &quot; luisa rebull , a research scientist at caltech &apos;s infrared processing and analysis center in pasadena , said in a news release .
the pleiades cluster is situated 445 light-years from earth .
many of the stars in the cluster are just now reaching adulthood , having been born roughly 125 million years ago .
they &apos;re spinning as fast as they ever will .
at their peak spin rates , these maturing stars eject large amounts of stellar wind .
as these winds travel across the stars &apos; magnetic fields , they enact a braking effect on the stars .
as a star ages , its spin rate begins to slow down .
kepler measures each star &apos;s spin rate by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable starspots -- like sunspots .
the latest catalog of spin rates suggests more massive stars spin more slowly than less massive stars .
rebull likens the stars to dancers , larger ones pirouetting more slowly than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &apos; ballet &apos; of the pleiades , we see that slow rotators tend to be more massive , whereas the fastest rotators tend to be very light stars , &quot; said rebull .
because the pleiades cluster is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities with spin rates .
&quot; the pleiades star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation going both directions , younger and older , &quot; said rebull .
we still have a lot we want to learn about how , when and why stars slow their spin rates and hang up their &apos; dance shoes , &apos; so to speak .
rebull and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of pleiades spin rates in three new papers , soon to be published in the astronomical journal .
is a qualification agreement necessary ?
if i did not register , there would not be a qualification agreement . does this mean that i could move to a different hospital after a few months ?
is it even possible to work after completing the course without having to register with a specialised training programme ?
i am asking because there is an opening in the field i would like to work in . the only problem is that the hospital is far away . there may be another opening in six months in a hospital much closer to me where i would like to work .
i do not know how to handle the situation during the six months or so , the asker continued .
the question is answered by mgr . lenka vlková .
you are not required under any law to sign a qualification agreement with an employer - hospital .
qualification agreement is a legal concept which is governed by the labour code , and may be concluded between the employee and the employer to recover costs associated with upgrading the skills and enhancing the employee &apos;s qualifications .
in the healthcare sector , there has been a long-term pushback against these agreements to ensure the mobility of health workers and not all hospitals currently require this agreement .
act no 95 / 2004 coll . , on the conditions of obtaining and recognizing professional qualifications and specialised qualifications for the medical profession of doctor , dentist , pharmacist , as amended , specifically states that participation in specialised training is considered to be an enhancement of qualification ( rather than an upgrade ) .
this means that under the labour code , a qualification agreement can only be concluded if the costs reach at least czk 75,000 .
there is also no obligation under the law to apply for specialised training .
the law only stipulates the application requirements for being included in specialisation training .
the doctor is , however , entitled by law to practice medicine alone on the basis of completing the relevant university studies under the conditions stipulated by law ( under the expert supervision of a doctor with specialist qualifications in the relevant field ) .
the law foresees a situation where professional experience in another field of specialisation can count towards specialised medical training of the doctor in question , if its content and scope relate to the relevant educational programme .
in theory , it should be possible to include time worked elsewhere , which is the case here .
given that i do not know the details of this case , i would recommend a consultation with the relevant department of the ministry of health ( department of science and medical professions ) , because the ministry of health is required by law to provide advisory and consultancy services relating to the specialist training and its structure .
free advice is also offered by the czech medical chamber , the membership of which is compulsory for all medical professionals .
aleppo doctors appeal to the us to intervene .
&quot; we have seen no effort on behalf of the united states to lift the siege ( of the rebel-held part of the city by government forces ) or even use its influence to push the parties to protect civilians , &quot; said the letter addressed to the white house according to the afp news agency .
&quot; we do not need tears or sympathy or even prayers ; what we desperately need is a no-fly zone over eastern aleppo to stop the attacks , and we need international action to prevent aleppo from being again surrounded , &quot; said the doctor .
russian forces which support the army loyal to president bashar al-assad , announced that from today , military hostilities in aleppo will stop for three hours every day to allow humanitarian convoys safe passage .
all military activity , including air strikes and artillery fire is supposed to stop from 9 : 00 to 12 : 00 cest .
the un emergency relief coordinator , stephen o &apos;brien welcomed the initiative , but stressed that what is needed is at least a two-day truce .
according to afp , the letter to obama was signed by 15 of the 35 doctors working in the rebel-controlled eastern part aleppo .
they wrote that for five years , they witnessed the violent , cruel deaths of countless patients , friends and colleagues .
the world has stood by and remarked how complicated syria was , while doing little to protect us .
recent offers of evacuation form the regime and russia had sounded like thinly-veiled threats , said the surgeons paediatricians and other doctors .
doctors said that last month , there were 42 attacks on medical facilities in syria , 15 of which were hospitals in which they work .
what pains us most , as doctors , is choosing who will live and who will die .
young children are sometimes brought into our emergency rooms so badly injured that we have to prioritise those with better chances ,
or simply do not have the equipment to help them , said the doctors .
two weeks ago , four newborn babies , gasping for air suffocated to death after a blast cut the oxygen supply to their incubators .
gasping for air , their lives ended before they had really begun .
in recent weeks , forces loyal to bashar al-assad supported by russian forces have seized control of the rebel-held east aleppo with over 200,000 people still trapped inside with no food supplies .
the rebels , who are under constant attack by russian and syrian air force , managed to break through the siege on saturday and launch a counteroffensive .
both sides have added reinforcements both in the city and the surrounding areas .
