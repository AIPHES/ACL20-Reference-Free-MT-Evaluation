in june 2016 , the size of italy &apos;s national debt exceeded 2.248 trillion euros .
the country &apos;s central bank stated that this number represents a historic high , ria novosti reports .
the previous unfavourable record was set in may of this year .
at that time , the size of the national debt had reached 2.228 trillion euros .
it is noted that , over the first six months of the year , italy &apos;s debt load grew by 77.2 billion euros .

scientists have discovered an animal that can live for 500 years
an international team of biologists have come to the conclusion that the longest-living vertebrate is the greenland shark , which can live for approximately 500 years , rt reports .
scientists conducted radiocarbon analysis of the eye lenses of 28 greenland sharks .
the largest shark , with a length exceeding five metres , could be between 272 and 512 years old .
the biologists believe that a slow metabolism , which results in slower development , plays an important role in the shark &apos;s longevity .
female greenland sharks only reach sexual maturity by the age of 150 .
previously , it was thought that the longest living of all the vertebrates was the shark &apos;s ‘ neighbour ’ : the greenland whale .
the oldest such specimen known to scientists was slightly older than 210 years .
putin changed the composition of the security council of the russian federation .

deputy secretary of the council , rashid nurgaliyev , was excluded from the list of permanent members of the security council of the russian federation .
sergei ivanov , anton vaino , presidential plenipotentiary to the siberian federal district , sergei menyailo , and plenipotentiary to the northwestern federal district , nikolai tsukanov , were included on the council .
sergei ivanov is relieved of the post of chief of staff of the presidential executive office .

is it worth going to a health resort if you don &apos;t have any health problems ?
our expert : head doctor of a health resort , olga bogush .
if a person is healthy , but just burnt-out from work , should they bother going to a health resort ?
a health resort vacation is essential to us not only in terms of treatment , but also for the prevention of illnesses .
in the setting of a health resort , a person can check the state of their body and receive recommendations from a doctor about how to live so that their health does not fall apart .
these types of recommendations are useful to everyone .
‘ i &apos;m just burnt-out from work ’ , is an important signal from the body that shouldn &apos;t be dismissed .
constant stress and mental and physical exhaustion can lead to depression and chronic fatigue syndrome .
but about 90 % of visitors feel stressed .
moreover , the people who are most susceptible to it are from large cities and between the ages of 45 and 55 .
so , it &apos;s best to not compound matters and give yourself time to relax before it ’ s too late .
studies show that 98 % of people lower their biological age during a stay at a health resort .
modern health resorts offer a comfortable stay for the whole family .
so , if you want to spend your vacation with the children , you won &apos;t have to part ways with them .
wellness programmes are available for children , even the very youngest , which include not only diagnostic services , consultations with a paediatrician , and tests , but also therapeutic services .
for example : swimming ( there are children &apos;s pools at many health resorts ) , inhalation therapy , specialised dietary regimes , massage , oxygen cocktails , and physiotherapy .
a doctor determines a course of treatment taking into account patient-specific indications and the particular characteristics of the growing body .
in addition , health resorts usually offer a children &apos;s club with activity coordinators , where children can explore play activities and various workshops .
some health resorts even open their doors to guests with infants , providing babies with the necessary conditions and offering the services of an experienced nanny .
mild winters , long summers , and an abundance of sunny days each year ( more than 300 ) create the perfect conditions for year-round recreation at the resorts of the caucasian mineral waters .
after all , the body needs rest not only during the summertime .
so , there &apos;s no need to fear the weather outside , especially since the majority of procedures are conducted indoors and are in no way dependant on the season .
in general , it is advisable to undergo treatment at a health resort 2 times a year , especially for people of a mature age .
the main draw of the caucasian mineral waters region is , of course , its healing mineral springs : slavyanovsky , smirnovsky , yessentuki , and narzan .
their waters possess unique properties and act on different systems of the body .
the water differs in terms of temperature , the amount of salt , total mineralisation , and chemical and gas composition .
a doctor chooses the water depending on the patient ’ s wellbeing .
for example , narzan has anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects , and repairs the function of the gastrointestinal tract and the metabolism .
yessentuki-4 affects the gastrointestinal tract and reduces blood sugar levels .
new yessentuki offers anti-inflammatory , choleretic , and diuretic effects .
the water at slavyanovsky has the same effect .
when prescribing water treatment , the doctor must take into account the condition of the cardiovascular system .
if there are signs of hypertension , they choose water with a lower salt content , because the salts retain liquid , which leads to increased blood pressure .
the consumption of mineral water requires adherence to a regime : the water should be drunk at a particular time , in a required amount , and at a specific temperature .
nowadays , various cosmetic procedures for the face and body are also available at health resorts .
what kinds of health treatments , based on the natural features of the north caucasus , are available at resorts in the region ?
near pyatigorsk , for example , there is the tambukan salt lake , the silt mud from which is beneficial for the joints , spine , and internal organs .
it offers anti-inflammatory , resolving , and immunomodulatory effects .
then there are constitutional walks along individually tailored routes .
they are especially popular in kislovodsk , where there is the huge resort park ( the second largest in europe ) .
they are popular in kislovodsk , which is located in close proximity to the narzan mineral spring .
there , you can also take baths in wine , pearls , iodine-bromine , selenium , and sage-liquorice , depending on what the doctor prescribes for you .
extending the fruiting period .
what can be done to make the harvest last until the end of the season ?
yuliya belopukhova , an agronomist and dacha dweller , explains .
it &apos;s time to give those tall tomato plants a trim : remove the new shoots , cut off the top of the plant , and remove all the leaves up to the second-to-last cluster with fruit and blossoms with small young fruit – they won &apos;t have time to ripen .
we top-dress all tomatoes , regardless of their ‘ type ’ , as well as peppers and eggplant , with an ash-superphosphate extract and treat them with biologicals ( dozrevatel , to speed up the ripening and growth of the fruit ; fitosporin-m , fitolavin , gamair , baktofit , to ward off diseases ; immunotsitofit , to strengthen immunity ; and bitoxybacillin , lepidocide , fitoverm , if there are pests ) .
at the end of summer , the only chemical products that should be used are copper sulphate , colloidal sulphur , and insecticidal soap .
we do the final watering of the plants .
in the greenhouse , we lower the long climbing cucumbers from the trellis so that the lower bare part of the stem ( 25-40 cm ) is laying on the ground , then we water it with a warm water and zircon solution , and cover the stem in 5-7 cm of compost .
extending the fruiting period of squash is also easy : cut off the old leaves , water it with warm water and a multinutrient fertiliser solution , and add some nutrient-rich soil under the bush .
to protect against night-time cold , drape material over the garden bed .
keep the plants uncovered during the day , but cover them after sunset .
signs of the end .
what indicates that russia is emerging from the crisis ?
economists have seen signs that russia is emerging from the longest recession of the past twenty years .
as noted by the analysts surveyed by bloomberg , russia &apos;s gdp is showing improvement : in the second quarter , gdp declined by 0.8 % in annual terms .
this figure represents the smallest decline since the beginning of 2015 .
according to the latest data from rosstat , russia &apos;s economic contraction slowed to 0.6 % in the second quarter .
the central bank and the ministry of economic development and trade also recently spoke about the stabilising situation .
slow growth ahead .
according to experts from the central bank of russia , the russian economic recession is a thing of the past .
‘ the index rating of russia &apos;s gdp indicates that the recession is behind us , and that slow economic growth is ahead ’ , says a bulletin from the bank of russia called ‘ what the trends indicate ’ .
experts from the regulatory authority increased the gdp estimate model for the current quarter to 0.4 % , while the estimate for the fourth quarter is 0.5 % .
a spokesperson for the ministry of economic development and trade reported that russia &apos;s gdp stopped contracting in the second quarter , amounting to 0.2 % .
in the second quarter , the seasonally adjusted decline in gdp amounted to 0.2 % compared to the previous quarter .
but over the course of the quarter , the decline stopped : it amounted to 0.2 % in april , while in may and june , the change in gdp was within the range of 0-0.15 % ’ , ria novosti quotes the spokesperson from the ministry of economic development and trade as saying .
the slowdown in the rate of contraction of the russian economy over the past five quarters suggests that the ‘ bottom has already been passed ’ .
bloomberg names the growth in demand for electricity and rail transport , as well as the revival of business among other markers that point to signs of recovery in the national economy .
if you take into account the fact that it &apos;s a leap year , it is clear that the trend of a 1 % increase in the consumption of electricity can be partially attributed to the additional workday .
then , we &apos;ll factor in the colder than average annual temperatures in the first quarter .
the next argument is the increase in freight traffic , but here it &apos;s difficult to obtain accurate data , and an increase or decrease of 0.5 % in semi-annual volume could also be explained by seasonal factors ’ , explains kirill yakovenko from alor broker .
on the other hand , there are other more obvious signs of stabilisation of the russian economy .
for example , a decline in price pressure .
in july , the consumer price index amounted to 7.2 % , compared to 15.6 % for the same month last year .
moreover , rosstat has recorded deflation over the past two weeks .
prices in russia have fallen for the first time in five years .
if you look at the dynamic of the rouble exchange rate , despite displaying high volatility at the beginning of the year , it strengthened by 12 % between the beginning of the year and august .
this is also one of the signs of recovery , which indicators in the real economy should follow ’ , underscores yakovenko .
in addition to this , since april , there has been growth in the volume of industrial output in the russian federation .
in june , this figure rose by 1.7 % .
the rate of decline in foreign trade turnover has slowed from -32.8 % in january 2016 , to -20.7 % in may .
a positive trend is also evident in the labour market , where the rate of unemployment fell to 5.4 % .
the only time it has been lower was in september 2015 ( 5.2 % ) .
in spite of the favourable situation in the labour market , the issue of real disposable incomes leaves a lot to be desired .
in annual terms , this figure has declined by 4.8 % .
this factor could slow down the economic recovery , given that household spending represents a sizeable contribution to gdp .
as a rule , its share in the structure of the economy exceeds 50 % .
in addition to weak consumption , the bank of russia &apos;s strict policy could also be mentioned in terms of other risk factors for economic growth .
the regulatory authority has held rates at 10.5 % , which doesn &apos;t have the best impact on the real sector .
inadequate levels of investment are also a negative factor , as this hinders development of industrial capacity .
overall , however , we can assume that by the end of the year , the rate of decline in the russian economy will slow to -0.5 % , compared to -3.7 % in 2015 ’ , says irina rogova , an analyst with forex club .
the process of naturalisation of athletes , which has recently taken-off in russian football and was well established in the winter sports at the olympics in sochi , is still not as extensively developed in summer sports .
if former foreigners are also competing for russia at the olympic games in rio , then in the majority of cases , we are talking about natives of countries that were former republics of the soviet union .
however , in rio de janeiro , we can observe the reverse process : a sufficiently large number of russians are competing under the flags of other states .
in each case , the story behind the change of nationality is different .
some were brought to a different country by their parents during childhood , leaving no choice .
some couldn &apos;t successfully compete for a spot on the russian team .
while some thought that there would be better conditions to improve in their sport abroad .
aif.ru found at least 16 athletes who decided to change their russian citizenship .
in the german passport of the 27-year-old girl , it is written that her name is lisa ryzih .
previously , however , it was , of course , elizaveta .
she was born in 1988 , in the city of omsk .
just four years later , as soon as the soviet union collapsed , lisa &apos;s parents decided to immigrate to germany .
the young girl didn &apos;t have a choice .
there , she decided to follow in the footsteps of her older sister and pursue track and field .
just like her sister , lisa chose pole vaulting .
if she had stayed in russia , it is doubtful she could have ‘ usurped the thrown ’ of yelena isinbayeva .
unfortunately , at the olympics in rio , lisa will be the only one of our countrywomen , even if only a former one , in the pole vault event .
her highest achievements in this sport are bronze at the 2010 european championships and silver at the continental competition in 2016 , which she won , once again , amidst yelena isinbayeva &apos;s absence .
29-year-old elena pirozhkova was born in novokuznetsk in 1986 .
her parents are religious proselytisers of an evangelical branch .
for the most part , they left for the united states , because of their religion , when the young girl was just three years old .
in addition to elena , there were eight other children in the family .
they all lived in the small town of greenfield , massachusetts .
lena already started to get involved in wrestling in school .
producing good results , she moved to the city of colorado springs , where she continued to practice at the us training centre for wrestling , under the guidance of another former russian citizen , vladislav izboinikov .
at the 2012 olympics in london , elena lost in her very first fight .
but then , at the world championships that same year , she had a victory .
prior to this , in fact , she managed to win silver at the world championships in 2010 .
after this , there was a bronze in 2013 and a silver in 2014 .
26-year-old maria was born in the city of yaroslavl , where she first became acquainted with synchronised swimming .
however , it wouldn &apos;t be right to say that our coaches in russia trained her .
soon afterwards , the girl &apos;s family decided to immigrate to the united states and settle down in the city of colorado .
maria continued her training there .
soon thereafter , she joined the us team and made an excellent showing at the pan american games .
of course , she couldn &apos;t compete at the intensive international level of russian synchronised swimming , but for america , her results were at the very top .
kristen shaldybin , which sounds odd in russian , received her new name at 11 years of age , when her parents decided to continue the girl &apos;s training in rhythmic gymnastics overseas .
up to that point , the girl was engaged in her favourite sport in her native yaroslavl .
having immigrated to the united states , she quickly joined that country &apos;s youth team , and later also pushed her way into the main national team .
at the pan american games , 19-year-old kristen won gold and silver .
of course , she wasn &apos;t in contention for first place on the world stage , but she staged a real breakthrough for the united states , taking the team of stars and stripes into the olympic games in rio de janeiro .
another one of our former ‘ rhythmic gymnasts ’ is jana berezko-marggrander , who competes for team germany .
jana was born in tolyatti .
in 2008 , when the girl was only 13 years old , the family decided to move to germany : there , the girl had a better chance of making it onto the national team .
it didn &apos;t take long before she was representing her country at the 2012 olympic games in london .
there , however , jana was only able to take 17th place , which was not enough to get into the final competition in the individual event .
on the other hand , in the two years prior to this , she , in fact , managed to win a bronze medal at the youth olympic games .
there is another gymnast , but this time , an artistic gymnast : irina sazonova .
if the immigration route of the already-mentioned gymnasts could be called conventional , then the choice of irina &apos;s family was very unusual : iceland .
ira is an alumna of a volgograd sport school .
naturally , in iceland , she immediately became national champion .
truth be told , ira still trains in russia : she comes home specifically so that she doesn &apos;t lose her skills .
in rio , she didn &apos;t perform as well as she would have liked .
her best placing was 40th in the individual all-around .
there is extremely little information about the swimmer , maria ugolkova , in the russian infosphere .
maria has been living and training in switzerland for a very long time .
however , for quite a long time , she was competing under the russian flag and producing some decent results : there was even a national record in the 200 metre butterfly .
in 2015 , she received swiss citizenship and started competing under the red and white flag .
in rio , her best performance was 14th place in the 4x100 m freestyle relay .
in order to get to the games , the girl started a crowdfunding project , through which she managed to collect around 6,000 francs , which enabled her to pay for her preparations for the olympics .
31-year-old freestyle wrestler , adam batirov , spent virtually his entire career under the russian flag .
during that time , the native of khasavyurt managed to become a three-time winner of the european championships , russian champion , and an international class master of sports of russia .
when he stopped making it onto our national team , the time had come to start thinking about changing nationality .
for several years , the talented fighter disappeared from the sporting podium .
his triumphant comeback happened at the 2016 asian championships : batirov was already representing bahrain , for whom he won a gold medal and got a ticket to the olympics in rio .
back home , there is even less known about another ex-russian , mikhail kudinov , than about swiss swimmer , maria ugolkova .
the fact of the matter is that his parents emigrated from vladivostok to new zealand when the boy was very young .
it is there that mikhail started to get involved in artistic gymnastics .
he didn &apos;t achieve great success at the international level .
in rio , his best performance was 40th place in the qualification round on the parallel bars .
but for new zealand , even getting to the olympics in artistic gymnastics is already a breakthrough .
when nastya , who was born in moscow in 1985 , was just 9 years old , her family immigrated to israel .
there , the girl continued to train in synchronised swimming , performing very well at the national level .
in 2014 , at the european championships in berlin , the girl took 6th place in synchronised swimming .
in a duet with evgenia tetelbaum , anastasia took eighth place .
she was fifth in the solo programme .
just like anastasia , 23-year-old dmitry kroyter competes for team israel .
when the boy was just 6 years old , his mother decided to repatriate to israel .
in 2009 , at the age of 17 , dmitry had already become national champion .
in the same year , he won the world youth championship .
a year later , kroyter also won gold at the youth olympic games in singapore .
in addition to high jump , dmitry also does long jump and triple jump .
31-year-old albert is another native of khasavyurt , who , after a long time of competing for russia , decided to switch his sport nationality .
however , unlike batirov , albert chose romania , whom he will also represent in rio .
in russia , he competed for the school of higher sports mastery in krasnoyarsk , and , in 2011 , even became national champion .
28-year-old oleg antonov was born in moscow into the family of a member of the ussr &apos;s volleyball team , yaroslav antonov .
just a year before the birth of his son , yaroslav was recognised as the best volleyball player on the planet .
soon thereafter , he decided to continue his career in italy .
there , the family remained as permanent residents .
in 2015 , as a part of the national team , he became the bronze medal winner at the european championships , which were held in his new homeland .
khadjiev was born in chechnya in 1994 , and got stuck with his family in the midst of the war .
after ten years , his parents decided to emigrate .
the original goal was norway , but it wasn &apos;t possible to get into this northern country , and they had to go to france , to nice .
there , zelimkhan continued to study freestyle wrestling .
soon thereafter , he won the junior world championship , and later qualified to participate in the olympic games .
in rio , he will be the only representative for france in the wrestling tournament .
and once again it &apos;s freestyle wrestling , and once again it &apos;s a former russian citizen .
but this time , the story is about a native of north ossetia who immigrated to spain : it &apos;s about taimuraz friev .
at the end of december 2012 , he was granted spanish citizenship and , currently , he competes for this country &apos;s national team .
before this , of course , the 30-year-old athlete also managed to produce very good results in russia .
he became the bronze medal winner at the national championships in 2007 and 2008 .
tired of not making it onto the team , taimuraz decided to change sports nationality .
the last on our list is a chechen boxer , arthur biyarslanov , born in the capital of dagestan , makhachkala , in 1995 .
when the boy was ten years old , his parents took the family through azerbaijan to canada .
there , arthur , on the advice of his older brother , started to box .
since then , arthur has become canadian champion three times over , and , in 2012 , he became the world youth champion .
in 2015 , biyarslanov won gold at the pan american games , the first for his new homeland since 1975 .
the chief of staff of the executive office of the president of the russian federation is aton vaino .
on friday , 12 august , vladimir putin appointed anton vaino as chief of staff of the executive office of the president of russia .
previously , sergei ivanov held this post .

why should the children of cossacks have classes at schools ?
according to governor v. kondratyev , &apos; cossacks need to be educated not with campaigns and parades , but in a systematic manner &apos; .
they should grow up and , at the very least , from the age of 7 , understand that they are cossacks and their education should be cossack .
but so far this work , it seems to me , is being carried out as a mere formality , and , i suspect , primarily just on paper .
if cossack classes incorporate everything positive that has been previously accumulated and take it to a whole new level , then i will be pleased .
if everything is done in a hurry and without knowing how to go about it , then this new idea will result in cheap populism .
housing and communal services continue to be one of the most criminal sectors of the country &apos;s economy .
there is evidence of misappropriation of funds that are earmarked for public utilities from budgets at various levels .
according to the prosecutor general &apos;s office , artificially high prices are one of the most common crimes in the sphere of housing and communal services .
as a result , consumers in the region overpaid power suppliers by more than 170 million roubles .
the other day , the prosecutor &apos;s office for krasnodar krai also became aware of the fact that unjustified costs were included in the prices .
while the expenses of ooo iv-consulting ( supplies cold water ) show that 4 million roubles were spent hiring cars at above-market prices .
and there are a host of examples like this throughout the country .
the people are handing over their last rouble to ‘ public utilities ’ and , what &apos;s more , they are paying in a timely manner : according the ministry of construction , housing , and utilities of the russian federation , the average collection rate is 94 % of the population .
he is charged under several articles of the criminal code at once : embezzlement , money laundering , abuse of power , and so forth .
according to investigators , as head of a fund that was involved in the repair of city facilities , makarov entered into contracts with business owners who did not actually perform work , but were still paid .
the businessmen simply returned a large portion of the money to him .
while , as the owner of a property management company , makarov collected money from the population , but didn &apos;t pay service providers and used the money for his own purposes .
as a result , damages to the budget and residents are in the millions of roubles .
makarov &apos;s fraudulent scheme is sadly typical of russia .
a whole wave of arrests and detentions of directors of property management companies , who embezzled citizens &apos; money , has swept across the country .
in kamchatka , the trial of a. kokhan continues ; incidentally , he is also a former city council member and is accused of fraud amounting to 91.7 million roubles .
according to investigators , between 2012 and 2013 , he established 6 property management companies and created 3 limited liability companies in elizovo in kamchatka krai .
one of them carried out contractual work for a property management company , while the other two played the role of payment processing centres , that is , they took money from the population .
however , a. kokhan never transferred the funds to the power suppliers , but spent it on his precious self .
it &apos;s fairly difficult to litigate in the housing and communal services sector .
cases aren &apos;t opened or drag on .
and very complicated housing legislation ‘ helps ’ with this , figures svetlana razvorotneva , executive director of the non-profit partnership , housing control .
we don &apos;t have time to start working on one law , before we devise a new one that is necessary to get the previous one to work .
there are also too few experts , including judges , in the area of housing and communal services .
lawyers themselves acknowledge that housing law is given very little attention at universities .
refusals to initiate criminal proceedings and red tape during investigations are even reported in the prosecutor general &apos;s office .
of the 3,500 pending criminal cases in 2015 , less than half made it to trial .
in the rest of the cases , the investigations took on a protracted nature , and every fifth case was suspended in connection with failure to identify the accused party .
it is not uncommon that mistakes made by law enforcement officials are written off by them on gaps in the current legislation .
the law exists , but inquiry bodies are in no hurry to initiate and investigate such cases .
in the second half of 2015 , there were about 230 reports of forgery , but only 60 criminal cases were initiated .
in the first 5 months of this year , their number has only slightly increased to 99 .
but what is meant by the falsification of tenants meeting minutes ?
it means : a change in the management of the building , and financial and other issues that circumvent the opinion of the owners .
but it also means that ordinary companies , that want to work honestly and don &apos;t ‘ milk ’ the population , can &apos;t break into the housing and communal services market .
it turns out that tenants are losing out , and so are small and medium businesses .
primarily , due to the eradication of corruption , in and of itself , throughout the state , assures anton zharkov , a member of the duma committee on property issues .
and currently , this work is actively underway .
it &apos;s not just isolated actions : it &apos;s a deliberate policy of fighting corruption .
of course , not all regions are in such a sad state .
in particular , there are no signs of scandal in the capital .
why are there no such scandals in the housing and communal services sector in moscow , as there are in many other regions ?
well , because the city government has shown an iron will and has established order , anatoly vyborny , a member of the duma committee for security and combating corruption , told aif .
i am referring to personnel issues , legislative amendments , and legal education .
close supervision of property management companies has been instituted and they have all gone through the licensing process .
citizens &apos; complaints are dealt with promptly and in full public view ( and the appeals of residents and responsive measures are posted on the internet portal of the government of moscow ) .
many people not only pay their monthly bills , but also keep a close eye on what is written on them , and how the building is being maintained .
the public &apos;s awareness about the rights of owners and the responsibilities of resource-supplying and property management organisations is very high .
plus , moscow checks the reasonableness of rates for housing and communal services , because a sizeable portion of budgetary funds goes towards subsidies and benefits for a multitude of population categories .
probably , all of this is what explains the calm situation in moscow .
so , it turns out that everything depends on the will of regional authorities ?
perhaps the weak-willed should change jobs ?
the turkish gambit .
can erdogan forgo a friendship with the eu and the united states ?
the president of turkey , recep tayyip erdoğan , has given an ultimatum to the united states , demanding a choice be made between turkey and fethullah gülen , an islamic preacher accused of organising the coup .
he announced this while speaking to his supporters in ankara .
erdoğan urged the americans to withdraw support for the fethullah terrorist organisation .
this is not the first statement from turkey in which the united states is urged to change its position .
experts believe that the rift in turkey &apos;s relations with the west is continuing to grow and could lead to another attempt to change power in the country .
‘ sooner or later , america will make a choice between turkey and feto ( fethullah terrorist organisation ) .
either feto , which organised the coup , or democratic turkey .
they must make this choice ’ , the anatolian agency quotes erdoğan as saying in an appeal made on wednesday evening in ankara .
the president of turkey once again , but this time more sternly , urged the united states to comply with his demand , which he first voiced immediately after quelling the rebellion .
to recall , on the night of 16 july , in turkey , an attempt was made by high-ranking representatives of the turkish army to overthrow the country &apos;s legitimate government , and an attempt on the life of the head of state was also made .
however , after recep erdoğan made an appeal to the people , the rebellion was quelled , and its organisers and participants were arrested .
in total , about 8 thousand people fell under suspicion , including , in addition to military personnel , the likes of teachers and scientists .
according to recep erdoğan , fethullah gülen , who lives in the state of pennsylvania in the united states , acted as their mentor .
erdoğan &apos;s supporters have also suggested that the americans might also have been directly involved in the coup .
the united states has denied all the accusations made against it , refuses to extradite gülen , and has advised a change in tone .
the most recent statement on this matter from representatives of the state department were made at the time of erdoğan &apos;s visit to saint petersburg this past tuesday .
however , this is not stopping the president of turkey , who is stubbornly sticking to his guns and is also making demands on his other western partners .
‘ ankara will stop fulfilling its obligations under the migration agreement with the eu if brussels does not set a date for the cancellation of visa restrictions on turkish citizens ’ , turkey ’ s minister for eu affairs , Ömer Çelik , stated on 9 august .
according to him , the introduction of amendments to the anti-terrorism law by ankara , as required by the eu , would put the internal security of europe at risk .
note that , on 1 august , sigmar gabriel , vice chancellor of germany , demanded that turkey stop blackmailing the european union with threats to open the borders to migrants , in order to achieve a simplification of the visa regime with the eu .
his words were in response to a corresponding statement from turkey ’ s foreign minister , mevlüt Çavuşoğlu .
Çavuşoğlu made another provocative statement this past wednesday , suggesting that turkey may withdraw from nato .
the head of the turkish foreign ministry did not rule out that the country would consider the possibility of leaving the alliance if they didn &apos;t receive the expected support from it .
the decision to increase cooperation with russia in the defence sector is not a step against nato .
there are nato countries that cooperate with foreign states in the area of defence , that import missiles ’ , Çavuşoğlu stated in an interview with anadolu agency .
according to him , turkey , from now on , needs to create its own defence system based on its own technologies , as well as cooperate with other countries .
‘ up until now , turkey had been trying to cooperate with nato member countries , but the results have been disappointing , and we have started to look for other partners ’ , the minister said .
experts believe that all of this speaks to the serious differences between turkey and the west , and the country &apos;s reorientation towards the east .
director of the international institute for political expertise , evgeny minchenko , believes that recep erdoğan is playing his game right now and can &apos;t afford a serious confrontation with the west .
he is very much tied to the west both in terms of business and in terms of the military ( turkey is a member of nato ) , so i think that erdoğan will try to find a balance , while preserving the framework of relations with the west .
although , of course , it would be more convenient for the americans to have a completely obedient person in this post ’ , the expert explained to aif .
according to him , it can &apos;t be ruled out that , following the turkish leader &apos;s statements ( about the non-payment of compensation to the eu , demands for a visa-free space with europe , and the extradition of gülen from the united states ) , he will come under pressure .
‘ recep erdoğan will be faced with a deterioration of relations with america and the european union , and , in particular , they will apply pressure on him in terms of humanitarian issues , dictatorial methods of governance , and so on ’ , minchenko believes .
director of the centre for political information , alexey mukhin , concedes that the president of turkey will change his point of view on relations with russia as soon as it &apos;s in his interests to do so .
eight months ago , erdoğan took a very tough stance against russia and sought favour in the west by any means .
for a very short time , the situation has been reversed .
there are no guarantees that , after some time , the president of turkey won &apos;t change his priorities once again .
i think that erdoğan has entered a period of shuttle diplomacy .
having found himself between the two poles of the west and russia , he will try to seek maximum benefit for himself ’ , mukhin believes .
in his opinion , right now , the main task of the president of turkey is to hold onto political power in the country , and this is precisely why he needs russia and a partnership with vladimir putin , so that the united states stops supporting gülen .
both the eu and united states need turkey , with whose help they are controlling the situation in syria and the middle east .
therefore , a consensus with turkey will be reached ’ , the expert believes .
a different point of view is espoused by anna glazova , head of the centre for asia and the middle east .
currently , turkey &apos;s relations with both the eu and the united states are quite tense , and this is connected , first and foremost , with the domestic policies being pursued by erdoğan himself .
i think that this crisis in relations will worsen and , against the backdrop of this crisis , turkey &apos;s leaders will try to carry out a reset of policy in the middle east and in relations with russia .
it &apos;s no accident that the president of turkey , as well as a number of turkish politicians , claim they are willing to change their stance on a whole range of issues related to syria , differences with israel have been settled , and active political engagement with iran is currently underway ’ , glazova explained to aif , suggesting that erdoğan &apos;s next step will be the normalisation of relations with egypt .
according to her , the policy currently being carried out by erdoğan is a return to the foreign policy concept that was being pursued by turkey before the start of the arab revolutions .
‘ it was then , from a position of &quot; zero problems with neighbours &quot; that turkey began to actively develop its relations in the middle east and asia ’ .
the president of turkey just finished very successful visits to russia and african countries .
therefore , this vector of foreign policy will continue to evolve and contribute to the strengthening of turkey &apos;s position both in the regional and international arena ’ , the expert believes .
glazova believes that it would be incredibly difficult for turkey to return to the previous relationship with eu ; the question right now is whether or not the eu will start to get tough in response to turkey , which could resort to opening the borders to migrants and , as such , create serious problems for europe .
junior doctors strike : calls for fresh industrial action
representatives of junior doctors have called on their union to authorise fresh industrial action in their dispute about a new contract .
the junior doctors committee ( jdc ) of the british medical association ( bma ) is to ask its full council to back more industrial action from early september .
the jdc says ministers have failed to address concerns about the contract .
junior doctors and medical students voted in july to reject a contract deal agreed with the bma .
it was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the ballot .
in a letter to members released on twitter on thursday night , the jdc &apos;s chair ellen mccourt said the government had remained &quot; persistently silent &quot; on issues which , she said , had resulted in the contract being rejected .
she said : &quot; in light of this , the jdc executive has voted to reject the proposed new contract in full and to call for formal re-negotiations on all of your concerns . &quot;
in response to the government &apos;s silence , jdc exec has today made a formal request for a special meeting of bma council to authorise a rolling programme of escalated industrial action beginning in early september .
the dispute has led to junior doctors taking part in six strikes this year , including the first all-out stoppages in the history of the nhs .
the bma &apos;s junior doctor leader , dr johann malawana , resigned following the vote to reject the negotiated terms of the contract , which the bma had recommended .
he had told bma members the deal was a good one that should be accepted , during meetings ahead of the poll of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students .
following the vote , health secretary jeremy hunt said the contract would be imposed on medics in england .
russia and turkey : an &apos; alliance of misfits &apos; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of russia and turkey met on tuesday to shake hands and declare a formal end to an eight-month long war of words and economic sanctions .
but , as vladimir putin greeted his turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of a st. petersburg palace , i got the distinct impression that ankara wants this reconciliation the most .
there was the handshake , yes .
but mr putin &apos;s smile looked thin and he was hardly oozing warmth even by his own restrained standards .
recep tayyip erdogan by contrast talked repeatedly of his &quot; dear friend &quot; mr putin - five times , according to one report .
i lost count .
he also pledged that relations with russia would return not just to their pre-crisis level , but even higher .
the next day one newspaper here described mr erdogan as acting as if nothing bad had ever happened .
to me , his enthusiasm implied the opposite .
but a lingering coolness emanating from mr putin showed that russia &apos;s leader has forgotten nothing .
in fact , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening comments : turkey &apos;s shooting down of a russian fighter plane on the syrian border .
moscow &apos;s reaction at the time was furious .
mr putin lashed out , accusing ankara of stabbing moscow in the back .
the offence was even greater , coming from a supposed friend .
rebuilding real trust will be hard , perhaps impossible .
russian public opinion has also turned since november .
for months , state-controlled media conducted a staggering , all-out offensive against ankara .
all of a sudden , it seemed like turks were to blame for everything .
most serious were accusations from top officials that mr erdogan &apos;s own family has profited from an illegal trade in oil from areas of syria controlled by the so-called islamic state .
he &apos;s denied that emphatically .
but in st. petersburg came the official message that it &apos;s time to move on .
after all , this meeting only happened because mr putin got the apology he demanded from president erdogan .
russia could claim a victory of sorts .
for ankara the benefits of calling a truce are clear .
first and foremost , erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ousted from power last month in a failed coup .
repeat terror attacks on turkey have clearly shaken him too .
there is also an economic motive .
russian sanctions have hit hard - particularly the ban on charter flights , which usually carry several million russian tourists to the turkish coast each year .
the number has slumped by almost 90 % .
as for russia , tour operators and charter companies here will certainly be relieved when flights eventually resume .
they &apos;re banking on a late-season rush to the mediterranean .
and even this week , state tv has been predicting cheaper fruit and vegetables once turkish agricultural imports are permitted again .
&quot; tourists that way , tomatoes back here , &quot; as a report in vedemosti newspaper phrased it .
but the visit also had additional political value for moscow .
ankara is angry with the west for what it considers a weak response to the attempted takeover .
add to that its long-standing grudge at the snail &apos;s pace of talks to join the eu and step in mr putin - who is keen to capitalise on the chill and chip away at turkey &apos;s ties with the west .
the russian leader certainly won bonus points with ankara for calling in support of the elected authorities after the attempted coup .
mind you , that &apos;s a given for moscow which has its own deep-seated fear of regime change .
so the summit at this glitzy , seaside palace allowed russia and turkey to present what one analyst described to me as an &quot; alliance of misfits &quot; : two countries that feel rejected and mistreated by the west , joining forces .
still , despite the public display of reconciliation , the two still have major differences .
the key one is syria , where moscow has recently been casting itself as peacemaker but where russia and turkey back opposite sides .
it could be telling that after almost three hours of initial talks , the two presidents told a press conference that they hadn &apos;t even touched on the topic .
turkey &apos;s president deliberately avoided answering a question on their differences , while mr putin chose to underline them .
there is no clear consensus on where they can seek common ground on syria .
but after months of open hostility - and given the potential for utter disaster when nato member turkey shot down that russian fighter jet - it is surely better that the two leaders are at least talking again .
royal bank of scotland to disappear for customers outside scotland
the brand rbs is to be reduced to a back office role , according to the bank &apos;s chief executive .
royal bank of scotland will disappear for customers outside scotland .
ross mcewan told bbc scotland that the rbs brand was associated with the bank &apos;s global ambitions .
it has retreated from them since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be bailed out .
during that time , brand strategists have used &apos; rbs &apos; to protect other consumer finance brands .
it was backed with millions of pounds in sponsorship of international sport , from six nations rugby to wimbledon champion andy murray .
but now , it has been judged right to let more national brands come to the fore .
royal bank of scotland will be used with scottish customers , but will not be initialised .
in england and wales , all rbs references , outside head office and the stock exchange listing , will be changed to natwest .
the ulster bank brand is already used for customers in the republic of ireland and northern ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for private banking , which will get more prominence - coutts , adam &amp; co , drummond , and holt &apos;s military bank .
mr mcewan was interviewed during a tour of customers and staff in inverness-shire .
he told bbc scotland : &quot; the rbs brand will end up becoming our investor brand and the one that our staff are employed with , because we are now becoming much more a bank of brands . &quot;
as the bank itself became a global brand , rbs became the global brand .
i &apos;m now saying we no longer have global aspirations , we have local aspirations .
each one of those brands will stand for something quite different in their own communities , and our staff will work with customers under those brands .
rbs had already stated that it would not to continue its six nations sponsorship , and it has been raising the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship .
&quot; the time is right for us to move to the bank of brands , because underneath ( we &apos;ve been asking ) how do we focus on making this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the chief executive .
it would have been very cynical three years ago if we &apos;d said we &apos;re going to be a great bank for customers and put those brands out there .
but with the work we &apos;ve been doing , focussing on the customers needs , not our own , i think you &apos;re seeing a lot of change .
we can bring those brands back up again , so i think the time is right .
frankie dettori reaches 3,000 winners with victory at newmarket on predilection
dettori sprays champagne after a double at newmarket takes him to 3,000 wins
jockey frankie dettori secured his 3,000th british winner at newmarket on friday .
he brought up the landmark with his second winner of the night at his local track - on predilection , trained by john gosden .
the 45-year-old italian is the sixth jockey to reach the landmark in flat racing .
he follows sir gordon richards , doug smith , lester piggott , pat eddery and willie carson .
three-time champion jockey dettori , who earlier won on ghayyar , said : &quot; it &apos;s special . &quot;
i &apos;m very emotional because my family are here as well
i &apos;m very pleased for it to have happened at newmarket because this is where i landed 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not a royal ascot - it &apos;s a mundane friday night with 20,000 people .
i &apos;m relieved and very humble .
dettori soaks up the cheers as he brings in predilection after victory
two jockeys have reached the milestone in jump racing - champion jockey richard johnson and retired 20-time champion sir anthony mccoy , who had more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career .
lester piggott , nine-time derby winner , 4,493 career wins
frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era and it is no surprise he has reached this landmark so few have achieved before him .
he is stylish and strong , but it is his tactical nous that sets him apart from others in the weighing room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for racing , his enthusiasm and charisma have been drawing fans to the sport for years .
i said to frankie a few weeks ago at epsom he &apos;d have ridden 6,000 winners if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big-race jockey !
seriously though , frankie &apos;s been riding winners in the uk for the best part of 30 years which is great to see .
he &apos;s a lively character which is good for british racing but more than that , he &apos;s an incredible jockey .
frankie dettori celebrated the milestone with a trademark flying dismount
from flying finishes to flying dismounts , frankie dettori has been the poster boy of british flat racing for two decades .
it has been a rollercoaster ride .
stacks of big-race winners , including his famous 1996 &apos; magnificent seven &apos; at ascot , but he also survived a plane crash and served a drugs ban .
three years ago he initially struggled when returning from that six-month suspension , but he showed formidable strength of character to defy the doubters and return to his best .
and he may not be done for some time - dettori has previously said he would like to carry on competing until the age of 50 , at least .
russia &apos;s putin sacks chief of staff sergei ivanov
russian president vladimir putin has unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff sergei ivanov .
mr ivanov has been part of mr putin &apos;s trusted inner circle for many years .
the 63-year-old has now been made a special representative for environmental and transport issues .
a statement from the kremlin said that mr putin had &quot; decreed to relieve ivanov of his duties as head of the russian presidential administration , &quot; but gave no reason .
mr ivanov &apos;s deputy since 2012 , anton vaino , has been appointed as his successor .
mr vaino , 44 , is a former diplomat .
born in the estonian capital tallinn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious moscow state institute of international relations ( mgimo ) and served in the tokyo embassy .
later he managed presidential protocol and government staff , the kremlin website says ( in russian ) .
on being appointed , he told mr putin : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
i think the administration &apos;s most important task is to support your activity as head of state in terms of drafting laws and control over how your instructions are implemented .
mr putin told a russian tv station on friday that mr ivanov had asked to leave the post , and recommended that mr vaino should replace him .
do the smiles convince ?
this is a move that has mystified moscow .
sergei ivanov has long been one of vladimir putin &apos;s closest allies and , like him , served in the soviet security service , the kgb .
as chief of staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
in a meeting with president putin shown on state television both men claimed that the chief of staff was stepping down at his own request .
but despite the smiles for the cameras , few here are convinced - especially now , just before parliamentary elections .
so is this the fall-out from some kind of power struggle ?
no-one knows yet .
but the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president , suddenly wanted to run russia &apos;s environmental policy - has been met with great scepticism .
in remarks to mr putin , quoted on the kremlin website , mr ivanov said &quot; it &apos;s true that in early 2012 i asked you , in a conversation , to entrust me with this very complicated post , even - you could say - troublesome post , for four years .
well , it turns out that i &apos;ve been presidential chief of staff for four years and eight months .
mr ivanov took up the post in december 2011 .
he served previously as a deputy prime minister and defence minister .
he is a member of the russian security council and a former member of the kgb state security service , like mr putin .
in the late 1990s , when mr putin was head of the federal security service ( fsb ) , which replaced the kgb , mr ivanov was appointed as his deputy .
when mr putin came to power , he named mr ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most .
it was once thought that mr ivanov might become president of russia after mr putin &apos;s second term , as a third term for mr putin would have been unconstitutional .
but that post was taken by another close putin ally , dmitry medvedev .
mr putin became prime minister , before returning to the presidency just three-and-a-half years later .
criminal minds star thomas gibson sacked after hitting producer
gibson was involved in a physical altercation on the set of the show in los angeles last month .
abc studios and cbs television studios , which produce the series , announced his dismissal in a joint statement .
gibson , who played special agent aaron hotchner , issued an apology on thursday before his termination was announced .
there were creative differences on the set and a disagreement .
i regret that it occurred , &quot; he said in a statement .
details on how gibson &apos;s character will be written out of the show , which follows a team of fbi agents , is expected to come at a later date , according to the abc studios and cbs television studios statement .
the 54-year-old , who previously starred on the sitcom dharma &amp; greg , had been on the show since its first season in 2005 .
&quot; i love criminal minds and have put my heart and soul into it for the last twelve years , &quot; gibson said in a statement released on friday .
i had hoped to see it through to the end , but that won &apos;t be possible now .
i would just like to say thank you to the writers , producers , actors , our amazing crew , and , most importantly , the best fans that a show could ever hope to have .
the show is slated to return for its twelfth season on 28 september .
mystery as fish land in banff garden
a banff man has appealed for help in identifying fish that have appeared in his garden in banff .
kevin bain thinks the 75 fish could be sand eels deposited by a waterspout .
mr bain , who lives about 500m from the sea , posted footage of the spectacle on periscope in the hope someone could shed light on the appearance of the two-inch fish .
queensferry crossing : bridge now connected to fife
the £ 1.35bn project is now due to be complete by may 2017
engineers have joined the queensferry crossing &apos;s north deck and viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected to fife .
it is the first of four closures between the &quot; deck fans , &quot; which are now nearing completion around each of the bridge &apos;s three towers .
the bridge section from fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 stay-cables .
the £ 1.35bn project is now due to be complete by may 2017 .
economy secretary keith brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the land on to the bridge .
he said : &quot; this is a historic and symbolic moment in the building of the queensferry crossing .
we &apos;re all witnessing engineering on a truly epic scale on this project , with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel used just to build this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge completing the closure between the viaduct and bridge deck is a delicate operation involving extremely precise tolerances for fit up .
overall , nearly 79 % of the total bridge deck is now in place , the final section of deck is having its concrete deck cast in rosyth today , meaning all the deck is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge .
michael martin , forth crossing bridge constructors project director said : &quot; the first closure on any bridge project is always a significant milestone .
on this fantastic project , this closure represents leading edge civil engineering .
after installing the last road deck section and connecting it to the expanding north tower road deck , we then had to close the remaining gap on the north - or landward - side .
this was done by pulling the northern approach viaduct 700 millimetres southwards .
this was a massive and , at the same time , very delicate operation .
massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long , weighs approximately 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled up a gradient of about 3 % .
delicate because the tolerances the team were working to were tiny - just a few millimetres either way .
happily , it all went very well .
moelfre bay rescue : three men are &apos; lucky to be alive&apos;
three men are &quot; lucky to be alive &quot; after they were thrown from their fishing boat off anglesey .
moelfre rnli lifeboat station raised the alarm at 13 : 20 bst on friday after a crew saw the incident unfold in moelfre bay .

pokémon go a worthy hunt for health and happiness

that teenagers and children do not get outside to play any more , preferring to spend their free time looking at screens , has been the lament of many for the the past decade .
pokemon go is getting people off the couch and into some activity .
screen time was initially limited to the television then video games and more recently smartphones .
so it is great to see that technology and being active outdoors are not mutually exclusive .
i am of course referring to the craze that is pokémon go , an app based on the characters first created for video games in the 1990s ( it later spawned a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin offs ) .
like many pop cultural phenomena it had gone off the boil somewhat before this new game was made available in the us , australia and new zealand in early july .
the launch in other countries was then delayed by the massive response , which overloaded servers .
within days , pokémon go had more users than tinder and nearly as many as twitter .
so how does it work ?
in a nutshell , players on smartphones go out looking for pokémons , which are tracked with a gps and , once found , can be &apos; photographed &apos; ( via a screenshot on your phone ) or &apos; captured &apos; .
a generation who played the game when younger have joined the craze , jumping off the couch for the search .
in the us , the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by the &quot; average &quot; person each day .
cardiogram , an app for the apple watch that tracks 35,000 users , told the washington post recently that within two days of the game launching , the number of people it tracked who did 30 minutes of exercise each day jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent .
the company does not know who is playing pokémon go - it just sees raw data on exercise levels .
many public health campaigns to get people to &quot; find 30 , &quot; &quot; get off the couch &quot; and &quot; be active everyday &quot; have fallen on deaf ears because most public health messages are boring and delivered by people who look miserable .
yet the importance of exercise cannot be understated .
those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of getting cancer or depression .
activity helps with weight management , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits too long to list here .
but the beauty of pokémon go is it gets people outside doing something they enjoy .
thus you are covering three pillars of health - movement , fresh air and sunshine , and fun .
some people are even making new friends on the hunt .
as usual there are po-faced killjoys looking for something to complain about .
and yes somebody might walk into a door .
so what ?
a breakthrough has occurred .
for while smartphone apps like fitbit could previously track our activity , they didn &apos;t give us a reason to exercise like this game does .
the novelty will wear off and use will subside in due course .
however because of pokmeon &apos;s success there will be more games that combine apps and virtual reality with being active in the real world , helping many people on the hunt to be more active , fitter and healthier .

simone biles nails all-around gold in women &apos;s gymnastics
forget the pressure .
forget the hype .
simone biles is immune to all of it .
dynamic on vault .
effortless on beam .
jaw-dropping on floor .
brilliant all over .
and now , finally , an olympic champion .
the 19-year-old american gymnast soared to the all-around title on thursday , putting the gap between herself and the rest of the world on full display under the olympic spotlight .
her total of 62.198 was well clear of silver medalist and &quot; final five &quot; teammate aly raisman and russian bronze medalist aliya mustafina .
united states &apos; simone biles performs on the balance beam during the artistic gymnastics women &apos;s individual all-around final at the 2016 summer olympics in rio de janeiro , brazil , thursday .
biles became the fourth straight american woman to win the all-around title and fifth overall while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever .
she burst into tears when her final total was posted and her long journey to this moment ended .
the achievement puts her in the same league as once-in-a-generation athletes like michael phelps who have taken their sports to new heights :
biles has spent the last three years dominating her sport , winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold - with routines so astonishing in their mix of ambition and precision that 1984 olympic champion mary lou retton called her &quot; the greatest gymnast i &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
one last test awaited in brazil , a contest not so much between biles and the rest of the field but between herself and the burden of oversized expectations .
anything less than heading back to her family &apos;s home in spring , texas , with a fistful of golds would be seen as a disappointment .
united states &apos; simone biles , left , and aly raisman embrace after winning gold and silver respectively for the artistic gymnastics women &apos;s individual all-around final at the 2016 summer olympics in rio de janeiro , brazil , thursday , aug .
biles earned the first one on tuesday while serving as the exclamation point to retiring national team coordinator martha karolyi &apos;s going away party .
while biles insisted she &apos;s never looked ahead during her long run at the top , that &apos;s not exactly true .
a portion of her floor exercise routine - the one that includes her signature tumbling pass - is set to latin music that would fit right at home in the street right outside the rio olympic arena .
it &apos;s not a coincidence .
the girl adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and discovered by coach aimee boorman &apos;s mother during a field trip to the gym where boorman was coaching has become a force .
she hasn &apos;t lost an all-around competition since the summer of 2013 , a winning streak that should go for as long as biles wants it to .
though mustafina took a small lead through two rotations , it was a mirage .
balance beam and floor exercise - where biles is the defending world champion - lay in wait .
she went back in front with a 15.433 on beam - and capped it with a 15.933 on floor .
raisman hugged her gently as they awaited the final score - a mere formality - and tears appeared around biles &apos; glittery red , white and blue eyeliner when the vision she once wrote in a scrapbook became a reality .
raisman &apos;s performance was a bit of revenge from four years ago , when she tied for third but lost the bronze to mustafina on a tiebreaker .
this time , the 22-year-old team captain the americans call &quot; grandma &quot; was well ahead .
she blew kisses to the crowd after her floor exercise , overcome by a comeback that at times seemed in doubt .
as for biles , the 19-year-old &apos;s viral tweet from earlier this week now carries a whole new meaning :
police : 3 victims in serial killer case shot while listening to music in car
two women and a 12-year-old girl who died in the deadliest attack in phoenix &apos;s first serial killer case in a decade were sitting in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot , according to police reports released thursday .
angela rochelle liner , stefanie r. ellis and ellis &apos; daughter maleah were shot on june 12 while the car was parked in a driveway , authorities said .
the gunman fired as many as eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car then fled in another vehicle , the report states .
police say the triple killing doesn &apos;t appear to have been the result of a robbery because the attacker didn &apos;t take purses or $ 2,900 in the possession of one of the adult victims .
phoenix police spokesman sgt. jonathan howard said the shooting prompted investigators to look at whether it was tied to four earlier attacks .
in all , seven people have been killed and two others wounded in nine attacks in two predominantly hispanic neighborhoods over a four-month period .
&quot; it &apos;s occurring within a residential area in front of a home , &quot; howard said to cbs affiliate kpho earlier this month .
the suspect is believed to have used several vehicles , including as a late-1990s brown nissan , a late-1990s black bmw and a white cadillac or lincoln .
investigators have declined to reveal the evidence that led them to conclude the attacks are related and committed by the same killer .
ellis , 33 , was hospitalized for her injuries and later died .
liner , 31 , and ellis &apos; daughter maleah died at the scene .
a witness told police that it wasn &apos;t unusual for them to sit in a parked car listening to music .
authorities also released a police report on a shooting that targeted an unoccupied pickup truck just a half-hour before the triple killing and is believed to have been the work of the serial killer .
investigators found bullet casings and recovered a bullet from a seat and bullet fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of 6-year-old with microcephaly : &quot; it gets better &quot;
like most six-year-olds , edmund picciuto loves singing , toys and , of course , his mother .
but unlike most of his peers , edmund has microcephaly , the result of a genetic disorder his mom elizabeth picciuto didn &apos;t know about while pregnant .
when he first came home my initial thought was , i can &apos;t do this .
i can &apos;t do this .
i didn &apos;t sign up for this .
which is not true at all -- of course you sign up for it , &quot; she said .
she and her husband , vincent , were told edmund might never recognize them , and that he might not even survive .
some doctors went as far as suggesting he be institutionalized .
&quot; my first response was &apos; i didn &apos;t think people did that anymore , &apos; &quot; picciuto explained .
edmund walks with the help of a walker .
edmund didn &apos;t sit up or crawl until he was three , and he still doesn &apos;t talk .
but he &apos;s slowly meeting some milestones .
he &apos;s walking with help , and riding a bike .
he also loves playing with his two brothers , and singing .
elizabeth demonstrates the sign language edmund made up for &quot; please sing to me . &quot;
&quot; we &apos;re teaching him sign language , &quot; picciuto told cbs news .
but it &apos;s not just typical sign language -- she says edmund has invented some of his own signs .
microcephaly can arise from a number of different conditions : genetic ones like edmund &apos;s , and infections during pregnancy from viruses like measles and zika .
symptoms and prognosis can vary widely .
it &apos;s too early to tell how it will affect the lives of those infected with zika .
picciuto remembers the emotional toll of an uncertain future .
i kept saying , what &apos;s going to happen ?
what &apos;s going to happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t really know .
i actually haven &apos;t asked for a prognosis in forever , because i don &apos;t expect anyone to really be able to tell me .
but picciuto has hopeful advice for the mothers of babies with birth defects from zika .
it gets better .
you know it will get better for you .
you will love your child , and your child will love you .
heavy rain , flooding prompts rescues in louisiana , mississippi
heavy rain and widespread flooding in louisiana lead the governor to declare a state of emergency on friday , with more rain expected over the state through saturday .
numerous rivers in southeast louisiana and southern mississippi were overflowing their banks and threatening widespread flooding after extreme rainfall , the national weather service reported .
louisiana gov. john bel edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local officials , and assistance is already on the move to affected parishes .
mike steele , a spokesman for the governor &apos;s office of homeland security and emergency preparedness , said requests were coming in for high-water vehicles , boats and sandbags .
steele said tangipahoa parish alone requested tens of thousands of sandbags .
a flood watch remains in effect until saturday across most of south louisiana .
the weather service said in a statement that an additional 3 to 5 inches could fall over the area .
in south alabama , a flood watch was in effect friday as rain continued in the mobile area .
the comite river near baton rouge and amite river near denham springs , both in louisiana , were predicted to set record crests over the weekend .
forecaster alek krautmann said both rivers could flood many houses in suburban areas near baton rouge .
he also said that flooding downstream in ascension parish is a threat , as those swollen rivers will be slow to drain into lake maurepas .
the tickfaw river , just south of the mississippi state line in liverpool , louisiana , was already at the highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. friday .
rescuers were still plucking people from floodwaters in amite and wilkinson counties in southwest mississippi .
leroy hansford , his wife and stepson were among those rescued earlier friday near gloster .
hansford , 62 , says waters from beaver creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , rose quickly overnight .
he said another stepson who lives nearby alerted him .
&quot; we woke up and the water kept on coming , &quot; hansford said .
it came up to my waist .
his wife told hansford that it &apos;s the highest she &apos;s seen the creek in the 48 years she &apos;s lived there .
hansford said he and his family members all have disabilities , and he &apos;s the only one who can swim .
hansford said emergency workers rescued all three in a large military-style truck and took them to the fire station in gloster , where they were sheltering friday .
krautmann says flooding is &quot; quickly becoming widespread &quot; as heavy rains continue , saying officials are considering evacuation orders .
krautmann says one observer near livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to friday morning .
krautmann said the ground was heavily saturated by rainfall since wednesday .
heavy rain and street flooding prompted the rescue of residents from their homes in tangipahoa parish and the cancellation of classes in five school districts , authorities said .
cbs affiliate wwl reports that an alderwoman in tangipahoa said 200 homes flooded .
residents had been evacuated to two churches but both are now flooding .
parish president robby miller said authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets stranded by high water .
shelters have been opened in the town of amite and the city of hammond to house those who were evacuated .
&quot; they will be allowed to return home once the water starts to recede , &quot; he said .
in the tangipahoa parish city of hammond , close to two dozen streets were closed because of high water , and sandbags were made available for pickup by residents hoping to keep water out of homes and businesses .
&quot; the last major flood we had was in march , &quot; said city administrator lacy landrum .
this one is on track to be a similar event .
in mississippi , harrison county emergency manager rupert lacy said steady rain continued on the gulf coast .
he said a handful of houses were reported as flooded thursday , but none have been reported so far friday .
keith townson , manager of shopper value foods in amite , has lived in the area for 40 years .
&quot; i &apos;ve seen water in some places i have never seen before , &quot; townson said , &quot; and it &apos;s still coming down . &quot;
mahaj brown , 6 , &quot; riddled with bullets , &quot; survives philadelphia shooting
police say a 6-year-old boy has been shot in philadelphia , marking the second shooting of a 6-year-old in the city this week .
the child &apos;s grandparents identified him to cbs philadelphia as mahaj brown .
the grandparents say brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds , including in his groin , leg , arm and abdomen , but was awake when he was transported to the hospital .
&quot; he just took a lot , his little body was riddled with bullets , &quot; his grandmother delores melendez tells the station .
i just can &apos;t believe it .
the boy is listed in critical condition at a hospital and has undergone several surgeries .
family tells the station he is expected to recover .
he was set to start first grade at a local elementary school .
brown was among four people shot in the germantown section .
also shot were three men : two 29-year-olds and one 32-year old .
one of the 29-year-old men was reported in critical condition ; the other two victims were listed in stable condition , according to cbs philadelphia .
the child was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old in critical condition , the station reports .
the other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be a shooter .
investigators tells cbs philadelphia it appears there was crossfire between multiple gunmen .
assault weapon-style shell casings , traced to different assault style weapons , littered the scene .
it appears that this was definitely an ongoing battle .
there were casings in the street , on both sides of the sidewalk .
so it appears that there were multiple armed combatants out here and that they were actively engaged , &quot; philadelphia police captain anthony ginaldi told the station .
multiple houses and vehicles in the area were also struck .
no arrests have been made and police are reportedly reviewing surveillance video .
another 6-year-old , a girl , was hit in her arm by a stray bullet tuesday while playing in front of her home in the west oak lane neighborhood .
she is recovering , and police are still searching for a suspect .
why we need simone , gabby and laurie
that &apos;s what i call this year &apos;s women &apos;s olympic gymnastics team and for more reasons than one .
first , i have been to every summer olympics since 1984 and the usa has never been so dominant .
and second : this team features three gymnasts , simone biles , gabby douglas and lauren &quot; laurie &quot; hernandez , who have been inspiring so many young girls of color .
the make-up of this team , rounded out by aly raisman , who is jewish , and madison kocian , who is catholic , is making everyone proud .
this team looks , finally , like america .
it also has solidified the black and latina female presence at the top of this sport .
for the past four years , the number one female gymnast has been african-american .
last year , simone and gabby were # 1 and # 2 .
this is powerful .
last olympics , gabby douglas was a surprise olympic champion , and america cheered .
now the world has been able to witness the incredible performances of three-time world champion simone biles , douglas and laurie hernandez delivering the unexpected , yet masterful gymnastics routines .
on thursday , simone became the fourth straight american to win gold in the women &apos;s individual all-around event .
and teammate aly raisman earned silver .
we are witnessing the top of the sport , but it does not look like this at gymnastics classes across the country .
simone , gabby and laurie all took the same path as aly and madison to make the olympic team .
they are the &quot; final five &quot; because the next olympic gymnastics team will only have four gymnasts on the team , and this is marta karolyi &apos;s last year coaching .
but the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport , and gymnasts primarily train in private gymnastics clubs that are maintained by parents paying the cost of the training , facility , travel , uniforms , competition fees , hotel fees ( for the coaches and their gymnasts and families ) and the list goes on .
most of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburban neighborhoods that can support the business .
these clubs are where the gymnasts get all of their training , and it &apos;s a costly and long-term commitment for the gymnasts &apos; families .
aimee boorman , coach of simone biles , and maggie haney , coach of laurie hernandez , have both coached their athletes since they started in gymnastics .
we must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to the communities of countless young girls who are inspired by simone , gabby and laurie .
i founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago .
at my organizations , we have provided free and low-cost gymnastics , based in harlem , for over 15,000 urban youth ( primarily black and hispanic ) and have trained national and international champions .
in september , we will be expanding to detroit ( my hometown ) to provide high quality gymnastics to the youth that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great olympic sport .
gymnastics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body and hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination provides life-long benefits for good health , success in school and work .
it is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of young girls to take gymnastics and that is great .
to participate in sport is so important , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank you simone , aly , laurie , gabby and madison for that serious showcase of &quot; girl power &quot; in winning the olympic team gold and for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to begin their path to be healthy , strong and successful young women .
junior doctors set to mount further strikes after rejecting jeremy hunt &apos;s proposal
ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with british medical association officials , but 58 per cent of the 37,000 junior doctors who took part in a ballot had rejected it .
in july , mr hunt revealed plans to impose the contract saying the nhs was in &quot; no man &apos;s land &quot; and any further delay would be damaging for staff and patients .
the first junior doctors are moved onto the new contract , which includes changes to overnight and weekend working practices to improve care at unsociable hours .
dr ellen mccourt , the bma &apos;s junior doctors &quot; committee chair , said in a statement last night : &quot; junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract , particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis , and that it fails to treat all doctors fairly . &quot;
with just eight weeks before the first group of doctors are moved onto the new contract , progress needs to be made and time is running out .
efforts by the bma to resolve the dispute through talks have been met with an unwillingness to engage and , at times , deafening silence from the government .
this is despite a promise from jeremy hunt just last month that his door is always open .
&quot; jeremy hunt needs to act now , lift the imposition and address junior doctors &quot; concerns .
if he does not then junior doctors are clear that they are prepared to take further industrial action .
the last strike at the end of april saw the postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments as nurses and consultants were drafted in to provide cover for doctors on the picket line .
ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with british medical association officials .
the bma wants better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors who would be subject of the contract .
daniel mortimer , chief executive of nhs employers , called on junior doctors not to go ahead with any strikes .
mr mortimer said : &quot; industrial action achieves little or nothing , but places pressure on already stretched teams and services and causes worry , distress and disruption for patients , carers and their families . &quot;
over the last two months we have been talking with the junior doctors committee and have , along with the department of health and others , responded positively to their concerns regarding the guardian role and whistleblowing .
employers were hopeful that the continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as deployment , flexibility in training , additional training for those returning from career breaks , costs of training , mutual recognition of syllabus , study leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers , health education england and the department of health were about honouring the agreements reached with the bma in november , february and may .
the £ 2-a-day drug that can cut heart attack threat
thousands of heart attack patients are to benefit from a £ 2-a-day drug , after officials recommended it be given to more people for longer .
anti-clotting drug ticagrelor slashes the risk of repeat attacks for people with heart disease .
the drug is already given for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of a stroke or another attack .
nhs watchdog nice has advised that it should be given to people for four years , to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
but now nhs watchdog nice has advised that it should be given to people for four years , to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
some 140,000 people have a heart attack in england every year , and a quarter of these go on to have another attack or a stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by the build-up of fatty material in artery walls to form a plaque .
if the plaque breaks apart it can cause a blood clot , blocking blood to the heart causing a heart attack .
and if the clot dislodges it can travel in the blood stream and block blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
people who have already have one attack are at a higher risk of having another .
ticagrelor , which is made by uk firm astrazeneca and sold under the trade name brilique , reduces this risk by making clots less likely .
the draft nice guidance , published today , recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months , followed by 60mg along with aspirin twice a day for another three years .
professor carole longson , director at the nice health technology evaluation centre , said : &quot; despite the availability of effective secondary prevention treatments , as many as a quarter of people who have had a heart attack go on to have another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences . &quot;
fear of a recurrence can have a significant negative impact on a person &apos;s quality of life .
the evidence shows that ticagrelor , in combination with aspirin , is effective at reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack .
in provisionally recommending ticagrelor we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who stand to benefit from it .
because information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - particularly the risk of bleeding - beyond three years is limited , the draft guidance does not recommend treatment with it beyond that period .
pc culture let vote fraud in muslim areas flourish
ex-tower hamlets mayor lutfur rahman was removed from office last year for corruption , prompting the government report
a culture of political correctness has led to a blind eye being turned to widespread voting fraud in muslim communities , a devastating government report reveals today .
ex-cabinet minister sir eric pickles lambasts the police , election watchdogs and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse because of &quot; over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion . &quot;
the former communities secretary , now the anti-corruption tsar , said the intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so bad that police should be allowed to put cordons outside polling stations to protect frightened voters .
he recommends that voters should have to take id to prove who they are when they vote .
currently , a voter merely has to state their name and address .
the report even suggests putting indelible ink on a person &apos;s fingers as they cast their ballot to prevent anyone being able to vote twice .
greater protection should be given to whistleblowers , sir eric says .
he calls for the press to be given greater access to council papers and decisions taken by unofficial committees or working groups .
&quot; this is not solely to protect against electoral fraud , but to protect local government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it , &quot; he said .
the report was ordered by downing street in the wake of the tower hamlets voting scandal in east london .
last year a special election court ruled the sitting mayor , lutfur rahman , should be removed from office following a litany of corrupt and illegal practices .
the court found rahman &quot; cynically perverted &quot; the religious feeling of his muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and islamophobia .
rahman , it was said , &quot; ran his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of faithful muslims to vote for him . &quot;
up to 300 votes were dubious or the result of personation , where a person votes while posing as someone else .
sir eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country .
he voiced particular alarm about postal voting fraud - in which senior members of the muslim community were said to have exerted pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choosing .
sir eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean up the voting system including bringing your id to prove who you are
his report says : &quot; evidence was presented of pressure being put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities , particularly women and young people , to vote according to the will of the elders , especially in communities of pakistani and bangladeshi background .
&quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions had turned a blind eye to such behaviour because of &quot; politically correct &quot; over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion . &quot;
sir eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including banning political activists from handling postal ballot papers to stop &quot; vote harvesting . &quot;
the report , being considered by theresa may , also calls for tougher checks on registration to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and benefit fraud .
consider the options for requiring voters to produce id before voting .
use indelible ink on a person &apos;s fingers once they cast their ballot to prevent anyone voting twice .
carry out systematic checks on a person &apos;s nationality to ensure they are eligible to vote .
put a three-year limit on requests for an automatic postal vote .
ban political campaigners and activists from handling completed postal votes and postal vote envelopes .
give police powers to set up cordons around polling stations .
change the law to make it easier to charge people with intimidation under the representation of the people act 1983 .
make it illegal to take pictures in polling stations .
make it a requirement that only english is to be used in polling stations ( except in wales ) .
strengthen training to ensure staff enforce the rule that voters go to the booth alone .
sir eric savages the metropolitan police , saying it is &quot; astonishing &quot; that no criminal charges were brought after the tower hamlets case .
&quot; the election court disqualified lutfur rahman and his agent for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; he said .
he was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - to a criminal standard of proof - on a series of grounds .
he also criticises the ineffectual &quot; tick-box inspections &quot; of town hall electoral registration departments .
sir eric said : &quot; last year &apos;s court ruling in tower hamlets was a wake-up call .
our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments , yet the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and state of denial by some bodies threatens that good reputation .
crazy for kate &apos;s cyclist lookalike and other celeb doppelgangers of rio olympians
fans of the rio 2016 olympics this week have gone wild for french cyclist pauline ferrand-prevot , who has proven an impressive lookalike for the duchess of cambridge .
but the 24-year-old olympian is far from the only athlete out fighting for gold this summer that boasts their own celebrity doppelganger - at least not according to social media .
so , in honor of the rio games and all the famous faces crossing our screens at the moment , femail have compiled a list of olympians who bear more than a passing resemblance with hollywood celebs .
the hunter and the wolf : u.s. men &apos;s archery team member brady ellison , left , has been compared to leonardo dicaprio since he was a kid
aside from kate &apos;s doppelganger on the cycling track , many people online have been quick to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of a-lister leonardo dicaprio .
u.s. men &apos;s archery team member brady ellison has caused a storm on twitter after images of him looking eerily similar to the wolf of wall street star surfaced .
and in fact , the archer became aware of the social media frenzy and admitted that he has been hearing that he looks like leo since he was a kid .
&apos;i personally don &apos;t see a huge resemblance , maybe besides the facial hair , &apos; brady told huffington post .
&apos;he is a good-looking dude so i guess it &apos;s a compliment . &apos; 
one of the most popular comparisons from london 2012 is undoubtedly going to be pointed out even more this year : the striking likeness between british long jumper greg rutherford and popular actor neil patrick harris .
russian gymnast aliya mustafina , with her large , expressive eyes , has been said to be a dead ringer for cuban-american singer gloria estefan .
and over in the pool , south african swimmer cameron van der burgh has been getting compared to glee star matthew morrison for years now .
changing it up : this user reckons that nathan is an &apos; athletic version &apos; of the inception actor
another long-running comparison has been between tennis star rafael nadal and actor josh hartnett who boast a similar heavy brow and lips .
silver medal swimmer russia &apos;s yulia efimova boasts more than just the same sunkissed skin and blonde hair as actress annalynne mccord , while team usa &apos;s nathan adrian has been said by fans to resemble an &apos; athletic version of joseph gorgon levitt . &apos; 
tough women : soccer star hope solo , left , and dexter actress jennifer carpenter , right , have similar face shapes and eyes
not the only one : one twitter user was very pleased that others also saw the similaritiest
floating a theory : according to this user , perhaps there is a reason behind the pair &apos;s similar looks

commentator byron macdonald thought his mic was turned off when he started to dispense some of his own opinions at the end of the women &apos;s 4x200m freestyle relay final .
macdonald , who was brought on board cbc &apos;s commentary team to provide &apos; color &apos; could be heard saying : &apos; that little 14-year-old from china dropped the ball , baby &apos; .
too excited , went out like stink , died like a pig .
thanks for that .
chinese swimmer ai yanhan , 14 , swam the second leg of the relay in 1 : 57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than canada &apos;s taylor ruck , allowing the canadians to close the gap on china .
viewers across canada were quick to react online after being shocked by the tone and the language used
emmett macfarlane tweeted , &quot; did the cbc announcer just say the 14-year-old swimmer from china &apos; died like a pig &apos; &quot; ? ? ? ?
the idiot didn &apos;t realize they were still on the air . &apos; 
ai yanhan of china in the women &apos;s 4 x 200m freestyle relay final was described as : &apos; that little 14-year-old from china dropped the ball , baby . &apos; 
criticism on twitter came thick and fast against byron macdonald with many calling him out
twitter users did not hold back when the heard how insensitive byron macdonlad was being
another twitter user , sarah paradis , wrote : &apos; wow # byronmacdonald .
you represent the cbc and canada and make us all sound like a bunch of racists . # disgusted .
soon after , scott russel who was hosting cbc &apos;s broadcast apologized on-air for macdonald &apos;s comment , saying : &apos; we apologize the comment on a swim performance made it to air . &apos; 
it was an unfortunate choice of words , we &apos;re sorry it happened . &apos;

the network was also quick to apologize and released a statement .
we sincerely regret that these statements were made , and that they were allowed to go to air .
we moved quickly last night to apologize to our viewers on-air and to our followers on social media .
to be clear , byron &apos;s comments were related to the swimmer &apos;s performance , not to her as an individual .
that said , they were inappropriate and an unfortunate choice of words and byron is very sorry for what he said .
on thursday afternoon , macdonald apologized on-air and attempted to qualify his remark by stating he didn &apos;t mean for it to be construed as a personal attack .
&apos;i would like to take a moment to apologize for a comment that i made last night after the women &apos;s relay , &apos; he said on cbc &apos;s olympic broadcast . &apos; 
&apos;i was referring to a swimmer &apos;s performance , and not to them as a person . &apos; 
&apos;needless to say , there was no disrespect intended and i &apos;m very sorry . &apos; 
primark shopper outraged at woman who brazenly tried on underwear in the middle of the shop
shoppers didn &apos;t know where to look when a woman stripped off to try on knickers on the shop floor in the middle of a primark .
to make it even worse , she sized up how she looked in them , peeled them off and put them back on the shelf .
she carried on browsing and eventually tried on four pairs of underwear at the store in bouverie place shopping centre , folkestone .
the primark store in bouverie place shopping centre , folkestone , where the woman tried on knickers before putting them back on the shelf
a mother-of-two , jenny davidson , who was in the shop at the time , said after trying on the underwear the mystery woman &apos; got dressed again and walked out of the store without buying anything . &apos; 
she said : &apos; people couldn &apos;t believe what they were seeing . &apos; 
standing in the middle of the shop floor , she took a pair of knickers from the display , stripped off her own tights and pants and put them on .
&apos;she didn &apos;t try to find anywhere discreet to do it - she just stood there , bold as brass . &apos; 
&apos;everyone was staring as she took the knickers off again and obviously didn &apos;t like them because she put them back on the shelf . &apos; 
she did the same with three more pairs before finally deciding there was nothing she liked and she got dressed again and walked out .
&apos;she didn &apos;t seem to care who was watching - or think about the person who would eventually buy the knickers she &apos;d been trying on . &apos; 
ms davidson , 33 , who lives in the kent town , said : &apos; how disgusting to think someone is going to take home knickers that another person has been wearing and they haven &apos;t been cleaned . &apos; 
the incident happened on tuesday afternoon .
ms davidson added : &apos; i gather the staff apparently tried to remove the garments from sale after she had left - which is just as well . &apos; 
&apos;i &apos;d hate to get home with a new pair of knickers and find another woman had put them on and taken them off again , and they hadn &apos;t been washed . &apos; 
a primark spokesman said : &apos; primark is aware of an incident which took place in our folkestone store on tuesday august 9 . &apos; 
all the product in question has been removed from sale .
how to defend yourself from gun attacks using krav maga
it &apos;s a dangerous world out there , but this video from dailymail.com might help make it a little safer for you .
we spoke to rhon mizrachi , new york-based grandmaster of the krav maga federation , to find out how to deal with gun-toting muggers at close range .
whether you &apos;re approached from in front or behind , this video will show you how to turn the tables on your mugger .
if approached from behind , mizrachi says , the first thing to do is turn around , so that you can see your attacker and &apos; clear the line of fire &apos; .
you then grasp the gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting them in the face with your free elbow .
a knee to the groin follows , and while the attacker doubles up in pain , you twist the gun from his hands , smack him in the face with the barrel and back up , keeping the weapon trained on him .
for gunmen approaching from the front , it &apos;s a similar technique - get your body out of the line of fire , grab the gun and twist it around so the villain can &apos;t fire .
at the same time , put weight on the gun and punch the attacker in the chest , then twist the gun from his grip before backing up and pointing it at him .
sounds tricky ?
check the video to see exactly how mizrachi does it .
but remember that the safest way out of any mugging - if you &apos;re not a krav maga grandmaster - is to hand over your cash .
traveller ian wright scrapes his tongue along europe &apos;s dirtiest places for travel guide
a british traveller has put his immune system and gag reflex to a serious test - by licking some of the dirtiest and disgusting places in europe .
presenter and travel writer ian wright , 51 , from suffolk , scraped his tongue along a euro note , a piccadilly circus hand rail , a train toilet &apos;s flush button and a russian public telephone to prove the strength of his immune system .
before licking each object , he used a luminometer to show himself , and us , just what he was getting in to .
but the experiment , which has be made into a film called the lickhiker &apos;s guide to inner strength , threw up some surprising results .
the thought of licking a train &apos;s flush button used by thousands of other may be utterly repellent , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
all the way along his trip through europe , mr wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about boosting gut bacteria and about his own health .
fortunately , nothing he licked left him with anything more than a bad taste in his mouth .
mr wright became known for testing the durability of his gut by travelling around the world and eating weird and wonderful things .
from public handrails in train stations to a toilet flush button the task definitely tested his immune system
in the movie made about it he said : &apos; ever since i was a kid i have been fairly carefree with my health and i &apos;ve put all sorts of things in my mouth from soil , eating worms and muddy water . &apos; 
he certainly proved his reputation during the film .
the only thing he turned down was a filthy russian public toilet .
his sample swab showed a luminometer count of over 4000 units .
by comparison , freshly washed hands should come in under 60 .
but there was one russian public toilet he refused to lick after his luminometer count was over 4000 units , when freshly washed hands are less than 60
mr wright and finnish dairy producer valio have produced the traveller &apos;s film called the lickhiker &apos;s guide to inner strength which shows the bacteria count in different place like in the bathroom
he said in the film : &apos; that is close to one of the worst things i have smelled in a toilet . &apos; 
there &apos;s nothing more dirty than that !
i &apos;m not going to lick anything because it &apos;s disgusting in there .
the lickhiker &apos;s guide to inner strength was produced in conjunction with finnish dairy producer valio .
the company provided mr wright with valio gefilus , which contain lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamins c and d to help boost people &apos;s gut bacteria and immune systems .
valio &apos;s senior vice president of snacks , juice and new categories niko vuorenmaa said : &apos; we really wanted to offer consumers something new .
something that would be fascinating to watch and at the same time explain the benefits of probiotics .
we did a lot of crazy brainstorming that ended in the idea &quot; let &apos;s call ian . &quot;
they claim the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of just talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it &apos;s linked to the immune system .
growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way .
i also think the film shows we have a great sense of humour !
tom hakala , who directed the film , added : &apos; let &apos;s put it this way - i would have lost my respect for ian if he had licked some of the things i asked him to , like the disgusting russian toilet that &apos;s shown in the film . &apos; 
naturally some things were easier to get ian to lick , some were pretty tough .
i &apos;m glad we got some of those dirty licks caught on tape . &apos; 
in a survey conducted in 2015 by valio , 84 per cent of the respondents associated lactic acid bacteria specifically with the well-being of the stomach and gut and 58 per cent said they use at least occasionally products containing added lactic acid bacteria .
family of yobs destroyed saltash , cornwall council house ahead of eviction
a family of yobs left their council house with £ 50,000 worth of damage after they were evicted for terrorising their neighbours .
tanya skeldon and her partner shaun trebilcock have been kicked out of the property in saltash , cornwall , after a long list of complaints against them .
after they were forcibly removed from the property , shocked housing associations officers found the property in a state of disrepair .
the walls were left with gaping holes , floorboards were ripped up , rubbish was strewn over the floor and graffiti was daubed on the walls .
the family have now been moved on and are believed to be living in a private accomodation
donna mcevoy , housing manager at cornwall housing , said she feared it might be beyond saving .
she said : &apos; it &apos;s been an absolute nightmare for people down here and i don &apos;t think people should have to live like that .
there are a lot of things to weigh up because this property will probably be known by the not-so-nice element of cornwall .
this family are notorious and their name is notorious .
the couple had three sons who lived at the property intermittently and police say the reign of terror the family inflicted included fighting in the street with baseball bats , intimidating nearby residents , drug use , drug dealing and excessive shouting , arguing and swearing .
skeldon , 47 , whose name was on the tenancy , was given an antisocial behaviour order in june .
old rubbish was found in a number of the rooms of the house , which may be demolished
floor boards had been pulled up in the property , from which drugs had been dealt in the past
neighbours say they were seen fighting in the street and police were regularly called
cornwall housing evicted her and her partner forcefully from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move on voluntarily .
the eviction was hailed by relieved neighbours who said their lives had been made a living hell .
one said : &apos; they didn &apos;t care about anybody . &apos; 
we lived next to them for 20 years and it &apos;s always been bad .
the amount of times we &apos;ve seen the police down here is unbelievable .
&apos;this morning , we couldn &apos;t sleep . &apos; 
we got up because it was so quiet here - we &apos;re not used to that !
it &apos;s going to be lovely now that they &apos;re finally gone .
adam fitzpatrick , cornwall housing &apos;s neighbourhood enforcement manager , said the family failed to cooperate with the local authority .
the family have lived in the house for 20 years , with police regularly called to the property
rubbish and old toys have been thrown down the overgrown side of the council house
he added : &apos; it is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for the behaviour of her and her family as eviction is always the last course of action that cornwall housing considers .
this was a very difficult case as the behaviour was extreme and their actions must have been terrifying for her neighbours to witness .
i appreciate all the work that has been put in by my team , devon and cornwall police and members of the community who bravely came forward to give us information .
i hope that this development will give some comfort to the neighbours and sends out a message that antisocial behaviour will not be tolerated .
mr fitzpatrick said that the three sons had all lived at the property at different times but said they were all in their 20s .
a dirty mattress left on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after the eviction
housing workers will now have to clear away the piles of rubbish which surround the house
in 2014 , police raided the property and found more than 70g in cannabis as well as scales , paraphernalia and £ 1,700 in cash .
skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of a class b drug with intent to supply .
she claimed the money was going towards a headstone for her son , lee skeldon , who died in a car crash in 2013 .
after being made homeless , it is understood that tanya and her partner are now living in private housing in plymouth .
the walls of many of the house &apos;s rooms had graffiti scrawled across them .
police say they will seek to evict tenants who flout the rules of their tenancies
angela crow , of devon and cornwall police , said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to flout the rules .
&apos;this sends out to those who feel that they can behave without recrimination , as well as those blighted by such behaviour , &apos; she said .
criminal and antisocial behaviour will never be tolerated by devon and cornwall police , who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in portugal are left terrified as a low-flying military jet flies skims beach
tourists sun worshipping in aveiro , portugal , had the shock of their lives
a portuguese air force p-3c orion plane swooped in incredibly low
the air force said it was on a training flight but insisted no risk to safety
this is the moment terrified tourists start to panic as a low-flying jet swooped down over a packed beach .
dramatic footage showed the military plane almost coming within touching distance of sunseekers on the stretch of sand in aveiro , northern portugal .
holidaymakers rose to their feet as they became understandably concerned about the noise from the jet engines without being able to see at first what was coming their way through the clouds .
the incident happened in costa nova near aveiro yesterday afternoon .
daniel fernandes , one of several holidaymakers who posted videos of the dramatic fly-by onto social media , said : &apos; it passed really low twice and there was a point when it looked like it was going to crash . &apos; 
nuno arroja added : &apos; i was surfing and swear it felt like the plane was going to fall on top of me . &apos; 
tourists on the beach at aveiro were terrified when the plane appeared out of the murk and flew at an incredibly low altitude
the portuguese air force said today the pilot of the p-3c orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to drop so low because it was the only way of checking them .
he said the jet had flown slightly lower than normal because of poor visibility caused by the smoke from nearby wildfires , but the air force insisted no-one &apos;s safety had been compromised .
wildfires have devastated parts of mainland portugal this summer as well as killing four people on the island of madeira .
the portuguese air force said today the pilot had to fly low because of the conditions - thick fog and smoke from wildfires - which obscured his visibility
the plane was on a training flight and the pilot was being asked to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
the haccp system has been mandatory for food services for more than a year already , but it still hasn &apos;t been implemented in the majority of cafes and restaurants in saint petersburg .
inspections are becoming more prevalent and a business faces fines of up to 1 million roubles .
for more than a year already , conformance with the hazard analysis and critical control points system ( haccp , khassp in the russian version ) – an analysis of risks and critical control points – has been mandatory for manufacturers and transporters of food , as well as for companies in the field of food services in russia , as a member of the customs union ( cu ) .
in saint petersburg , inspections of businesses , by rospotrebnadzor , for compliance with these standards started in february 2015 .
but so far , officials are only issuing fines for specific violations of the rules ( see ‘ the list of documents ’ ... ) .
failure to comply with the regulations as a whole will cost a company 600,000 roubles for the first violation and 1 million roubles for the second .
haccp was developed in the united states in the 1960s as a system that takes into account the risks of working with food and how to prevent them .
at that time , the issue at stake was the safety of food for astronauts .
today , the system is used in all food enterprises , not only in united states , but also in canada and in the european union .
haccp has been in force within the cu since february 2015 .
businesses were given 4 years to develop and implement the system ( the haccp requirement first appeared in the technical regulations of the cu in 2011 ) .
however , both business owners themselves and officials acknowledge that the majority of companies have not even heard about this standard .
unfortunately , for a long time , we were convinced that the standard only applied to food production and not restaurateurs , explained elena tsereteli , head of the public council .
now , everyone is trying to make up for lost time .
the expected timeframe for the resumption of charter flights to turkey is between the end of august and the beginning of september .
but this won &apos;t lead to a spike in demand , since the core market , families with children , are already getting ready for school , experts point out .
the alliance of travel agencies sent a letter to the government yesterday with a request to now allow charters .
‘ for many russian tourists , selecting affordable , quality seaside vacations is still an unresolved issue , because , in the resort towns of krasnodar krai and the republic of crimea , the majority of accommodation facilities are already booked up until the end of september ’ , note the authors of the letter , while emphasising that the establishment of charter operations in august would not significantly affect existing demand for russian seaside tourism products .
the north-west division office of the russian union of travel industry ( ruti ) has reported that , if aviation authorities in russia and turkey are able to come to a decision quickly , then the resumption of charter flights to turkey could be expected within a month .
there is still no clear understanding of when charters will resume ; it ultimately depends on the aviation authorities .
technically , planes could start flying in september , even in august , if tour operators quickly put together packages and reach an agreement with airline companies regarding the required flight paths ’ , says said pavel rumyantsev , deputy director of communications and international projects for the north-west division office of ruti .
according to him , the possible resumption of charters is good news , but it won &apos;t seriously affect the balance of power in the market , because the main buyers of charter tours - families with children - have already returned from vacation and are getting ready for school or are spending their holidays in other countries .
in the autumn season , tours are mainly purchased by individual travellers or couples .
charter packages can count on those who have the ability to spontaneously take a vacation ’ , says pavel rumyantsev .
‘ turkey has a chance to attract lots of tourists if it provides very budget-friendly offers – 50-60 thousand roubles for a trip for two – because there are people who intentionally wait for very cheap tours ’ , says valery rosenthal , ceo of optio-travel travel agency .
otherwise , there &apos;s no sense in counting on a buying frenzy ; the majority of travel has already been planned .
pavel rumyantsev also believes that , because there is demand for scheduled flights to turkey , charters will also be in demand , but there is no sense in expecting a buying frenzy .
‘ for turkey , the launch of charters right now is a rehearsal for next season ’ , says pavel rumyantsev .
‘ the establishment of charters to turkey is good news for the next season ’ , agrees valeriya rubtsova .
the tax code provides for an exemption from personal income tax as established in accordance with legislation on compensation payments within the bounds of established rules related to indemnity for damage caused by injury or another impairment to health .
milk is issued to workers engaged in harmful labour conditions according to the established rules prescribed in article 222 of the labour code of the russian federation .
furthermore , the rules and conditions for issuance are established by order no. 45n of the ministry of health of russia of 16.02.2009 .
according to this document , free milk , or other equivalent food products , is issued to workers on days of actual engagement in jobs with harmful labour conditions due to the presence of harmful factors in the workplace .
on the basis of these specified norms , the federal tax service of russia concluded in a review letter that , article 217 ( 3 ) ( 2 ) of the tax code of the russian federation provides a basis for the exemption from the imposition of personal income tax on income in the form of the cost of the milk issued to workers on days of actual employment in jobs with harmful labour conditions , in accordance with the rules and terms approved by order no. 45n of the ministry of health of russia of 16.02.2009 .
moscow &apos;s gazstroibank has lost its license from the central bank .
on friday , 12 august 2016 , the central bank of russia revoked the license to carry out banking operations from the credit institution , joint stock commercial bank gazstroibank , which is registered in moscow .
according to the regulator , jsc jscb gazstroibank , pursued a high-risk lending policy related to the investment of funds in low-quality assets .
a reasonable estimate of assumed risks , as requested by the regulatory authority , and a reliable picture of the value of the bank &apos;s assets , led to the emergence of grounds for the application of bankruptcy prevention measures at the credit institution .
furthermore , the credit institution was involved in dubious transit transactions .
a temporary administration has been appointed at the bank for a period of validity up until the appointment of the bankruptcy manager or liquidator .
the powers of the executive bodies of the credit institution have been suspended in accordance with federal laws .
jsc jscb gazstroibank is a member of the deposit insurance system .
it bears reminding that , in accordance with federal law no. 177-fz ‘ on the insurance of deposits of individuals in banks of the russian federation ’ , insurance payouts to bank depositors , including sole traders , covers 100 % of the remaining balance , but not more than 1.4 million roubles in total per depositor .
payouts , according to the deposit insurance agency , will commence no later than on 26 august 2016 .
according to accounting statements , as of 1 august 2016 , jsc jscb gazstroibank held 335th place in the banking system of the russian federation in terms of assets .
london schoolgirl who joined isil killed in syria
kadiza sultana , one of three british schoolgirls who left london last year to join isil , has reportedly died in syria .
attorney tasnime akunjee said her family learned of her death in raqqa , syria , a few weeks ago .
she was believed to have been killed by a russian air strike in raqqa , the group &apos;s stronghold in the country , itv news reported on thursday .
sultana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died just as she was making plans to flee the war-torn country and return to britain .
&quot; one would hope that the only benefit out of this is - as a tombstone and testament to others , that these are the risks actually involved in going to a war zone - to dissuade people from ever making that choice really , &quot; akunjee said .
in february 2015 , sultana and two other schoolgirls from east london boarded a flight to turkey and then a bus to the syrian border .
sultana &apos;s family was told she married an isil fighter in syria - and became a widow within months .
reid says clinton will stick with garland as supreme court nominee if elected
senate democratic leader harry reid says he is convinced that democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton will nominate judge merrick garland to the supreme court if she is elected president .
senate republicans have blocked garland &apos;s confirmation since president barack obama nominated him in march .
senate majority leader mitch mcconnell says the next president will choose the person to replace late supreme court justice antonin scalia .
reid said on a conference call thursday that he is predicting clinton will pick garland &quot; with some degree of credibility . &quot;
a spokeswoman for reid later said he had not spoken to clinton directly about whether she would nominate garland and was speculating .
he praised garland and said clinton &apos;s team would not want to &quot; rock the boat &quot; with a new pick .
garland is the chief judge for the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit .
reid said republicans who are blocking garland &apos;s nomination are &quot; minions &quot; and &quot; enablers &quot; of republican presidential candidate donald trump .
he said trump is unfit for office .
treats says nude calendar for &apos; women , as well as men&apos;
treats magazine is partnering with photographer david bellemere to launch a 1970s &apos; pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they &apos;re setting out to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 nu muses calendar .

close friends of neizvestny have been invited to the evening event , including : the poet , yevgeny yevtushenko ; the artist , boris messerer ; president of the pushkin museum , irina antonova ; the director , mark rozovsky ; as well as minister of culture , vladimir medinsky ; head of the department of culture for moscow , alexander kibovsky ; and deputy mayor of moscow , leonid pechatnikov .
earlier , it was reported that ernst neizestny &apos;s relatives plan to hold a memorial service for the sculptor in new york , presumably before 14 august .
vinyl destination : who is actually buying records ?
lonely , middle-aged men love vinyl .
before you rush to litter the comments section with gnarly insults under the pseudonym notalllonelymiddleagedmen , this statement derives from actual data .
according to yougov , the much talked-about record resurgence is driven not by a boom in millennials who want to embrace the novelty of a physical item , but by midlife nostalgia .
those who have recently purchased a vinyl album are most likely to be aged between 45 and 54 , apparently .
in fact , those in the 18-24 age group are the least likely .
it is not just an act of hoarding by hobbyists , either - it has emotional significance : older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings to themselves ( 56 % versus 53 % ) and enjoy being alone ( 69 % versus 66 % ) .
but are yougov &apos;s results true ?
if this blog was a televised news report , the camera would follow me as i walked down the middle of a busy soho street , wearing a modest grey suit and gesturing wildly before stopping , cupping my hands and saying something authoritative like : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a look . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look .
while the heart of soho is slowly being drained of its charm and grot - hotels , eats , prets and paperchases now fill the buildings once occupied by independent sellers - a handful of fantastic specialist record shops still remain .
i &apos;d probably ask the camera to stop rolling for the next bit , in which i stand very close to various men in some of these stores and attempt to gauge their age and emotional disposition via observation .
glaswegian stuart , 55 , whom i follow from sister ray ( data count : two young women , three middle-aged men ) into reckless records ( data count : eight middle-aged men , one woman , probably in her 20s ) is in london for the afternoon for a meeting and is perusing the shops to fill a few hours .
is he a collector , i ask ?
&quot; i suppose i am , &quot; he says .
i have about 3,000 or 4,000 records .
these records , pictured above ( he emailed me the snap , i didn &apos;t follow him home ) , line his living room walls .
his reason for acquiring such a vast number of albums and singles is partly a result of his disposable income : he is now able to buy records he couldn &apos;t afford when they originally came out , and to repurchase items he sold when he was young and skint .
&quot; a lot of the stuff i get is late 60s , early 70s , things that came out when i was 11 or 12 , things i was probably a bit too young to get , &quot; he says .
he agrees that those who purchase records are more likely to be introverts who like their own company , adding : &quot; i don &apos;t smoke , i don &apos;t drink very much .
it &apos;s my vice .
wez , 25 , who works at sister ray , also believes that many of the customers he encounters fit the yougov profile .
he has , however , noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media hype , people who heard about the comeback and felt compelled to buy back their old records .
from conversations i &apos;ve had , people have got rid of their collection , normally around 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their vinyl to buy cds are now selling their cds to buy their records back , &quot; he says .
that may explain a boom in vinyl revivalists of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional importance of records ?
it takes a few seconds in a shop such as phonica to realise that record stores offer a comforting community of likeminded types .
according to wez , some older customers have taken umbrage with the contactless payment system in particular .
some vinyl fans may feel overwhelmed by the digital world and choose to retreat to the stability of the familiar record sleeve , of items that recall halcyon teenage memories .
&quot; i think sometimes it can be filling a void or having material possessions as some kind of comfort , &quot; wez says .
as a collector myself , i have that , and i think a lot of people do .
it &apos;s an easy way to occupy your headspace .
&quot; we &apos;re like their social workers ! &quot; pipes up a co-worker from a stack of records .
an icm poll in april revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a vinyl album the previous month had yet to listen to it .
the poll also found that 41 % have a turntable they never use , while 7 % of those who purchase vinyl don &apos;t own a record player .
at this stage of the news report , i would probably be looking gravely concerned while flicking through a stack of bossa nova compilations .
the &quot; trophy &quot; aspect of the revival is something that jonny , 42 , who works in sounds of the universe ( data count : three midde-aged men ) has noticed .
&quot; someone came in recently and said : &quot; i don &apos;t have a record player , but i want to buy a radiohead record so we can put it on our shelf , &quot; &quot; he says .
that &apos;s not a large percentage , but it &apos;s definitely happening .
more of the product side , less of the music .
we have people saying : &quot; i don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
that &apos;s younger people , not older ones , late teens who are just getting into it .
fopp , which now dedicates almost an entire floor to vinyl , has a far more varied audience when i arrive .
there are couples in their 70s , tourists taking photos , teenage boys and middle-aged women .
while the atmosphere is less at ease than the aforementioned stores - wild beast &apos;s latest synth- and sex-fuelled pop , rather than noodling jazz , is blasting from the speakers - it is good to see diversity in its customers .
none of them look particularly lonely , but nagging psychological trauma is hard to ascertain by standing next to someone for 30 seconds .
elanora , 27 , has been walking around fopp for a few minutes , looking at the variety of records on sale .
she is window-shopping , rather than on a spending spree .
she doesn &apos;t earn a lot , she says , so collecting records isn &apos;t really an option .
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music by a computer or another way , but the beauty of vinyl is ... &quot; she drifts off into a lovestruck sigh .
i don &apos;t know how to explain - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a shop said to have inspired a fresh generation of vinyl lovers : urban outfitters .
while giving the illusion of perusing the denim hot pants , i observe a group of teenage girls , who cluster around the polaroid cameras momentarily , before a dad and his daughter deliberate purchasing a crosley record player .
to the left is a stairwell , a wall of which is stacked with records by adele , jeff buckley , amy winehouse and fleetwood mac : a mix of contemporary and classics , the essential records for any average collection .
nobody is looking - perhaps because they are merely decoration , some so high up the wall that it would be impossible to touch them .
it is pure &quot; art vinyl . &quot;
but , given that any attraction to these items could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers into the depths of soho for more , there is little to complain about .
it is no surprise that a demographic more likely than most to have more time and money than most is also the one that spends the most on luxury items such as vinyl .
but while my findings suggest yougov &apos;s results are accurate , in soho record stores at least , they do not discount the huge number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in reality , in record shops and on online forums .
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
they are certainly not spending their thursday mornings loitering around the record shops of berwick street , flicking through records and avoiding the gaze of a creepy , 30-year-old fake television presenter who is looming over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men .
greenland shark is longest-living vertebrate animal - video report

french court rejects bid to demolish shops at jungle refugee camp
a french court has rejected a bid by calais authorities to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the jungle camp where thousands of refugees are living .
at a court hearing this week , calais authorities had argued the state should be able to knock down a total of 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell goods , from cigarettes to energy drinks , offer haircuts , or sell tea for 50 cents ( 40p ) or basic meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants .
the calais prefect &apos;s office argued the places should be demolished because they represented a parallel economy that did not pay tax , and because they carried fire and sanitation risks .
humanitarian groups had told the court the shops and restaurants were vital , saying the free meals offered by a state-backed association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing numbers at the camp .
they argued the makeshift shops and restaurants often provided shelter and free meals to those in need .
a lille court ruled there was no legal basis for expelling the people running the 72 makeshift shops , but said the calais prefect &apos;s concerns &quot; were totally understandable . &quot;
the judge , jean-françois molla , said the groceries , cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than simply feeding people that &quot; live in extremely precarious conditions . &quot;
he said the spaces provided calm meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that had been under threat from demolition was the camp &apos;s jungle book kids &quot; cafe which is run not-for-profit and provides 200 meals a day , english and french classes , and asylum advice for the hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp .
more than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the kids &quot; cafe .
a letter sent to the guardian said its closure &quot; would be a catastrophe for these children , some of whom are as young as eight . &quot;
two charities , help refugees and l &apos;auberge des migrants , on friday estimated that numbers in the jungle camp have risen to over 9,000 people - the highest ever - after a steep increase in arrivals during the summer .

britain settle for silver in rugby sevens after fiji masterclass sees them take gold
great britain &apos;s impressive run in the rugby 7s was brought to a crashing halt at the final hurdle by fiji in the final on thursday night when they were comprehensively beaten 43-7 at the deodoro stadium here in rio .
fiji gave a masterclass in handling , off-loading , side-stepping , support play , running lines and brute strength to win gold - their first olympic medal of any colour .
defeat came with the non-too shabby consolation of silver - britain &apos;s third of the day - and they could be proud of their efforts in the inaugural olympic 7s tournament in which they beat new zealand , argentina and south africa along the way .
the bruising beating of the boks , 7-5 in the semi-final earlier in the day , may have come back to bite them in the final .
but , regardless , fiji on this form would have beaten a fit as a fiddle 15-man team .
it may be some consolation to gb - but probably not - that at least one briton will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow : fiji &apos;s head coach is ben ryan , the former england boss from wimbledon .
it has been some journey for gb .
eight years ago , under ryan , they lost every game at the adelaide sevens .
here , they lost just one .
this hammering will hurt but the progress is startling .
fiji started magnificently , bouncing off gb tackles for fun .
it was like running into a series of moving buses for captain tom mitchell and co and the world series champions went 5-0 up when osea kolinisau dived over in the corner .
with four minutes on the clock jerry tuwai added another down the right wing , which was converted .
12-0 and gb had hardly touched the ball .
a superb mitchell tackle stopped the man-mountain leone nakarawa from scoring a third but it was only delaying fiji .
on seven minutes jasa veremalua touched down in the right corner and gb were 17-0 to the bad .
nakarawa added another from the restart and there was still over a minute on the clock ... in the first half .
vatemo ravouvou then burst through some more limp gb tackling and stormed to the line to score .
the conversion made it 29-0 at the break .
it was as if fiji had been born to play 7s , while gb are still learning the trade .
which is pretty much how it is .
gb made wholesale changes at half-time and they plugged the fijian dam ... for all of four minutes , which by first-half standards was good , until josua tuisova went over after some brilliant fijian interplay .
dan norton grabbed a try for gb , touching down in the left corner to make it 36-7 but the game was long gone the way of the south sea islanders whose fans sang , waved flags and danced in the stands .
it was hard not to admire fiji &apos;s whole joyful approach .
mata viliame iced the fijian cake that didn &apos;t need icing with another try in the dying moments .
the whistle went , the fijians embraced and gb hit the turf , thoroughly beaten .
earlier in the day , fiji had beaten japan 20-5 in their semi-final and gb edged south africa in a tight semi-final of one try each - britain &apos;s conversion the difference .
kyle brown put the boks ahead in the first half but dan norton with some dazzling footwork broke the line and scored under the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late tackle from marcus watson , brother of england &apos;s 15-aside team , anthony , secured the win - and ultimately the silver medal .
helen glover and heather stanning inspired to rowing victory by coach &apos;s cancer battle
there will not be a more emotive gold at these games , and that is saying something .
from the first stroke to the last , 220 punishing heaves into history , helen glover and heather stanning found added meaning in their golden moment at the estacio da lagoa .
though they were the two pulling on the oars , there were three voices in that boat , the echo of coach robin williams ever present as they powered to a second successive olympic gold in the women &apos;s pairs , the first females in the annals of british sport to scale such a height .
their dominance was absolute , after all this was their 39th outing unbeaten , again unprecedented .
what we see , two brilliant athletes skating over the surface with the elegance of swans , does not wholly reflect the nature of the triumph .
behind every rowing gold is a battalion of willing hands contributing the incremental gains that make the difference , and no hands were more instrumental than those of a coach who 30 months ago did not know whether he would live to see this day when diagnosed with cancer .
as he said , it was touch and go .
i had bladder cancer which is one of the things they can operate on and they did .
if they don &apos;t it goes everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it alters your outlook a bit .
williams was diagnosed in december 2013 .
the trio were fortunate that he was able to begin his treatment at the start of 2014 out of season , keeping the disruption to a minimum , if that is ever the right expression in circumstances such as these .
i needed to get paid so i had to get better quickly .
it was an incentive .
i was in hospital and i was walking around the ward - 20ft , 30ft 50ft at a time when they were saying a few steps is enough .
that &apos;s how it starts off .
rowing in itself is a journey but that makes it a bit bigger .
in the immediacy of victory their first thoughts were for williams , who had spent a nervy morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to process his own anxieties .
stanning , a captain in the royal artillery regiment with a tour of afghanistan behind her , said &quot; i &apos;ve been an emotional wreck this week , maybe that &apos;s a bit extreme , but it means such a lot . &quot;
it just reiterates how much this means to me , how much me and helen have worked and robin as well .
it &apos;s been a fantastic three years back with helen and robin .
without robin we would be nobody , so a massive thanks to him he &apos;s the best coach in the world .
i couldn &apos;t have asked for a better person to train with , or a better coach .
helen glover and heather stanning haven &apos;t lost a race in five years .
the pair set a punishing rhythm that their rivals could never match .
even in the final 500 metres when the crews from new zealand and denmark began to close , stanning and glover had too much in reserve .
we were very much in the moment .
helen was calling &apos; stay in the process , stay in the process &apos; .
it &apos;s really important not to get carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren &apos;t looking to do anything amazing .
we weren &apos;t looking for fireworks today , we were just looking to do a good row and to go out and win that race , which we did .
the pair will take a year before deciding their futures .
glover has a wedding to attend next month , her own to television adventurer steve backshall .
for now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
i didn &apos;t want to say this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in london it took about six months to realise that i was an olympic champion .
it was all so new and i was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
this feels so much better , &quot; she said .
the government has extended the deadline for the destruction of sanctioned goods
the government has extended the deadline for the destruction of food products prohibited from entering russia until the end of 2017 .
the corresponding decree was signed by prime minister dmitry medvedev and published on the official internet portal for legal information .
the embargo against countries that have imposed anti-russian sanctions over the situation in ukraine was introduced in our country in august 2014 .
subsequently , the ban was repeatedly extended , and is now valid until 31 december 2017 .
in russia , it is prohibited to import certain agricultural products , raw materials , and food from the united states , eu countries , canada , australia , norway , ukraine , albania , montenegro , iceland , and liechtenstein .
in particular , the ban covers meat and meat products , fish , seafood , vegetables , fruits , and dairy products .
the disposal of food products imported into the country in contravention of the embargo has been underway in russia since august 2015 .
just in the first quarter of 2016 , approximately 100 t of prohibited goods have been withdrawn from sale .
on the hunt for ‘ prohibited goods ’
rain and thunderstorms are expected in moscow on friday .
a weather front that will bring precipitation and lower the air temperature will pass through the capital region .
during the day , the air will warm to 25 degrees celsius .
then , overnight into saturday , there will be periods of rain in some areas of moscow , with possible thunderstorms and wind gusts of up to 15 m / s .
during the day , rain with thunderstorms and wind gusts of up to 12-17 m / s are expected .
rain with thunderstorms is also forecast for oryol , kursk , and voronezh regions , dni.ru reports .
precipitation is unlikely for the upcoming workweek .
a wto panel of arbitrators has found that russian import duties on paper , refrigerators , and palm oil contravene the rules of the organisation .
the import rate is in excess of commitments assumed by russia upon accession to the wto .
&apos;this is the first time that the wto has decided against russia &apos; , says a statement on the official website of the organisation .
however , the arbitrators pointed out in their conclusion that the eu has not provided sufficient evidence that russia &apos;s measures ‘ were systematic &apos; or &apos; were overarching in nature &apos; .
russia , in turn , has promised to adjust import duties on paper and refrigerators in the near future .
this is noted in a statement from the russian ministry of economic development and trade .
on 4 july , it was reported that kiev intended to complain to the world trade organisation about russia &apos;s actions , which imposed additional restrictions on the transit of ukrainian goods .
this is stated in a complaint from the government of ukraine .
in may , the financial times wrote that the behaviour of the united states during the resolution of disputes through the wto undermines the organisation &apos;s accepted principles of discussion .
similar statements were made by brazil , japan , the eu , and other wto members , because of the americans &apos; refusal to approve south korean judge , seung wha chang , for a second term .
as a consequence , russia will not make an appeal to the wto regarding the issue of western sanctions introduced against russia .
the wto is an international organisation , founded in january 1995 , for the liberalisation of international trade .
currently , it consists of 162 countries .
russia joined it in 2012 .
the head of the executive office of the president has been replaced
russian president vladimir putin has appointed sergei ivanov &apos;s former deputy , anton vaino , as head of his administration .
vladimir putin carried out the reshuffling of the executive office of the president and expressed hope that the new head of his administration would facilitate the constructive work of the government and the kremlin .
in turn , anton vaino said at the meeting that he considers the anti-corruption measures , which ivanov launched as head of the presidential executive office , to be important , and he promised to cooperate with the government .
earlier , izvestia wrote that experts consider the situation surrounding sergei ivanov &apos;s resignation from the post of head of the administration to be transparent and understandable , and that the reshuffle will not fundamentally change anything in the work of the kremlin administration .
they note that the outgoing head had been working in the presidential administration for a significant period of time and had effectively organised the work of the presidential executive office .
aton vaino , deputy head of the presidential executive office , a person who perfectly understands the specifics of this job , has taken his place .
poland suggests that it will not buy fuel from gazprom .
the state-owned polish oil and gas company , pgnig , has not ruled out the possibility that , in a few years , the supply of gas from russia could become unappealing to it , as a result of a reorientation towards fuel from norway and other countries .
this was announced by bohuslav marzec , vice president of finance for the polish company .
tass quotes him as saying this .
‘ it may just happen that we will no longer buy any gas ( from gazprom ) ; we are currently diversifying our supply .
within the next four years , the main directions of supply for us will be from the east , raw materials from lng terminals , and norway ’ , said marzec .
currently , gazprom occupies the dominant position in gas shipments to poland .
on friday , 12 august , pgnig reported that , in the first half of 2016 , the russian supplier delivered nearly 5.3 billion cubic metres of gas to it , which is 30 % higher than in 2015 .
the russian gas giant &apos;s share in pgnig procurements grew to 49.8 % , compared to 40 % a year earlier .
recall that , on 22 july , poland &apos;s antimonopoly agency denied the creation of a joint venture between gazprom and its european partners for the construction of the nord stream 2 pipeline .
that being said , a month earlier , poland made a request to gazprom for the supply of 11 billion cubic metres of gas through nord stream 2 .
this was stated by alexander medvedev , deputy chairman of the board for the holding .
an auction for the allocation of nord stream 2 capacities will be held in 2017 , and it is planned that an auction for its installation will take place in the autumn of 2016 .
at the end of may , it was reported that gazprom does not plan , as of yet , to take any actions in connection with the intentions of the polish side to withdraw from long-term contracts for the supply of gas from russia after 2022 , stated alexander medvedev , deputy chairman of the board for the company .
he recalled that , in the first quarter of this year , the poles just increased their procurements of gas from the russian federation by 42 % .
the deputy chairman of gazprom added that the mere fact that poland &apos;s pgnig filed a complaint with the stockholm arbitration court does not necessarily mean that negotiations have broken down .
previously , the polish company appealed to the court in order to reduce the purchase price for russian gas .
it bears reminding that the representative of the polish government for issues of gas and energy infrastructure , piotr naimski , said that polish authorities have decided not to extend the gas supply contract with gazprom .
poland &apos;s contract with gazprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022 .
in march , the representative of the polish government for issues of gas and energy infrastructure , piotr naimski , stated that , in six years time , his country could opt out of deliveries of the ‘ blue fuel ’ from the east .
according to him , warsaw is planning to build the baltic pipe , a new lng supply terminal , which will connect the country with the norwegian shelf .
nord stream 2 calls for the construction of two lines of off-shore pipelines running from russia to germany under the baltic sea , with a total capacity of 55 billion cubic metres of gas per year .
the special monitoring mission ( smm ) of the osce has increased the number of observers near the border of ukraine with crimea .
this was announced by principal deputy chief of the smm in ukraine , alexander hug .
&apos;i can confirm that the smm has increased the number of observers in this area &apos; , he said in answer to a corresponding question from journalists , ria novosti reports .
according to the osce , the situation on the border of ukraine and crimea is calm , and there haven &apos;t been any reported incidents affecting security .
observers were monitoring what was happening at three checkpoints on the russian-ukrainian border .
a video of a yak-42 passenger plane , which landed at ufa airport , skidded 400 m off the runway , and fell on its left wing , has appeared online .
the video recording was posted by 360 tv .
the incident occurred at 4 : 30 a.m. moscow time .
the krasavia airline flight was en route from sochi .
they were quickly evacuated to a safe place , and there were no injuries .
the aircraft itself was transported to the apron .
ufa airport is operating as per usual .
the volga district transport investigation department of the investigative committee of russia has begun the process of determining the reason for the liner &apos;s rough landing .
the un is investigating the use of chemical weapons in syria .
a un special commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in rebel-held areas of the syrian city of aleppo .
all parties to the conflict deny using chlorine gas , however , un special envoy for syria , staffan de mistura , considers the fact of what happened to be indisputable .
similar allegations were made just before the third round of inter-syrian talks that should begin in late august in geneva .
un experts have opened an investigation into reports that chemical weapons were used in the syrian city of aleppo .
the first information about a terrorist attack using toxic gas , presumably chlorine gas , appeared on 2 august .
at that time , the opposition said that aircraft dropped bombs with a poisonous substance in the area where a russian military transport helicopter had been shot down the previous day , but moscow deemed these accusations to be utterly false .
later , the russian ministry of defence blamed the opposition group , harakat nour al-din al-zenki , for the incident .
soon thereafter , it came to light that there were two bombs filled with toxic gas .
this was confirmed by one of the victims speaking to bbc .
‘ a few minutes later , i could smell the gas , my eyes started to burn , and it became difficult to breathe ’ , the publication quotes the witness as saying .
at least 7 people were killed and 23 were hospitalised as a result of the attack .
if the use of poison gas is confirmed by experts , the action will be regarded as a war crime .
un special envoy for syria , staffan de mistura , told reporters : ‘ there is a lot of evidence that this actually did take place ’ .
the prohibition of the use of chlorine gas for military purposes is spelled out in the convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons ( cwc ) .
in spite of the fact that all parties to the syrian conflict deny using toxic gases , in 2015 , human rights activists recorded 35 cases of the syrian army using chlorine gas against the ‘ moderate opposition ’ .
the situation in aleppo is complicated by the fact that its districts are being bombarded on a daily basis , and the terrorists are preventing the withdrawal of residents from the city .
according to reuters , the un is waiting for russia to establish a ‘ humanitarian pause ’ in military operations .
the current regime of a daily , three-hour halt to hostilities , in the opinion of the organisation , is ‘ insufficient to help the nearly 2 million civilians who are caught in the trap ’ .
staffan de mistura &apos;s advisor for humanitarian affairs , jan egeland , stated that , in order to deliver aid into the city and evacuate the sick and wounded , a 48-hour cease-fire every week would be required .
‘ we have to send bulk cargo in convoys of trucks into an area where the roads are virtually destroyed and those that remain are mined ’ , reported mr egeland . but the russian delegation has confirmed its readiness to sit down with us at the negotiating table ’ .
in geneva , consultations between representatives of the united states and russia , regarding the establishment of a ‘ humanitarian pause ’ , continue .
how russia opened ‘ humanitarian windows ’ in aleppo .
on 11 august , amidst the ongoing battle for aleppo , the second largest syrian city , russia announced the introduction of a three-hour cessation of hostilities , which will take place daily starting on thursday .
the creation of ‘ humanitarian windows ’ is intended to enable the delivery of medicine , food , and basic necessities into the city .
the decision by the ministry of defence of the russian federation was made in the face of growing international pressure on moscow with requests to scale back the military operation and contribute to the resumption of the negotiation process .
four people were killed as a result of a series of explosions at resorts in thailand .
all at once , several explosions rocked southern thailand on friday morning .
four people were killed and 19 were injured as a result of the attack .
the epicentre of the explosions occurred in the town of hua hin .
ten foreigners , citizens from four states , were among the victims ; there were no russian citizens among them .
none of the terrorist groups have taken responsibility for the incident yet , but the ministry of the interior was quick to declare that the islamists had not been involved in it .
several people have already been detained on suspicion of organising the explosions .
according to preliminary information from the local police , the scale and distinctive features of the explosions indicate that they were directed against the military running the country .
the attacks happened in popular tourist areas such as patong beach in phuket , and in the cities of hua hin , trang , and surat thani .
after the military junta took over control of the country in 2014 , economic growth fell from 7.2 % ( in 2012 ) to 2.8 % ( in 2015 ) , but tourism remained one of the few sectors that was showing growth .
14 million people have already visited the country in 2016 , 1.5 million more than the figure for 2015 .
the first individuals suspected of preparing and organising the attacks have already been detained , reported police colonel krisana patanacharoen .
it &apos;s too early to talk about motives , he added , but the ministry of the interior is &apos; confident that they are not connected to international extremist groups &apos; .
it &apos;s too early to draw conclusions , said mr patanacharoen .
however , we do know that these incidents are not directly linked to any form of terrorism ; in fact , they are acts of local sabotage , and we are trying to establish the identity of those who were behind them .
the explosions took place on the birthday of thailand &apos;s queen sirikit .
the thai junta considers protecting the monarchy one of its main priorities , so the incident was most likely directed against it .
according to statements by police general sithichai srisopacharoenrath , the bombs were remotely detonated within a half hour of each other .
they were hidden within the trees on busy streets , which were filled with tourists having lunch in restaurants .
it is already known that one of the four killed was a young thai woman selling street food .
the identities of the remaining victims are still unknown , but it is known that they are residents of four foreign countries .
according to the royal thai police , they include four citizens of germany , three dutch nationals , two citizens of italy , and one citizen of austria .
there were no russian citizens among the victims of the explosions , the press service of the russian federal tourism agency reported .
local experts have also connected the explosions with the referendum that took place on 7 august , in which 61.4 % of the country &apos;s population supported the new draft constitution .
it was prepared by the constitution drafting committee appointed by the military junta .
voters had to decide if they support a system in which the upper house of the parliament is entirely appointed by the military and has a significant role in electing the prime minister of the country .
the new system was adopted and it will be tested for the first time during the 2017 parliamentary elections .
recall that , on 22 may 2014 , a military coup took place in thailand under the leadership of the commander of the country &apos;s army , prayuth chan-ocha .
according to him , the army was prompted to take this step by the ongoing political crisis and the lack of progress in negotiations between the government and the opposition .
the military created the national council for peace and order , imposed a curfew and censorship , dispersed protesters , and dismissed the upper house of parliament .
how bangkok ended up in a state of emergency
in january 2014 , the government of thailand , led by prime minister yingluck shinawatra , announced the imposition of a state of emergency in bangkok and the provinces surrounding the capital .
the special security arrangement lasted for 60 days .
how two explosions rocked bangkok .
in january 2014 , in the heart of bangkok , two explosions occurred at the victory monument , which was one of the main sites of the protest , and as a consequence , 28 people were injured and five of them were in critical condition .
the explosions were carried out by unidentified individuals on motorcycles .
the authorities increased security measures in the capital and brought in military forces to protect demonstrators .
the development of terms has begun in sukhoi log .
kommersant has learned that the government has been asked to approve a proposal for the terms of an auction for the gold deposit , sukhoi log , while preserving two key restrictions .
it is proposed to bar from the auction companies that are 25 % or more foreign-owned and those bidders whose capital will not consist of at least 25 % state participation .
industry insiders aren &apos;t expecting the government to rewrite the terms , noting that there are already many players that won &apos;t risk taking on the complex and expensive project .
they could announce the auction in august and hold it in october .
the ministry of natural resources and environment has submitted to the government a draft of the regulation and auction terms for the world &apos;s largest undeveloped gold deposit in russia , sukhoi log ( irkutsk region , with 130 million ounces in reserves and resources ) , said two of kommersant &apos;s sources who are familiar with the situation .
the draft was submitted on wednesday evening , one of them elaborated .
the ministry of natural resources and environment confirmed to kommersant that the draft was submitted to the government .
the representative in charge of subsoil use , deputy prime minister alexander khloponin , told kommersant that the official &apos;s administrative office has not yet received the draft .
‘ the auction could be announced as early as august , immediately after a government order is issued , and given the timeframe for the submission of applications from potential participants ( at least 45 days ) , the tender could take place as early as october ’ , the ministry of natural resources and environment said .
according to kommersant , two key requirements for potential participants were preserved in the wording of the version of the draft that was submitted for approval to the ministries and the federal executive authority in july ( kommersant has a copy ) .
the first is that bidders must have a minimum of 25 % state participation in their capital .
the second is that companies under the control of foreign investors are denied access to the auction , based on an understanding of federal law no.57 on investments in strategic entities .
according to the two articles of the federal law mentioned in the draft , which kommersant already wrote about on 2 august , companies whose beneficiaries ( a 25 % share and higher ) are not tax residents of russia or who have dual citizenship need not be permitted access to the auction .
the government has the right to impose such restrictions , given that sukhoi log is classified as a federal-status mineral resource ( reserves of over 50 tonnes of gold ) .
the ministry of natural resources and environment confirmed that the draft &apos; contains restrictions on the participation of foreign companies ’ , but declined to comment on the details in advance of the government order .
the requirement of state participation in the capital of auction participants was proposed by irkutsk region , the ministry of natural resources and environment told kommersant in december 2015 , which was later confirmed by the region &apos;s governor , sergei levchenko , noting that it had been sent to the ministry of natural resources and environment by his predecessor , sergei eroschenko , ‘ who had an agreement on investment projects with rostec ’ .
kommersant &apos;s sources did not specify who lobbied for the restriction on the participation of foreigners .
‘ but this is in the spirit of the times : to not hand over control of the largest gold deposits in russia amidst western sanctions ’ , argues a kommersant source familiar with the auction ’ s preparations .
on 1 august , minister of natural resources and environment , sergei donskoy , said that foreigners ‘ can enter into a consortium ’ , if bidders invite them to participate ‘ in the capacity of a financial structure and as technology partners ’ .
kommersant &apos;s sources consider it highly unlikely the government will adjust the terms .
the industry front-runner for sukhoi log is believed to be a consortium of the largest gold mining company in the russian federation , pjsc polyus ( which is controlled by suleiman kerimov &apos;s son , said ) , and rostec .
as kommersant wrote , in july , the partners established a joint venture , cl gold , which gives polyus 51 % of the shares , and the structure , rostec rt-global resources , 49 % .
rostec declined to comment , while polyus told kommersant that ‘ definitely , they are interested in the asset ’ and possess all the necessary expertise and resources for its development .
‘ but a final decision on the feasibility and form of our participation will be made after the announcement of terms ’ , polyus added .
alrosa might participate in the auction , but the decision is up to the government of the russian federation , said kommersant &apos;s sources .
russia &apos;s gv gold and canada &apos;s kinross gold , which is developing assets in chukotka region , have also announced the possibility of participating in the development of sukhoi log , while polymetal and nordgold , according to kommersant , are not interested in the asset .
sergei kashuba , chairman of the russian union of gold producers , told kommersant in december 2015 , that investments in sukhoi log were valued at between $ 2.5 and 4 billion .
the majority of potential bidders are deterred not only by the investment amount , but also by the complexity of the project : extensive in-mine exploration of reserves and methods for working with complex ores are required , kommersant &apos;s sources in the industry explain .
the largest m &amp; a deal in the pension market has gotten underway : kit finance pension administrator has launched the process of combining four non-state pension funds ( npf ) under its control .
as a result , an npf with savings of around 373 billion roubles will be created on the basis of gazfond pension savings .
the launch of the merger of the four pension funds – kit finance , promagrofond , nasledie , and gazfond pension savings – was reported yesterday by the 100 % owner of the funds , kit finance pension administrator , llc .
‘ the reorganisation is being carried out in coordination with the central bank , and in compliance with the requirement that there be no deterioration in the terms of existing contracts ’ , says a company statement .
the merger is being carried out on the basis of gazfond pension savings .
as noted by the ceo of this npf , oleg byaloshitsky , the merging of the funds makes it possible to solve several problems : expand geographical presence , pool resources for development , reduce costs , replicate the best practices of each of the funds , and improve corporate management .
according to him , the approximate completion date for the consolidation is the second quarter of 2017 .
as a result of the merger , npf gazfond pension savings will become the largest player in the compulsory pension insurance market .
as of 31 march , the volume of pension savings of the merging funds exceeded 373 billion roubles .
based on the financials on the website of the funds , anatoly gavrilenko ( who owns 65 % through a controlled llc ) and npf gazfond ( 35 % ) are the current beneficiaries of their owner , kit finance pension administrator .
however , the merger of this group was launched much later than its competitors .
for example , npf future , under the control of o1 group , absorbed stalfond back at the beginning of this year .
currently , this combined npf is absorbing the uralsib and russian standard funds .
‘ merging into a single structure , in addition to reducing costs , is necessary for solving structural problems ’ , notes the ceo of npf future , nikolay sidorov .
the safmar pension group has been engaged in active efforts aimed at consolidating funds since april : the european , education and science , and regionfond npfs should join the ranks of npf safmar by the end of this year .
in 2017 , npf doverie will join them .
‘ merging the funds will have the effect of improving risk control , operational processes , and costs ’ , the safmar pension group noted .
the pause in merging funds that kit finance pension administrator took could have been caused by several factors , experts say .
until recently , npfs could not redeem more than 40 % of the volume of an issue of infrastructure bonds in which the group was actively involved .
after amendments were made to the central bank resolution in march of this year , there are no longer any such restrictions for a number of issuers that meet the requirements of the regulator .
if necessary , an entire issue can be redeemed by one big player ’ , says yury nogin , director of the financial institutions ratings group at acra .
several heads of the top-15 npfs by assets named the division of spheres of influence , and , as a result , the appointment of staff in a single fund , which had to be agreed to by the owners of the group , as yet another possible reason for the pause .
yesterday , anatoly gavrilenko could not be reached for comment .
npf gazfond also did not respond to kommersant &apos;s request .
although the consolidation of funds is a time-consuming and expensive affair , this decision will be justified in the long run .
sergei kolesnov , ceo of the consulting firm , pension partner , notes that gazfond pension savings has fewer outflows , so the accession will help to stabilise the base of the group &apos;s other funds .
moreover , the successful experience of npfs , kit finance and promagrofond , in generating retail sales of compulsory pension insurance and in using more modern software , will be in demand .
the central bank &apos;s requirements for the activities and personnel of npfs are constantly growing , so it is impractical to duplicate the infrastructure of the four funds given their unified investment policy , says pavel mitrofanov , managing director of corporate ratings at expert ra .
‘ the effect of cutting out duplicate functions will definitely cover the potential costs of the merger ’ , notes mr mitrofanov .
sergei okolesnov estimates the cost of merging the four funds at between 30-50 million roubles .
‘ the cost of maintaining four funds of these sizes amounts to about 400 million roubles a year , so , in the medium term , the consolidation will actually cut the budget by half ’ , mr okolesnov assured .
the kindest disney film , ‘ pete &apos;s dragon ’ , has been released in russia .
the beautiful views of new zealand , the adorable dragon , the sentimental story , and the country music songs are enough to make one believe in good old-fashioned magic once again , says elena kravtsun .
the dragon finds the frightened boy , becoming both a gentle caregiver and loyal friend to the young human .
pete calls his friend elliot , in honour of a puppy from a book of fairy tales , plays tag with him , and falls asleep in his embrace .
six years later , with a beard and in a loincloth , he is indistinguishable from that other clever forest rascal , mowgli .
it is in this state that he is found by the redheaded huntress , grace ( bryce dallas howard ) , while a team led by gavin ( karl urban ) , the brother of her husband , is aggressively clearing the forest .
now , she is faced not only with believing that the dragon exists , but also with helping to save him .
pete goes through a crash course in ‘ being human ’ , surrounded by idyllic americans who wear cowboy shirts , live according to a moral code , and smile more brightly than in any advertising .
none of the characters look or act too horribly for the audience to really start to hate or fear them .
even gavin , who unleashes a hunt for the unusual inhabitant of the woods under his control , is far from an incorrigible villain .
the huge fluffy dragon also turned out to be anything but frightening , with the sweet muzzle of a bulldog , the wingspan of an airplane , and the power of invisibility .
the dragon amusingly grunts , purrs , and even snorts , but , thankfully , does not speak ; although , the whole time , you want to be petting him , and it is in this sense that he has an obvious advantage over all the other known cinematic dragons .
the visual representation of elliot and his mannerisms create such a high degree of emotional involvement that , in the most intense moments , it &apos;s not only the young members of the audience who start desperately bawling their eyes out , but also the adults .
the young oakes fegley is also surprisingly good in the role of pete : torn between his potential family and a true friend .
while robert redford masterfully plays the iconic grandfather , whom literally every child would be glad to have .
how did director david lowery manage to shoot a fantastically lovable remake of the forgotten disney film , ‘ pete &apos;s dragon ’ ( 1977 ) , – which was mediocre from start to finish and only remembered for combining animation and live-action film – and turn it into this summer &apos;s most heartwarming film ?
nothing short of a miracle would have helped .
lowry , in fact , only took two things from the original for his film : the orphan pete and the dragon .
the musical numbers and most of the odd jokes were thrown overboard .
features drawn from ‘ bambi ’ , ‘ e.t. ’ , and many other cherished children &apos;s films can be seen in this kind-hearted tale .
disney studios continues to successfully expand their gallery of high-quality 21st century remakes .
of course , ‘ pete &apos;s dragon ’ is not as stunningly beautiful as ‘ the jungle book ’ , and there is no cunning villain , such as cate blanchett turned out to be in the role of the stepmother in the new ‘ cinderella ’ .
but this simple-hearted film , in keeping with the best traditions of disney , is no less successful in helping one to believe in miracles and goodness .
in fact , director lowry will get the keys to disney &apos;s magic castle once again for an artistic film adaptation of the story of ‘ peter pan ’ .
the tandem of david lowery and screenwriter toby halbrooks , tried and tested during ‘ pete &apos;s dragon ’ , has entered into an ambitious new project about the boy who never grew up from james barrie &apos;s fairy tale by the same name .
a new charge will be brought against rbc journalist alexander sokolov
lawyers for the rbc journalist , alexander sokolov , accused of organising an extremist organisation , reported that the prosecutor &apos;s office found mistakes in the case against their client .
we only learned that the prosecutor &apos;s office had made such a recommendation from investigators yesterday .
we were scheduled to participate in a court hearing regarding restrictions on familiarisation with the materials of the criminal case , but the hearing never actually took place , and then the investigators informed us of the recommendation issued by the prosecutor &apos;s office ’ , rbc quotes lawyer , olga dinze , as saying .
she related that the prosecutor &apos;s office pointed out to the investigators the discrepancy between the classification of the case and the materials collected .
now , investigators will have to bridge the gaps in the body of evidence and bring a new charge against alexander sokolov .
either the case will fall under a different section of the criminal code ( cc ) , or it will stay the same , but with different arguments and new evidence , ms dinze clarifies .
as kommersant reported , alexander sokolov was arrested on 29 july 2015 .
in june of this year , it was reported that the investigation excluded the rbc journalist from a charge worded as ‘ undermining the stability of political environment ’ and ‘ overthrowing the government by illegal means ’ .
kommersant-boscosport correspondent , alexander zilbert , lived the life of an olympic athlete in the olympic village , inspected team russia house , had lunch at the on-site cafeteria , and , after all of this , even passed a wada test .
it seems that life here never stops for a second .
even at night .
the last events sometimes end after midnight , after which the athletes still need about one and a half to two hours to return to the olympic village .
furthermore , people are constantly checking-in and checking-out of the village , as some athletes leave brazil after finishing their competitions , while others , on the contrary , have only just arrived here .
well , it &apos;s only 7 : 30 a.m. and all of the heads of the olympic delegations are crammed into one of the temporary tents .
we usually discuss certain mundane operational issues at these meetings , recounts igor kazikov , head of the sports delegation of the russian olympic team . in spite of the fact that the building where our people have been housed is considered to be a showpiece – it was one of the first to be commissioned and was shown to all the inspectors – even here , certain deficiencies are constantly being found .
one day there &apos;s a problem with the hot water , and the next day it &apos;s , excuse me , the toilets .
we struggled with issues of cleanliness for a long time .
at first , no one was even showing up to clean .
then , the cleaners started to show up , but only to spray some kind of substance on the floor , and that was all .
their floors , can &apos;t you see , are somehow innovative .
supposedly you can &apos;t wash them like a normal person .
sure , we know these kinds of floors : ordinary laminate flooring !
in sum , we successfully managed to switch cleaning companies and now everything seems to be ok with this .
the olympic village is like yuzhnoe butovo , a residential district fenced in by mountains on one side and on the other sides , there is an impressive ditch filled here and there with water .
well , for security , there is also a two-metre iron fence around the whole perimeter , along which guards , armed with automatic weapons , stroll .
in total , the village can accommodate up to 17,000 people in 3,604 apartments , located inside 31 buildings .
a massive russian flag hangs on one of these 18-storey buildings : this building has been totally handed-over for use by our team .
taking a glance at the small foyer by the entrance , you can immediately identify the problems that are apparently the most pressing for our home team .
two notices are hanging at the front desk : a printed one , ‘ please , do not throw paper in the toilet ! ’ , and a hand-written one , ‘ i will accept pins as gifts ’ .
the front desk itself is buried under pamphlets .
their cheerful colours contrast with the titles of the brochures : ‘ a guide to infectious diseases for travellers to rio de janeiro ’ ; ‘ first aid for drowning , choking on a foreign object , loss of consciousness - the steps of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation ’ ; and ‘ first aid for burns , heat stroke , fractures , and bleeding ’ .
the inside text is , generally speaking , reassuring .
for example , this one : ‘ the infection is accompanied by fever and subsequent recovery .
however , not everyone can expect a favourable outcome .
of course , team russia has a medical centre at its disposal , which is always ready to provide residents of the house with professional assistance , including relaxation and sports massage .
across from the medical centre is our delegation &apos;s headquarters .
next to the door , there is an inspirational poster : ‘ in spite of everything , we shall prevail ! ’ .
and , of course , there is poetry :
all the arguments are absolute nonsense !
they are only believed by those who are afraid .
the fewer of us there are , the sweeter the taste of victory : russia will not back down and will not be broken !
and to further raise one &apos;s spirits , there hangs an announcement : ‘ dear brothers and sisters !
with the blessing of his holiness patriarch kirill of moscow and all russia , archpriest andrei vladimirovich alexeev will perform spiritual care for the athletes of the russian olympic team .
prayer service and other religious rites can be ordered by phone ...
in fact , there is a centre for meditation and religious ceremonies for representatives of all faiths within the village .
while russians , it turns out , are given special treatment : they have their own chapel .
in light of congestion on the elevator between the ninth and the fourth floors , i decided to go down the stairs that are recommended for use during a fire .
and , in the darkness , i stumbled over bodies laying down on them .
by all accounts , it was the staff from the new cleaning company sleeping .
on the ready , i dare say , at any moment to rush to wash the innovative floors , they had decided to arrange a naptime for themselves directly on the cold steps .
on the fourth floor , i had a meeting with a long-time acquaintance , vitaly fedorovich dubko , the coach for our trampolinists , who led them to olympic gold , 16 years ago already , in sydney .
he and his pupil , european champion , yana pavlova , kindly agreed to show their rooms .
by and large , there is nothing to complain about , the honoured coach of russia shares his impressions . we live two to a room , the beds , of course , are almost right up against each other , but it &apos;s not critical .
there is one bathroom for four people , but at least it &apos;s spacious .
of course , the wardrobe is laughable ; it &apos;s made of cloth and doesn &apos;t inspire a lot of confidence , but things can be put in it .
‘ no , well , can you imagine it ? they &apos;ve run out of tea ! ’ , tennis player , svetlana kuznetsova , who met me in the main dining room , says while throwing her hands up in dismay .
it &apos;s called the main dining room if for no other reason than the fact that it provides 2,7 thousand square meters of space and is ready to accommodate 5 thousand visitors at one time .
here , they produce 60 thousand servings a day absolutely free of charge .
the menu options include : ‘ the best of brazil ’ , ‘ global cuisine ’ , ‘ asian dishes ’ , and ‘ pizza and pasta ’ .
the last option , as i noticed , is very popular with our volleyball players .
having said that , i couldn &apos;t find soup , for example , in any one of the areas of the giant restaurant .
who cares about soup ? , kuznetsova says in astonishment , there &apos;s no tea !
it &apos;s a good thing i brought some chinese tea to brew with me .
and a teapot .
but , in general , just so you understand , the food at the tennis courts is even worse .
here , there is at least something to choose , despite the unbearable monotony .
i personally chose the steamed cod and meatballs in tomato sauce .
a sign is situated beside each dish with its name in three languages – english , french , and portuguese – and it also shows the nutritional value of the item and the presence of allergens .
and well , i must confess , it was entirely edible .
i don &apos;t even understand why there is always such a queue at the local mcdonald &apos;s .
the well-fed , relaxed , and , in a manner of speaking , ‘ food drunk ’ athletes are awaited at the restaurant exit by our best friends : representatives from the world anti-doping agency ( wada ) .
they cleverly entice with a quiz , the winner of which will receive a tee-shirt .
they &apos;re luring them in , you could say !
to get a gift , you have to correctly answer at least eight out of ten questions .
a girl from wada ambushed me with ‘ there are questions in russian ! ’ .
but she didn &apos;t ambush the right person .
that is to say , i harnessed my patriotic impulse , of course .
the situation already took a turn for the worse by the second question : ‘ if i received a notification to report to doping control , should i report immediately to the doping control centre ? ’
i settled on option b : ‘ no , i have one hour ’ .
i was caught , how to say , off guard .
i forgot that there &apos;s no sense in waiting for a break from wada .
essentially , you need to report immediately .
well , by the seventh stage of the quiz , my situation had become entirely critical .
for some reason , i thought that if i was having a hard time sticking to a balanced diet because of my busy schedule ( and , by the way , it is hard for me ! ) , i could use dietary supplements to get ‘ extra nutrients to enhance my performance ’ .
but alas , they won &apos;t allow it !
to be more precise , the answer is formulated in such a way that they don &apos;t outright forbid it , but rather , in a few sentences , strongly advise against it .
that wada doesn &apos;t play fair !
‘ so , how &apos;s it going , russia ? ’ , the presenter of the quiz mockingly questions .
there was nowhere to hide : behind me were efimova , isinbayeva , and the rest of our depleted team .
so i buckled down and , using my last ounce of strength , won that pitiful tee-shirt .
as the saying goes , let them see what we &apos;re made of !
in a triumphant mood , i wandered into the nearby fitness centre .
i got caught up with counting the fitness machines .
i lost track at 250 .
i noted with surprise that there was not a single russian athlete to be found among this mass of treadmills .
but maybe that &apos;s the way it should be ?
let those who don &apos;t know how to play be the ones who train !
however , one of our boys was sitting at the medical clinic located nearby .
in line to see the optometrist .
don &apos;t worry ; he &apos;s not a shooter .
at the clinic , and for that matter , as with everywhere else you look throughout the village , hangs a device for distributing condoms .
it is inscribed with an inspiring appeal : ‘ celebrate with a condom ! ’
then , you just have to turn a piece of metal resembling the knob of a door lock , and a condom , made of natural latex from the amazon , readily falls from the device .
i took one for myself , as a memento .
the athletes won &apos;t miss it ; they brought in 450 thousand of these for them .
in fact , the olympic village has a whole recreation centre for celebratory and leisurely pursuits .
beside it , for good measure , there is an informative plaque , reminding that the international olympic committee , in various ways , is spending $ 3.25 million on the athletes per day .
the centre is inundated with video games , billiards , ping-pong tables , foosball and air hockey tables , and some odd equipment that looks like video training simulators .
‘ what is that ? ’ , i ask a comrade in a ukrainian team uniform , who is actively using the strange toy .
of course , he could have just said that he didn &apos;t want to talk to someone in a team russia uniform , and that would have been that .
here , incidentally , by some sort of strange set of circumstances , my eyes are sore from all these boys in yellow and blue .
a team that never stops playing around , it turns out .
it takes no less than three hours to walk around the whole village , exploring every nook and cranny .
but , if you walk and don &apos;t get a ride in the electric cars , you will discover team canada house with a moose at the entrance and a pavilion with a restorative bath , and a ticket office , and a laundromat , and a dry cleaners , and a hair salon , and a flower shop , and a shop with everyday goods , and a post office with unique stamps ( only you won &apos;t be able to wait out the queue of chinese stamp collectors anyways ) , and a bank , and a lost and found , and a photo booth .
and in the late evening you , exhausted , will sit down beside an olive tree , decorated with multicoloured ribbons in memory of the athletes &apos; dearly departed friends and relatives .
and you , to the accompaniment of a device randomly spraying a liquid to kill insects , will think about eternity .
that is to say , about the olympic movement .
which , in this village , doesn &apos;t stop even for a minute .
while the rest of the russian world watched with bated breath as the australians came close to trouncing the american dream team , the real fans went online .
few people know that i was the first to receive the news that inna deriglazova had won gold in foil fencing at the xxxi olympic games .
i may even be the only muscovite who saw how it unfolded , except , of course , for those who were watching the competition that night in carioca .
only a true fan could understand .
just imagine : it &apos;s the dead of the night in moscow .
the neighbours downstairs , as per usual , wake up by 1 a.m. and start amicably , but very loudly , shouting at each other .
and threateningly moving the furniture .
in the kitchen , the faucet is leaking : there hasn &apos;t been time to drive to the market and buy a new one like the plumber requested .
the tv schedule makes no sense , so i just kept an eye on the channels , match , first , and , just in case , russia , although that &apos;s almost pointless .
russia channel is the birthplace of reruns : all the sports on there are prerecorded for some reason .
tv series are broadcast live on there .
i , of course , was counting on match : the whole evening the young man on the news broadcasts had been shouting first about the great semi-final between deriglazova and shanaeva , and then about the impending battle for the gold .
it would have made sense to show it .
but instead of this , it was basketball between the usa and australia .
by the way , i can &apos;t say anything bad about this decision .
the australians were an equal match , and , as a matter of fact , they won the first half .
they put the americans , deluded by grandeur , in their place .
they still lost in the end , but , like they &apos;re now saying , the olympic basketball tournament will never be the same again .
that &apos;s all well and good , but the bout with di francisca is drawing near and nothing is changing on the screen .
i start flipping through the channels in a slight panic .
it feels like they are playing it for the second time in a row .
fine , we &apos;ll dig deeper and check the cable channels .
there is no fencing on any of the specialty match channels .
but , i have a feeling that the bout is just about to start .
i &apos;m not interested in settling for the text and twitter broadcasts of some sports websites .
the spastic channel surfing produces an unexpected but brilliant result .
it turns out that the first channel website broadcasts the technical videostream of all events in real time .
i click on fencing and get the battle for the gold .
deriglazova mounts a terrific counterattack , moves ahead in points , and , quite obviously , starts to run out the clock .
the italian claws back almost all of the lead .
our girl is one point ahead with just a little more than two seconds to go .
di francisca lunges at deriglazova and the latter retreats ; time is running out and the italian makes a play .
victory !
a few seconds later , the olympic messenger on my phone notifies me of the fourth gold medal .
as it turns out , i am the first to see it with my own eyes .
my crazy , loyal , involved eyes .
the muslim religious board ( mrb ) of tatarstan renounces the use the russian language in mosques .
yesterday , a plenum of the mrb ordered their imams to lead friday sermons in tatar only , to force young tatars ‘ to learn their native language ’ .
the administrative body states that this ‘ in no way infringes ’ on the rights of muslims of other ethnicities .
several of the mosques in kazan have complained that the tatar language is not understood by up to 60 % of worshippers , such as foreign students , migrants , and even tatars themselves .
the imams fear that their sermons in tatar ‘ won &apos;t reach the entire audience ’ .
yesterday , a plenum of the mrb of tatarstan unanimously adopted a decision to hold friday sermons in the republic &apos;s mosques in the tatar language only .
as stated by the mufti of tatarstan , kamil samigullin , this should become an incentive to young tatars ‘ to learn their native language ’ .
‘ for those who will say that it is “ difficult ” , we intend to organise absolutely free tatar language lessons at each of the large mosques ’ , mr samigullin promised .
he added that ‘ the decision has already come into force ’ , and , today , sermons in all mosques ‘ should already be in the tatar language ’ .
he reminded that the mrb of tatarstan publishes the journal , ‘ shura ’ , with typical sermons in the tatar language .
an imam , who does not speak tatar well enough , ‘ can use them to thoroughly prepare ’ .
the mrb of tatarstan unites more than a thousand congregations throughout all the municipalities of the republic .
according to the mufti , in the regions , friday sermons are conducted exclusively in the tatar language .
on the other hand , a number of mosques in kazan previously had been predominantly using the russian language .
in particular , as indicated by the mufti , this was the practice at burnaevskaya mosque , zakabannaya mosque , and at ‘ eniler ’ .
however , mr mukhametshin emphasised that the leadership has made it an objective that all students are proficient in both official languages of the republic , regardless of ethnicity .
‘ this has absolutely nothing to do with infringing on the rights of non-tatar muslims ’ , emphasised mr mukhametshin , explaining that the sermon itself ‘ is not a mandatory main part of namaz ’ .
in fact , the namaz itself will still be read in arabic , and lectures and lessons at mosques will still be available in the russian language .
at the same time , rafik mukhametshin told kommersant that there was never a serious threat of the tatar language vanishing from mosques .
except for russian and tatar , no other languages , according to him , such as uzbek or tajik , are used in sermons in the republic .
the decision by the mrb was actively supported by the executive committee of the world congress of tatars ( wct ) .
chairman of the executive committee of the wct , rinat zakirov , told kommersant : ‘ the mosque is an important part of our national life ’ .
it would be a shame if the tatar language were to disappear from this sphere .
he noted that conducting sermons in the tatar language only , ‘ is the will of the imams themselves ’ , but that the executive committee of the wct ‘ considers this to be the right decision ’ .
the imams interviewed by kommersant who were conducting sermons in russian , are ready to follow the decision by mrb , however , they believe that the congregation will have difficulty understanding the clerics .
both tatars and russians attend mosque .
many don &apos;t understand the language .
of course , it &apos;s going to be a bit difficult for them .
‘ we &apos;re going to have to change our ways ’ , says the imam of burnaevskaya mosque , farhat mavletdinov .
according to him , even many tatars have a closer affinity to sermons in the russian language , since ‘ russian is what is in schools and in child care facilities , on the radio , and everywhere , from the very beginning ’ .
however , he is under the impression that the mosque will be able to continue lessons and lectures in the russian language , which are held on other days .
we have faith in allah .
allah will show us the way out of this situation ’ , he concluded .
but we have around 60 % that don &apos;t know the tatar language .
these are uzbeks and tajiks and azerbaijanis .
a lot of foreign students come to us : africans , arabs .
‘ that is why we switched to the russian language four years ago ’ , the imam says .
he believes that sermons in the tatar language will ‘ reach a more limited group and will not reach the whole audience ’ .
but we will abide by the decision of the plenum .
simply , the results of the sermons will be different .
but time will tell .
‘ for example , it will only be easier for me , because tatar is my native language ’ , concluded gabdulla galiullin .
the former director of the federal penitentiary service ( fsin ) has been taken to court
the moscow prosecutor &apos;s office has approved an indictment in a criminal case , investigated by the main investigations directorate of the investigative committee of the russian federation , concerning the embezzlement of budgetary funds allocated for use by the fsin of russia .
the former head of the prison service , alexander reimer , and his deputy , will appear before the court , having inflicted damages to the fsin in an amount of more than 2.7 billion roubles .
the capital ’ s prosecutor &apos;s office referred the criminal case against the former director of the fsin of russia , alexander reimer , his former deputy , nikolai krivolapov , as well as the director of the federal state unitary enterprise ( fsue ) , centre for information technology and communications of the federal penitentiary service ( tsitos ) , victor opredelenov , to the zamoskvoretsky district court .
depending on their role and degree of participation in the crimes , they are accused by the main investigations directorate of the investigative committee of the russian federation for moscow under article 285 ( 3 ) of the criminal code of the russian federation ( abuse of official powers entailing grave consequences ) , and article 159 ( 4 ) of the criminal code of the russian federation ( fraud committed using one &apos;s official position , in an organised group , on an especially large scale ) .
furthermore , krivolapov is charged under article 222 ( 1 ) of the criminal code of the russian federation ( illegal acquisition and storage of ammunition ) .
according to the investigative committee of the russian federation , between 2010 and 2012 , the indicated persons fraudulently stole budgetary funds from the state treasury that were allocated to the fsin to provide the agency with electronic monitoring systems for controlled individuals , otherwise known as electronic ankle bracelets .
to embezzle the budgetary funds , the members of the group developed a scheme whereby fsue tsitos , an enterprise controlled by them and with whom relevant government contracts were signed , handled the technical means of control and surveillance , including ‘ electronic bracelets ’ , and charged prices that were inflated several times over .
in spite of the fact that fsue tsitos had no production equipment , buildings , or structures to house the production facilities necessary to create a complete production cycle for ‘ electronic bracelets ’ , five contracts worth more than 3.3 billion roubles were signed between it and the fsin of russia .
as a result of this scheme , more than 2 billion roubles ended up in the accounts of the samara branch of the fsue , of which 1.2 billion roubles were stolen .
as suggested by the investigation , more than 140 million roubles of the cashed money was personally received by mr reimer in his official office from one of the accomplices , whose criminal case was severed .
ammunition , obtained from an unknown source for a special service award gun , was found in the possession of nikolai krivolapov , who was involved in the fraud , which resulted in the laying of additional charges against him .
in regards to this case , the size of which amounted to 133 tomes , fsin has filed a lawsuit against the accused for compensation of material damages in the amount of 2.7 billion roubles .
footballer hakan Şükür is suspected of involvement in the coup .
turkish authorities have issued an arrest warrant for hakan Şükür , a former football player and then a member of parliament , and have carried out searches at his family &apos;s two houses .
a star of turkish football in the 1990s and early 2000s , striker hakan Şükür is wanted by authorities in connection with the coup attempt that took place last month .
the forward , who ended his sports career in 2008 , is accused of belonging to ‘ an armed terrorist group ’ .
this is in reference to the hizmet movement : a society associated with the well-known turkish religious and opposition leader , fethullah gülen .
this is whom president erdogan considers to be the organiser of the military coup attempt that occurred on 15 july .
fethullah gülen lives in the united states , and turkish authorities are demanding his extradition .
according to local media , today , an arrest warrant was issued for hakan Şükür , and police have already carried out searches at the two houses that belong to the family of the former football player .
according to investigators , in addition to hakan Şükür , his father was also part of fethullah gülen &apos;s organisation .
however , neither the former football player , nor his relatives were there .
currently , he and his family are living in the united states .
as a football player , hakan Şükür defended the colours of several turkish clubs and played for the national team .
he spent the better part of his career with galatasaray .
the list of foreign clubs includes italy &apos;s torino , inter , and palermo , as well as england &apos;s blackburn .
although , he never spent more than one season with any of them .
hakan Şükür still holds the title for highest-scoring striker on turkey &apos;s national team : he has 112 matches for the national team under his belt and scored 51 goals .
in 2013 , hakan Şükür resigned from his parliamentary post as a result of the initiation of corruption investigations surrounding erdogan &apos;s party and his inner circle .
according to the turkish newspaper , hurriyet , on 25 july , arrest warrants were issued for at least 42 journalists in turkey .
they are accused of aiding the military coup and having ties to the oppositionist islamic preacher , fethullah gülen , who is living in the united states .
given the gravity of the charges , these members of the media can expect lengthy prison sentences ranging from ten years to several life sentences .
egor konchalovsky wants to create a chain of cinemas that are only for domestic films .
‘ i would create a chain of cinemas that are exclusively for russian films , and the tickets would cost 2-3 times less than for foreign-produced films ’ , he said .
mr konchalovsky notes that it is difficult for russian films to compete with major hollywood films for viewership .
more than 100 films are made in our country each year , but , on average , only 20-25 films make it to the screen .
‘ and it &apos;s even very difficult for them to compete with “ transformers ” and “ iron man ” , the promotion of which are pumped up with huge budgets ’ , the film director said .
it bears reminding that , on 1 july , the tavrida all-russian educational youth forum started working in crimea .
the participants include teachers of creative professions and young professionals from various creative fields and disciplines of the humanities from all over russia and countries of the near and far abroad .

russian copper company ( rmk ) is ready to take on social responsibility and pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business .
this is evidenced , for example , by the fact that rmk took on the modernisation of one of the country ’ s oldest and most ecologically ‘ dirty ’ enterprises : the karabash copper smelter .
the karabash copper smelter was founded by an english joint-stock company , headed by leslie urquhart , in 1910 .
in soviet times , it was an industrial enterprise significant to the country &apos;s economy and effectively ensured the livelihoods of the entire city .
however , in the 1990s , as a result of financial problems , production was stopped , which led to serious social problems in karabash .
in 1998 , a decision was made to resume operations at karabash copper smelter .
it was also critical to solve one of the main problems at the karabash plant : the environmental issue .
by the early 2000s , karabash was already infamous as an ecological disaster zone .
the situation at karabashmed started to change in 2004 , after the enterprise came under the management of russian copper company .
the company started to modernise production , which gradually began to reduce the ecological burden on the environment .
this was recently noted by boris dubrovsky , governor of chelyabinsk region , who visited karabashmed in the first days of july .
the head of the southern urals called the changes that have taken place at the plant , since karabashmed became a part of the rmk group , grandiose .
in recent years , the flagship modernisation effort at karabashmed became the construction of a new sulphuric acid plant that allows for the capture of up to 99.9 % of metallurgical gases .
according to vsevolod levin , president of russian copper company , the volume of investments in this project amounted to around 7 billion roubles .
the next stage of modernisation at zao karabashmed is the reconstruction of converter processing .
the replacement of three converters , dust caps , and a flue tract is scheduled for the end of 2017 .
the cost of the project is 2.5 billion roubles .
furthermore , the launch of a new industrial wastewater treatment plant , worth 1 billion roubles , is planned for the end of 2016 .
this , in turn , will increase the amount of taxes paid into the budget of the city of karabash .
over the entire duration of the tominskiy mining and processing plant project , from the start of construction up until the commissioning of the second phase of the project , the federal treasury will receive 8.9 billion roubles .
once the mining and processing plant is in operation , tax revenues for budgets at all levels could amount to 80.9 billion roubles .
over the first year of production in varnensky district , 346.3 million roubles were paid into the budgets of different levels of government .
and this is just for the first year .
‘ the longer the enterprise successfully operates , the more money it can contribute ’ , added valery ulanovsky .
rmk confirmed that , in 2015 , the tax paid by the mikheevsky mining and processing plant was close to 1 billion roubles .
however , the involvement of rmk &apos;s enterprises in the life and development of the areas of their operations is not limited to tax contributions .
rmk &apos;s enterprises are helping to renovate and maintain schools , childcare and sports facilities , build cultural and recreational facilities , and make land improvements .
in 2016 , one of russian copper company &apos;s largest social projects in karabash involved capital repairs to , or , in reality , the almost complete overhaul of childcare facility no. 9 , which serves 95 pupils .
the building , erected in 1960 , was in a sad state of disrepair .
the grounds at rmk arena will also feature a landscaped park with an artificial pond , underground and surface parking for 600 cars , cafes , and sports shops .
rmk arena will make it possible to host exciting , world-class , professional sporting events .
but the main goal of this project is ensure that residents of chelyabinsk , and , first and foremost , the children , have access to engage in physical activity and sports in a comfortable environment .

a pensioner turns a stepladder into a ‘ budget-friendly beach diving platform ’ .
online users laughed at photos of an older man setting up a stepladder on the beach and turning it into a diving board .
the picture was posted on several entertainment portals , as well as in the ‘ my taganrog ’ group on the vkontakte social network , which is why many decided that the photograph was taken on the shore of the azov sea .
in the comments , the ‘ innovation ’ was dubbed a ‘ budget-friendly diving platform ’ and a ‘ mobile diving board ’ .
many praised the man for his creativity and ‘ resourcefulness ’ , while others drew attention to the fact that the man runs a serious risk of injury by jumping from his platform , given that he placed it at an insufficient depth .
however , one of the commentators on the pikabu portal noted that it &apos;s impossible to judge the depth of the sea from the picture .
‘ first of all , we don &apos;t know how deep it is there : the beach could be scattered with sharp drop-offs just a metre in front of the ladder ; and , secondly , even if it &apos;s only one metre deep there , with the right skills , it &apos;s possible to jump from a couple of metres ’ , wrote a user using the nickname , c0jibamdjz
that being said , the italian publication , ‘ roma today ’ , writes that the man with the ladder was spotted on a beach near rome .

the authorities of the french city of cannes have banned visiting local beaches in a burkini : a special bathing suit for women that completely covers the body from the head to the ankles .
abc news reported this on friday , 12 august .
the mayor of cannes , david lisnard , explained that this type of clothing ‘ ignores the rules of decorum , the principles of secularism , and does not adhere to standards of hygiene and safety ’ .

wearing a burkini will result in a fine in the amount of 38 euros ( approximately 42 dollars ) .
it should be noted that the ban is being imposed against the backdrop of terrorist attacks that occurred on 15 july in nice and on 26 july in a church in the city of saint-Étienne-du-rouvray , in the north of the country .

the ministry of interior of thailand has blamed local saboteurs for explosions at resorts .
the explosions at resorts in thailand are ‘ acts of local sabotage ’ and are in no way connected with the activities of international terrorists .
thailand &apos;s police stated this , reuters reports .
according to law enforcement officials , they have still not been able to ascertain whether any of these explosions are connected .
according to the primary theory , their organisers were attempting to disrupt tourist season .
it cannot be ruled out that muslim separatists from the south of the country are behind the explosions .
law enforcement agencies have already detained several people .
at the moment , it is known that there are four dead and several dozen wounded .
the country &apos;s prime minister , prayut chan-ocha , has ordered the implementation of additional security measures to prevent further explosions and rule out additional victims .
a series of explosions occurred at tourist resorts in thailand on friday , 12 august .
the devices were detonated at police stations on the island of phuket , and in the cities of surat thani ( the capital of the province of the same name , within which the island of koh samui is located ) and in hua hin .
another explosive device that was planted on the beach was defused by bomb disposal specialists .
one day earlier , on 11 august , two explosions occurred in the resort town of hua hin .
the bombs were inside of plant pots and were activated by a call from a mobile phone .
10 foreign tourists are among the victims ; there are no russian citizens among them .

the owners of messenger apps and email services must identify users and remove prohibited information : such is the summary of a bill developed by the media-communications union ( mks ) , which unites russia &apos;s largest communications service providers ( vedomosti has a copy ) .
employees from three companies that are members of the union have confirmed that such a proposal is being discussed .
it should be presented to a working group headed by first deputy prime minister , igor shuvalov , in early autumn , says vedomosti &apos;s source in the mks .
the issue concerns amendments to laws on communications and mass media .
they stipulate that any ‘ organiser of information disseminated on the internet , which enables the exchange of electronic messages ’ , is obliged to identify users based on information contained in the service provider &apos;s databases , having previously entered into agreements with them .
as well as ‘ immediately block messages or publications that contain information that is distributed in violation of the requirements of russian legislation ’ .
alternatively , operators may restrict access to the service based on a decision by roskomnadzor .

astronomers have discovered a mysterious space object beyond neptune .
the celestial body is very dim and its diameter is about 200 kilometres , the publication , ‘ new scientist ’ , writes .
according to researchers , the object is moving in an orbit that is completely uncharacteristic of the solar system .
it is situated almost perpendicular in respect to the other planets .
the mysterious discovery was dubbed , niku , which , if translated from chinese , means ‘ rebel ’ or ‘ unconquered ’ .
wsj : the united states is considering imposing sanctions against the russian federation over the hacking of the democrats &apos; servers .
us officials are considering imposing new sanctions against russia in response to the hacking of the democratic party &apos;s servers , writes the wall street journal , citing sources .
according to reports , in order to impose sanctions , the administration of president barack obama will need to officially accuse russia of attacking the servers or hackers supported by the russian authorities .
according to sources , the fbi and other american intelligence agencies are almost certain of russia &apos;s involvement in the cyberattack .
the wsj notes that , generally , the united states prefers not to specifically name those who carry out cyberattacks .
an exception was the hacking of sony pictures entertainment ’ s database in 2014 , the responsibility for which was officially placed on the dprk .
last year , however , obama issued a decree simplifying the procedure for imposing sanctions against those who engage in or facilitate cyberattacks .
it was originally aimed against china , but it can also be used against other countries .
the sanctions decision-making process could be lengthy , the newspaper writes .
even if officials come to the conclusion that the hackers were supported by russia , they will need to weigh the possible consequences before a decision on the disclosure of such information is made .
they will need to determine if the incident is serious enough for them to exacerbate tensions in bilateral relations .
earlier , it was reported that the obama administration is considering the possibility of applying sanctions against the state whose hackers broke into the servers of the national committee of the democratic party .
the website , wikileaks , published the email correspondence of the democratic national committee .
the media reported that hackers working with the russian authorities might be involved in the hack .
the kremlin has called such reports absurd .
the fas has fined google almost half a billion roubles
the reason was a violation of competition in the mobile applications market .
the antitrust proceedings were initiated by yandex .
the russian company argued that google grants manufacturers of smartphones access to android components on terms that prohibited the pre-installation of applications from other developers , and , in particular , yandex .
the fas has confirmed these claims and found that the company abused its dominant position in the market and forced manufacturers of mobile devices to install other apps alongside the google play store .
following the results of the inquiry , the federal antimonopoly service decided to penalise google , said alexey dotsenko , deputy head of the fas .
the fine must be paid within 60 days of the ruling entering into force .
the fas concluded that all companies , including multinationals , must comply with the law on the protection of competition .
by the same token , google intends to first examine the ruling and then determine the next steps to be taken : abide by it or challenge it .
the federal antimonopoly service declared the company to be in violation of the competition law back in september of last year and ordered them to adjust their contracts by 18 december .
however , google refused to agree to this .
since then , the company and the agency have been involved in litigation .
the fas has noted that , in spite of the fine , they are discussing the possibility of concluding a settlement agreement with google .
the current course of action is leading nowhere .
this is the view expressed to echo of moscow by eldar murtazin , a leading analyst with mobile research group .
murtazin also noted that the fine would have no impact on either users or on the competitiveness of the corporation .
a volga region resident leased a flat and then plundered it to the tune of 84 thousand roubles .
the 30-year-old thief managed to sell the stolen household appliances .
the press service of the regional main directorate of the ministry of the interior of russia told a correspondent from mk in volgograd that , yesterday evening , a resident of a satellite town contacted the police department with a statement about the robbery .
the man told the guardians of the law that an unknown man was leasing a flat from him .
when the owner went to check on his dwelling , he found it completely empty : no washing machine , no television , no fridge , not even the tenant .
the total damages amounted to 84 thousand roubles .
soon thereafter , the guardians of order were hot on the thief ’ s trail .
it turned out to be a 30-year-old unemployed volga region resident .
the man was arrested and he confessed , stating that he had already managed to sell the stolen property .
now he will have to answer for the theft to the fullest extent of the law : a criminal case has been opened in relation to the man in custody .
this year , residents of crimea will receive a notice to pay transport taxes .
now , residents of the peninsula will pay taxes on land , property , and transport .
the head of the federal tax service for the republic of crimea , roman nazdrachev , spoke about this at a press conference .
by the end of 2016 , crimean automobile owners will receive a notice to pay transport tax .
so far , the tax agency has counted around 250,000 people owning vehicles .
the state traffic safety inspectorate and the federal registration service will provide information on taxpayers .
‘ if , as of the first of january , we receive data on owners of real estate and land , then the citizens of crimea will be responsible for paying these taxes next year ’ , stated roman nazdrachev .
citizens entitled to benefits will be granted discounts on the payment of property taxes ; first and foremost this concerns the category of pensioners .
also , there is a system of deductions on land tax , depending on the entitlement category of the taxpayer , but according to the head of the federal tax service , it &apos;s too early to talk about this before 2017 .

osce observers have not recorded military activity on the crimean border .
observers from the organisation for security and cooperation in europe ( osce ) have not recorded military activity on the russian-ukrainian border .
this is indicated in a statement published on the organisation &apos;s website .
the observers report that the situation on the crimean border is calm , and that no incidents that could be related to the security of ukraine and russia have been recorded .
‘ not one of the observers could confirm media reports that concern safety issues , including gunfire and military activities in close proximity to the administrative border ’ , the osce report states .
the organisation &apos;s staff continues to monitor the situation at three checkpoints on the border near the ukrainian cities of kalanchak and chaplinka and the chonhar peninsula in the gulf of sivash .
earlier , the state border service of ukraine reported that russian troops were completing a rotation on the crimean border .
moreover , the agency claims that the new contingent has more modern equipment .

snapchat &quot; anime &quot; effect is criticized as asian caricature
snapchat says this filter is inspired by anime , but some observers say it &apos;s racially insensitive .
with its lens tool , snapchat allows some 150 million daily users to alter reality and play with identity in ways that border on the absurd .
you can turn yourself into a pineapple , a dog or a character befitting a roy lichtenstein painting .
the lenses are blunt , feature-warping tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day .
any missteps quickly enter the public record .
snapchat lenses have drawn criticism in the past with accusations that the app was promoting blackface or encouraging whitened skin tones as an ideal of beauty .
so when it pushed a lens to some users this week that gave them slanted eyes , distorted teeth and puffy cheeks , some critics called it a racist caricature of asian people - &quot; yellowface . &quot;
and they wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity .
the news and the outrage went wide on wednesday , with reports by the verge and motherboard , a day after snapchat said it had dismantled the feature .
the company offered an explanation : the lens was meant as homage to anime characters , not as a caricature of asian people .
but for observers who have experienced racism , the lens reminded them of hurtful stereotypes in action .
others roundly rejected the anime comparison .
in an email , grace sparapani , a korean american art student whose tweet about the photos was widely shared , said that the lens was &quot; hurtful and uncomfortable to say the least . &quot;
she added that &quot; it &apos;s hard to argue with the side by side comparison of the very gross asian caricature and the filter &apos;s effects .
it shows that the filter isn &apos;t just yellowface , but yellowface taken to its derogatory extreme .
snapchat is not the only company to cross these cultural tripwires .
american culture seems involved in an endless struggle over diversity and inclusion , from corporate boardrooms to hollywood and the devices we all carry in our hands .
and snapchat &apos;s huge audience of younger people - who are more racially diverse than their older counterparts - might mean that they are even more likely to expect sensitivity .
when one of snapchat &apos;s lenses creates an image that is insulting to a user , 25-year-old katie zhu said in an interview on thursday , &quot; it &apos;s much harder for these types of things to go unnoticed like they did before . &quot;
on thursday , ms. zhu , a product manager and engineer who works for medium , decided to delete her snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same .
in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said she believed that the race-related controversies reflected a lack of diversity in hiring practices at snapchat .
ms. zhu criticized the company &apos;s mostly white , all-male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag : # deletesnapchat .
&quot; it &apos;s either that they had no diverse representation of people of color on their staff to the point where they &apos;re able to make decisions like this , &quot; ms. zhu , who is chinese-american , said , &quot; or they do have some people of color who are working there , but they &apos;re not on positions where they feel safe or comfortable to speak up . &quot;
other observers share her view , a complaint that snapchat has left largely unanswered .
the company does not release figures about diversity on its staff , noting its status as a private company .
on thursday , snapchat declined to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff , but according to a spokesman , the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and on driving inclusion efforts internally .
for her part , ms. zhu said she would keep her snapchat account closed , adding , &quot; i wonder if they actually need more users like us to be able to say that this is not o.k. &quot;
military officials distorted isis intelligence , congressional panel says
officials from the united states central command altered intelligence reports to portray a more optimistic picture of the war against the islamic state in iraq and syria than events on the ground warranted , a congressional panel said in a report issued thursday .
the interim report , from a task force established by the republican chairmen of the house armed services committee , intelligence committee and defense appropriations subcommittee , found &quot; widespread dissatisfaction &quot; among central command intelligence analysts , who said superiors were doctoring their assessments of american efforts to defeat the islamic state .
central command , known as centcom , is the military headquarters in tampa , fla . , that oversees american military operations across the middle east and central asia .
&quot; intelligence products approved by senior centcom leaders typically provided a more positive depiction of u.s. antiterrorism efforts than was warranted by facts on the ground and were consistently more positive than analysis produced by other elements of the intelligence community , &quot; a news release about the report said .
&quot; what happened at centcom is unacceptable - our war fighters suffer when bad analysis is presented to senior policy makers , &quot; said representative ken calvert , republican of california .
the leadership failures at centcom reach to the very top of the organization .
the 10-page report detailed persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in central command &apos;s description and analysis of american efforts to train iraqi forces .
although it offers no definitive evidence that senior obama administration officials ordered the reports to be doctored , it describes analysts as feeling as though they were under pressure from centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the islamic state , also known as isis or isil .
&quot; throughout the first half of 2015 , many central command press releases , statements and congressional testimonies were significantly more positive than actual events , &quot; the report said .
for example , a centcom official stated publicly that a major military assault to take back mosul could begin as early as april or may 2015 .
mosul , iraq &apos;s second-largest city , remains under the control of the islamic state .
&quot; after months of investigation , this much is very clear , &quot; representative mike pompeo , republican of kansas , said in a statement .
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the united states central command &apos;s most senior intelligence leaders manipulated the command &apos;s intelligence products to downplay the threat from isis in iraq .
republicans created the task force after learning that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence about the islamic state was being manipulated .
the report released thursday is to be followed up by more extensive findings as the investigation continues .
there is an additional , ongoing investigation of centcom intelligence by the department of defense inspector general .
democratic members of the house intelligence committee released their own findings on thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the republican task force .
&quot; between 2014 and 2015 , centcom created an overly insular process for producing intelligence assessments on isil and iraqi security forces , &quot; representative adam b. schiff , the committee &apos;s top democrat , said in a statement .
this process , mr. schiff said , &quot; stalled the release of intelligence products , &quot; hurt morale among analysts and &quot; insufficiently accommodated dissenting views . &quot;
but mr. schiff and the democrats said they found no evidence that the white house tried to pressure centcom analysts to fit their conclusions to a &quot; preset or political narrative . &quot;
the preliminary results of the congressional investigation were reported tuesday by the daily beast .
last august , the new york times reported the existence of the pentagon inspector general investigation , opened after complaints by centcom analysts .
lt. cmdr. patrick evans , a pentagon spokesman , said in a statement that the defense department would not comment on the congressional report while the inspector general &apos;s investigation continued .
but he said that &quot; experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data , and the intelligence community and department of defense welcome healthy dialogue on these vital national security topics . &quot;
the investigation has repercussions beyond the question of whether the american-led bombing campaign in iraq and syria is succeeding ( an assertion now made by a growing number of defense officials ) .
but last year &apos;s allegations called into question how much president obama could rely on central command for honest assessments of military operations in iraq , afghanistan , libya and other crisis spots .
the critiques on the islamic state intelligence mirror disputes of more than a decade ago , when a centcom intelligence analyst , gregory hooker , wrote a research paper saying that the administration of president george w. bush , over many analysts &quot; objections , advocated a small force in iraq and spent little time thinking about what would follow the 2003 invasion .
mr. hooker also played a key part in the insurrection over the islamic state intelligence .
last year , officials said , mr. hooker &apos;s team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary , airstrikes against islamic state-held refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group &apos;s finances because it had built makeshift refineries to sell oil on the black market .
but the finding was not distributed outside central command , the times reported in september .
centcom &apos;s commander then , gen. lloyd j. austin iii , came under criticism last year after senate testimony viewed by many lawmakers as being an overly positive assessment of the war .
general austin retired in april and was replaced at central command by gen. joseph l. votel .
u.s. wins 4th straight in women &apos;s field hockey , setting up showdown with britain
one day after scoring three goals in a 6-1 victory over japan , katie bam scored the first two goals for the united states women &apos;s field hockey team on thursday as the americans defeated india , 3-0 .
five goals in two games should be a memorable feat , but bam , 27 , said she was not sure if she had ever done the same thing .
&quot; i have no clue , &quot; she said .
i &apos;m not really one of those people who keeps track of their goals .
here is what she does know : the americans are 4-0 in the olympic tournament and are tied for first place in their group with britain , which remained unbeaten after defeating japan , 2-0 , on thursday .
britain and the united states will meet on saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have qualified for the quarter finals , and the game will decide who finishes first in their six-team bracket and who finishes second .
the first-place finisher will avoid the powerful dutch , the leaders of the other bracket , for a bit longer when the quarter finals begin .
however saturday &apos;s game turns out , the americans have created a stir with their surprising run here , four years after finishing last among 12 teams at the london games .
bam was on that team .
she grew up in blue bell , pa . , first picked up a field hockey stick when she was 3 ( her twin older sisters played the sport at drexel ) and joined the national team when she was 16 , becoming its youngest player ever .
she missed out on the 2008 olympics when she did not make the cut for the final roster .
then came 2012 , when nothing much went right for her and her teammates .
the next year , craig parnham , an englishman , was named the coach , and things began to change .
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change , a physical change , &quot; bam said .
we didn &apos;t have the work rate in london that we have now .
we &apos;ve made a complete turnaround .
on thursday night , bam opened the scoring in the first half with a backhand shot from close in .
india had come into the game without a victory in the tournament , but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until late in the third period , when bam took charge .
she made a long run with the ball down the left side of the field , then curled into the middle and whipped the ball into the goal to give the americans a 2-0 lead .
melissa gonzalez added the final goal midway through the fourth period .
the shutout was the first of the tournament for the united states goalie , jackie briggs , who had allowed one goal in each of the first three victories .
she is on a roll .
so is bam .
&quot; we &apos;re in a good place right now , &quot; parnham said , but just how good it is will depend on the result of saturday &apos;s game .
amid the fury of the olympics , the zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , whatever time it is , it is the olympics .
the events in rio de janeiro feel constant and inescapable , a furious relay of competition and striving .
it is as if the olympic torch itself were a flaming baton , passed from archer to swimmer to gymnast to triathlete .
you can &apos;t turn on a television , read a newspaper or listen in on your neighbor &apos;s conversation in a coffee-shop line without hearing about simone biles , katie ledecky or the feud between michael phelps and chad le clos .
and then there is logan dooley .
mr. dooley , a first-time olympian and a dimpled heartthrob in the making , may well be among those household names being showcased in prime time , buoyed by sponsorships and feel-good tv commercials , if he were a swimmer , a gymnast or even a fencer .
but mr. dooley , 28 , of lake forest , calif . , is competing for the gold in olympic trampoline .
the olympic flame does not illuminate each event equally .
further from the center , partly in shadow , are those sports not universally acknowledged : air-pistol shooting , archery , badminton , taekwondo .
we will always have the breaststroke , and long may it reign .
but if i may make a modest case for my particular favorite , let me call attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
though trampoline has been an olympic event since 2000 , when it debuted at the sydney games , it has spent the intervening 16 years so barely acknowledged that many i surveyed did not realize it was an olympic sport at all .
this may be a regional ignorance .
despite sending athletes to compete , the united states has never won a medal in trampoline and did not have an athlete advance to the finals until 2012 .
the chinese and the russians tend to split the prizes for the men , and the chinese and the canadians for the women .
dong dong of china and rosie maclennan of canada will be defending their london gold medals this year .
but there is an underdog charm to trampoline , in part because it sounds , to the unenlightened ear , fitter for clown college than the olympics .
here i should confess that i am no expert , just an earthbound enthusiast .
it does have comic potential - the cartoon quaver of its never-ending bounce - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving , the two sports it essentially combines .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; derives from the spanish el trampolín , meaning &quot; diving board . &quot;
aspiring champions jump on a giant trampoline , shooting up to nearly 30 feet in the air , and are called upon to perform a series of tumbling moves ( twists , pikes and somersaults ) before eventually landing on their feet .
they are judged on execution , difficulty and &quot; flight time , &quot; according to the official olympic program .
thirty-two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in rio .
the most common olympic vector is straight ahead .
medal hopefuls must go farther , faster , up and over , in their quest for gold , sometimes to the finish , other times back and forth up and down the court .
they are chasing not only the finish line or the starting wall but also , in the televised coverage , another taunting line : that of the world , or olympic , record .
this single-minded pursuit is noble , admirable , even fanatic - and it is enough to bring even a spectator to tears .
but it is also what i find slightly exhausting about even watching the games .
from this , trampoline offers a respite .
the trampoliner &apos;s vector is up .
forward motion is not the goal .
he or she rebounds , seeming weightless as an astronaut , going up , then down , then effortlessly up again .
it is not without competition , of course , nor without difficulty , but for the duration of a routine , there is no frantic charge toward the end , no vaulting into the distance , just the dreamy , graceful suspension of time and gravity .
it is as close to zen as olympic competition gets .
the women &apos;s qualifiers and then finals will take place on friday afternoon , streaming at 1 p.m. eastern time ; the men &apos;s on saturday , also at 1 .
nbc will air the finals as part of an afternoon block beginning at 2 p.m. on both days .
in the midst of olympic mania , they promise a quiet , lovely moment , one likely to be overlooked in the general melee .
and if consciousness raising is to be achieved only by offering up male athletes for ogling and objectification - as the united states men &apos;s gymnasts recently proposed , according to the wall street journal - mr. dooley only awaits his gasping new fan base .
&quot; a generation is protesting &quot; in ethiopia , long a u.s. ally
violent protests in ethiopia
demonstrators demanding political change in ethiopia have been met with violent resistance by the government .
witnesses say that scores of protesters have been fatally shot during clashes with police .
is ethiopia about to crack ?
for the last decade , it has been one africa &apos;s most stable nations , a solid western ally with a fast-growing economy .
but in recent months , anti-government protests have convulsed the country , spreading into more and more areas .
in the last week alone , thousands of people stormed into the streets , demanding fundamental political change .
the government response , according to human rights groups , was ruthless .
witnesses said that police officers shot and killed scores of unarmed demonstrators .
videos circulating from protests thought to be from late last year or earlier this year show security officers whipping young people with sticks as they were forced to perform handstands against a wall .
the top united nations human rights official is now calling for a thorough investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult holding this country together , and moving forward , it will be even harder , &quot; said rashid abdi , the horn of africa project director for the international crisis group , a research group .
ethiopia is the second most populous nation in africa , after nigeria , and its stability is cherished by the west .
american military and intelligence services work closely with the ethiopians to combat terrorist threats across the region , especially in somalia , and few if any countries in africa receive as much western aid .
ethiopia &apos;s economy has been expanding at an impressive clip .
its infrastructure has improved drastically - there is even a new commuter train in the capital , addis ababa .
and its streets are typically quiet , safe and clean .
though ethiopia has hardly been a paragon of democracy - human rights groups have constantly cited the government &apos;s repressiveness - opposition within the country had been limited , with dissidents effectively silenced .
many have been exiled , jailed , killed or driven to the far reaches of the desert .
but that may be changing .
&quot; if you suffocate people and they don &apos;t have any other options but to protest , it breaks out , &quot; said seyoum teshome , a university lecturer in central ethiopia .
the whole youth is protesting .
a generation is protesting .
the complaints are many , covering everything from land use to the governing coalition &apos;s stranglehold on power .
after a widely criticized election last year , the governing party and its allies got the last seat the opposition had held and now control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time , tensions are rising along the border with eritrea ; a battle along that jagged , disputed line claimed hundreds of lives in june .
analysts fear that separatist groups that had been more or less vanquished in recent years , like the oromo liberation front or the ogaden national liberation front , may try to exploit the turbulence and rearm .
several factors explain why bitter feelings , after years of simmering beneath the surface , are exploding now .
the first is seemingly innocuous : smartphones .
only in the last couple of years have large numbers of ethiopians been able to communicate using social media as cheaper smartphones became common and internet service improved .
even when the government shuts down access to facebook and twitter , as it frequently does , especially during protests , many people are still able to communicate via internet proxies that mask where they are .
several young ethiopians said this was how they gathered for protests .
second , there is more solidarity between oromos and amharas , ethiopia &apos;s two largest ethnic groups .
oromos and amharas are not natural allies .
for eons , amharas from ethiopia &apos;s predominantly christian highlands flourished in politics and business , exploiting the oromos , many of whom are muslim and live in lowland areas .
but that is changing as well .
&quot; we are on the way to coordinate under one umbrella , &quot; said mulatu gemechu , an oromo leader .
the biggest protests have been in amhara and oromo areas .
many amharas and oromos feel ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the tigrayan ethnic group , which makes up about 6 percent of the population and dominates the military , the intelligence services , commerce and politics .
the third reason behind the unrest is the loss of meles zenawi .
mr. meles , a former rebel leader , was ethiopia &apos;s prime minister for 17 years , until his death from an undisclosed illness in 2012 .
he was considered a tactical genius , a man who could see around corners .
analysts say he was especially adept at detecting early signals of discontent and using emissaries to massage and defang opponents .
&quot; the current regime lacks that ground savvy , &quot; mr. abdi , the conflict analyst , said .
ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , hailemariam desalegn , was plucked from relative obscurity to fill mr. meles &apos;s shoes .
unlike mr. meles , who came from the tigray region of northern ethiopia , mr. hailemariam is a southerner .
analysts say he does not have the trust of the tigrayan-controlled security services .
the result , many fear , is more bloodshed .
the last time ethiopia experienced such turmoil was in 2005 , after thousands protested over what analysts have said appeared to be an election the government bungled and then stole .
in the ensuing crackdown , many protesters were killed , though fewer than in recent months , and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly .
development experts have praised ethiopia &apos;s leaders for visionary infrastructure planning , such as the new commuter train , and measurable strides in fighting poverty .
but clearly that has not stopped the internal resentment of ethiopia &apos;s government from intensifying .
and it is taking a dangerous ethnic shape .
last month , protesters in gondar , an amhara town , attacked businesses owned by tigrayans , and anti-tigrayan hatred is becoming more common in social media .
analysts say the protests are putting the united states and other western allies in an awkward position .
the american government has used ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring somalia , though it recently said it closed that base .
while the west clearly wants to support democracy , it also does not want its ally in an already volatile region to crumble .
&quot; that , &quot; mr. abdi said , &quot; is a very tight rope to walk . &quot;
donald trump explains his obama-founded-isis claim as &quot; sarcasm &quot;
donald j. trump tried to quash the latest controversy engulfing his campaign on friday by claiming that he was not serious when he insisted several times this week that president obama and hillary clinton were the &quot; founders &quot; of the islamic state terrorist group .
the clarification raised new questions about the republican presidential nominee &apos;s ability to communicate clearly to the american public .
it also put his surrogates , who have strained to defend him during a tumultuous stretch , in the awkward position of having to explain remarks that he might not mean .
after making the suggestion at a rally on wednesday night , mr. trump doubled down on the assertion on thursday , insisting in interviews that he really did intend to say that the president and mrs. clinton had created isis .
but in an early-morning twitter post on friday , mr. trump said that he was just being sarcastic .
the post was a reversal from just a day ago , when mr. trump said in a number of interviews that he was indeed serious about the charge .
when the conservative radio host hugh hewitt tried to help mr. trump soften the remark by reminding him that mr. obama wants to destroy isis , the republican presidential nominee would not have it .
the latest firestorm comes as mr. trump has been trying to refocus his campaign on the economy amid declining poll numbers .
mr. trump and mrs. clinton gave dueling economic speeches in michigan this week .
on friday , mr. trump tried again to return to that subject .
taking again to twitter , he warned that mrs. clinton &apos;s proposals would come with higher taxes and he said that he found her speech boring .
mr. trump has used the sarcasm defense before .
in late july , after he drew widespread criticism by appearing to suggest that the russians should hack mrs. clinton &apos;s emails , he later explained his remarks by saying , &quot; of course i &apos;m being sarcastic . &quot;
the approach allows mr. trump to push the limits of political speech and dial it back as needed .
&quot; i think it &apos;s a pattern of him testing certain messages that resonate with his fans , seeing how they play , and then &quot; clarifying &quot; one way or another depending on the reaction , &quot; said ruth sherman , a communications expert who has been monitoring the language used by both candidates .
but i also think he &apos;s clever about his statements and knows they are vague enough to be filtered through various lenses .
instead of toning things down for a general election audience , mr. trump has taken an even more caustic tone in recent days as his poll numbers have continued to tumble .
a new nbc / wall street journal / marist poll released on friday showed mr. trump trailing mrs. clinton by large margins in north carolina , virginia and colorado and locked in a tight race in florida .
while mr. trump generally tries to avoid apologizing for provocative things that he says , he often accuses his critics of misconstruing his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor .
but as he faces heightened scrutiny during the final months of the presidential campaign , mr. trump &apos;s jokes have put his loyal allies in the uncomfortable position of having to publicly stand up for him no matter how provocative his remarks .
rudolph w. giuliani , the former new york city mayor who is one of mr. trump &apos;s most prominent surrogates , went to great lengths to defend the candidate in an interview with cnn on thursday .
&quot; i think what he &apos;s saying there is legitimate , political commentary , &quot; mr. giuliani said when questioned about the veracity of mr. trump &apos;s assertion about mr. obama and mrs. clinton having founded the islamic state .
it is true in a sense that before obama , isis was an almost unknown , small little organization , he who called it the jayvee , totally wrong , and here &apos;s why it happened , because he withdrew the troops from iraq .
most mainstream republicans try to argue that the obama administration , in which mrs. clinton served as secretary of state , allowed isis to fester by failing to aggressively manage the situation in the middle east .
ahead of rallies in pennsylvania on friday , mr. trump continued to lash out on twitter at the news media for harping on his every word and for being biased against him .
he mocked the &quot; poor , pathetic &quot; television pundits who try to figure him out and said , &quot; they can &apos;t ! &quot;
some democrats scoffed at mr. trump &apos;s excuse as more evidence that he is unfit to be president .
once priced out , a cafe returns in greenpoint
verb cafe was a shabby , cash-only space in williamsburg that had no wi-fi but served good coffee for 15 years .
naturally , it got priced out of its bedford avenue storefront .
the store that replaced the verb in the summer of 2014 , soap cherie , sells soaps in the shape of cupcakes .
locals bemoaned it as the latest loss in a gentrifying city .
the artist molly crabapple wrote on twitter , &quot; new york is change , i know , but still , can &apos;t believe cbgb &apos;s is dead and the chelsea hotel is gutted and verb is now a soap shop . &quot;
but if new york is change , it is also reinvention .
a revived verb cafe opened last november in greenpoint , less than a mile north of the original location .
the new verb has wi-fi and accepts credit cards but has some of the same employees and a similar unpretentious vibe .
the coffee is still good , too .
leading the new verb is cisco rodriguez , a longtime employee at the old cafe who is an owner and the general manager at the new place .
he started at verb in 2001 and was there until the end .
when a customer offered to bankroll him in a new outpost , he said he was excited to do it .
mr. rodriguez , 36 , kept a lot of things the same .
verb uses the same distributor for the bagels and bought the same model of espresso machine .
it even reused the lights from the old verb .
but mr. rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
bacon-egg-and-cheese sandwiches are on the menu , and toppings like capers and sautéed onions are available .
there are brown-rice bowls .
the cafe no longer serves beer but now makes fresh juices .
nine months in , mr. rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regulars .
&quot; a lot of former customers got priced out of williamsburg too , &quot; he said .
on a recent sunday , rebecca oliveira was one such customer .
ms. oliveira , 34 , used to live in williamsburg and went to verb frequently .
even after she moved to greenpoint , she would still make the trek .
after verb closed , she said , she gave up drinking coffee for a while .
&quot; i realized it was the coffee and the culture at verb that i liked , &quot; she said .
now she &apos;s back on coffee , although that day , instead of her usual iced coffee , she went with a blended chai drink , another new addition .
tom rosenthal , another longtime customer , went faithfully to verb starting in 2003 .
he &apos;d go before work and order the same thing without fail .
&quot; quarter past seven , every day , like clockwork , i &apos;d come in and they were making my everything bagel with butter , &quot; he said .
photo mr. rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and introduced new ingredients to the menu .
these days , mr. rosenthal still gets his regular order , but sometimes he &apos;ll switch things up with the bacon , egg and cheese on an everything bagel .
mr. rodriguez said he had no hard feelings about the soap shop taking over the old space .
in fact , the soap cherie owners offered to make special soap for verb , using the cafe &apos;s cold-brewed coffee as an ingredient .
&quot; i think we still might take them up on it , &quot; mr. rodriguez said .
and greenpoint &apos;s traditional polish residents have embraced the cafe as well .
one of these new customers translated the menu into polish , and mr. rodriguez said he planned to find a spot to display it soon to make his new neighbors feel welcome .
the new location has other perks .
a local juice spot wants to bottle and sell the cold-brewed coffee .
there is a chance the cafe will expand into an adjacent building .
for many customers , a new verb to get their old favorites is enough .
joseph whitt was a regular and said he was heartbroken when they closed .
when the new space opened , mr. whitt said , walking in and getting a coffee felt like a homecoming .
&quot; i &apos;ve needed to smell that , &quot; he said .
the depressing food of the depression , in &quot; a square meal &quot;
in march 1933 , shortly after ascending to the presidency , franklin delano roosevelt sat down to lunch in the oval office .
a gourmand , president roosevelt had a taste for fancy fifth avenue foods like pâté de foie gras and maryland terrapin soup .
his menu that day was more humble : deviled eggs in tomato sauce , mashed potatoes and , for dessert , prune pudding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who were suffering , &quot; jane ziegelman said .
her husband , andrew coe , added , &quot; it was also a message to americans about how to eat . &quot;
the couple , who live in brooklyn heights , are food historians .
mr. coe &apos;s last book , &quot; chop suey , &quot; was about chinese cuisine in america , while ms. ziegelman told the story of life in a lower east side tenement through food in her book &quot; 97 orchard . &quot;
their new , collaborative work , &quot; a square meal , &quot; which will be published tuesday by harper , is a history of american food in the great depression .
showing some culinary solidarity of their own , they met a reporter for dinner at eisenberg &apos;s sandwich shop , a tiny no-frills lunch counter in the flatiron district that has been in business since the year of the crash , 1929 .
ms. ziegelman , 54 , ordered a cream cheese and chopped olive sandwich , while mr. coe , 57 , had the turkey , mashed potatoes and vegetable medley .
when a reporter ordered meatloaf , the couple deemed it fitting for a discussion of depression-era eating .
&quot; loaves were very popular , &quot; ms. ziegelman said .
there was peanut loaf , liver loaf , bean loaf .
they were made from an ingredient and a cheap thing that stretches the ingredient out .
imagine eating enough peanuts to serve as your dinner .
mr. coe grimaced .
&quot; it must have sat in your stomach like lead , &quot; he said .
in the years before the depression , the american table , especially in rural areas , was an all-you-can-eat buffet .
teams of women cooked for male farmworkers , and fresh-baked pie was served at breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was americans who had sent food to starving europeans during world war i. &quot; a square meal &quot; chronicles the ways the nation coped with suddenly not being the land of plenty .
&quot; this was a time when food became a central , fraught subject for the american people , &quot; mr. coe said , explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it .
equally fraught was the new budget diet : mystery dishes like loaves and casseroles became staples , the casserole a &quot; wonderful way to repurpose leftovers , &quot; ms. ziegelman noted , because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy coating of sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit .
meat , for years the center of the american meal , became a sparingly apportioned luxury .
strange mashups were tried as caloric and nutritional fulfillment took precedent over taste or even common kitchen sense .
in researching the book , which includes recipes , ms. ziegelman prepared a period dish of baked onion stuffed with peanut butter .
&quot; it was not a popular addition to the dinner table , &quot; mr. coe said .
ms. ziegelman amplified : &quot; it was surreal . &quot;
peanut butter has nothing to say to a baked onion .
it was characteristic of a lot of the home-ec recipes .
as never before or since , home economists - among them louise stanley , chief of the federal bureau of home economics from 1923 to 1943 - drove the country &apos;s eating habits .
publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; budgeteers &quot; and rise to the challenge of transforming glop like creamed spaghetti with carrots into tasty dishes .
&quot; a square meal &quot; is a feast of historical tidbits .
especially savory are the accounts of the government &apos;s response to its hungry citizenry , like president herbert hoover &apos;s let-me-eat-cake attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple iowa farmhouse cooking of his childhood , he dined like the millionaire sophisticate he had become .
&quot; he liked to eat continental cuisine , like fish with cucumber sauce , &quot; mr. coe said .
he ate in almost a gold-plated dining room , wearing a dinner jacket .
he was fabulously out of touch .
president roosevelt may have committed the same error if his wife , eleanor , had not encouraged him to set an example with his stomach .
as the book tells it , mrs. roosevelt &apos;s hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in flavor resulted in a white house that &quot; put out not only some of the dreariest food in washington but also some of the most dismally prepared . &quot;
many of the depression-era food ways were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet .
the legacy is in our continued focus on calories and nutrition , ms. ziegelman said , and on the way science has been applied to cooking .
the couple said that in writing the book , they gained greater understanding of the eating habits of ms. ziegelman &apos;s mother - how she couldn &apos;t throw food away , for instance .
&quot; she had a real fear of food waste , &quot; mr. coe said .
ms. ziegelman recalled : &quot; she actually got people sick . &quot;
there was the cream-puff incident .
after the plates were cleared at eisenberg &apos;s , she and mr. coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home : the prune dessert that president roosevelt ate for lunch .
&quot; it &apos;s called prune whip , &quot; ms. ziegelman said , adding that a common trick was to give modest recipes a snazzy name .
there was no whipped cream , just prunes , a little bit of flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone reluctantly dipped a spoon into the viscous brown goo .
surprisingly , it wasn &apos;t bad .
mr. coe went back for seconds , and thirds .
sounding like a can-do budgeter , he told his wife , &quot; some chopped walnuts would help . &quot;
the detention of defendants in the case of a mass brawl at khovanskoye cemetery has been extended to 14 november
presnensky court is keeping defendants in the case of a mass brawl at khovanskoye cemetery in detention until 14 november , having granted a corresponding request from investigators .
there are 14 defendants in this case .
recall that , on 14 may , there was a mass brawl at khovanskoye cemetery between hundreds of immigrants from central asia and the north caucasus , which involved the use of weapons and resulted in the deaths of three people .
the former head of the cemetery , yury chabuev , and a lawyer and co-founder of the public organisation , healthy nation , alexander bocharnikov , have been charged with organising murder .
the matter of the second indexation of pensions in 2016 , could be decided in the next two to three weeks .
this was announced on 12 august , by deputy prime minister , olga golodets , during a visit to bryansk region .
we have put in place specific parameters as to how much pensions should be increased in order to cancel-out the inflation that exists in the country .
all the calculations have been made .
right now , economists are taking stock of the past six months and we will complete this work within the next two to three weeks ’ , interfax quotes golodets as saying .
commenting on the plan to increase the retirement age by six months each year , proposed by the head of the centre for strategic research , alexei kudrin , the deputy prime minister announced that the cabinet is not considering this subject .
at the end of july , news broke that the government had agreed on a policy to fully index pension benefits in 2017 .
kamensky and grigoryan made it into the final of the smallbore rifle shooting competition .
russian athletes , sergei kamensky and kirill grigoryan , made it into the final of the smallbore rifle prone shooting competition at the olympic games in brazil .
tass reports that sergei kamensky earned 629 points and took first place : this is a new olympic record for the qualifying round .
kirill grigoryan was second with 628.9 points .
only the top eight athletes made it into the final .
kamensky is the world record holder in this discipline ( 633 ) .
turkish oppositionist , fethullah gülen , calls for an international investigation into the circumstances surrounding the coup attempt in turkey .
‘ i demand that an independent international commission investigate the coup attempt ’ , the french newspaper , le monde , quotes gülen as saying .
the turkish oppositionist also said that , ‘ if any part of the charges are confirmed , i will return to turkey ’ .
gülen , however , wholeheartedly denies involvement in the coup , stressing that his organisation has never aspired to political power .
earlier , the istanbul court issued an in absentia arrest warrant for the oppositionist islamic preacher , fethullah gülen .
recall that a military coup attempt took place in turkey on the night of the 15-16 of july .
gilead to get attorney fees in hepatitis c patent fight with merck
gilead sciences inc is entitled to receive the attorney fees it incurred related to hepatitis c patent litigation with drugmaker merck &amp; co inc , a u.s. district judge has ruled .
in june , gilead was freed from paying up $ 200 million in damages for infringing two merck patents related to gilead &apos;s blockbuster drugs sovaldi and harvoni , after a u.s. judge found a pattern of misconduct by merck including lying under oath and other unethical practices .
in a filing on thursday , u.s. district judge beth labson freeman said that gilead was entitled to relief from the fees it incurred while defending the case .
merck is trying to catch up to gilead , which dominates the market on a new generation of hepatitis c drugs that can cure well over 90 percent of patients with the liver disease .
the case dates back to 2013 when gilead and merck sued each other , claiming ownership of laboratory work underlying sofosbuvir , the active ingredient in gilead &apos;s drugs .
u.s. backed forces say they have seized full control of manbij from islamic state
u.s.-backed forces have seized full control of northern city of manbij near the turkish border after the last remaining islamic state fighters inside the city left , a spokesman for the group said on friday .
syria democratic forces ( sdf ) were now sweeping the city after the departure of a remaining group of militants who had been holed up in the city .
they had freed over 2,000 civilian hostages who had been held by the militants , sharfan darwish of the sdf allied manbij military council told reuters .
&quot; the city is now fully under our control but we are undertaking sweeping operations , &quot; he told reuters .
clintons earned $ 10.75 million in 2015 , paid 34.2 percent federal tax rate
hillary clinton on friday released her 2015 tax returns , which showed the democratic presidential nominee and her husband had $ 10.75 million in income that year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent .
in 2015 , the clintons made $ 1 million in charitable contributions , mostly to the clinton foundation ; former president bill clinton brought in nearly $ 5.3 million in speaking fees ; and the former secretary of state reported income of $ 3 million from publisher simon &amp; schuster for her book on her tenure at the state department .
clinton &apos;s running mate , u.s. senator tim kaine of virginia , along with his wife , anne holton , released 10 years of tax returns .
they paid a federal effective tax rate of 20.3 percent in 2015 .
&quot; hillary clinton and tim kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency , &quot; clinton campaign aide jennifer palmieri said in a statement .
in stark contrast , donald trump is hiding behind fake excuses and backtracking on his previous promises to release his tax returns .
it is customary for u.s. presidential candidates to make their tax returns public , although they are not required by law to do so .
trump , a new york businessman , and his lawyers have cited an audit by the internal revenue service as a reason for his refusal to release his returns .
&quot; your move , &quot; clinton campaign aide ian sams said on twitter , linking to the democratic nominee &apos;s returns .
on thursday , trump &apos;s special counsel , michael cohen , told cnn he would not allow trump to release them until the audits are complete .
trump &apos;s critics , including 2012 republican presidential candidate mitt romney and other fellow republicans , have said his refusal raises questions about his net worth , his charitable contributions , his business dealings and various other ties , including with russia .
clinton has pounced on the issue , releasing an online video on friday highlighting high-profile republicans urging trump to release his taxes .
on thursday , she raised the issue during an economic speech in michigan .
&quot; he refuses to do what every other presidential candidate in decades has done and release his tax returns , &quot; she told the crowd .
politico has reported that trump paid zero to very little taxes for two years in the 1990s , and a new york times business columnist on friday quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants saying that could still be the case .
federal tax rates have become an issue in the presidential election .
clinton has endorsed a rule named after billionaire investor warren buffett that would ensure those making more than $ 1 million a year pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent .
president barack obama also backs the proposal .
at a clinton rally last week in omaha , nebraska , buffett , whose berkshire hathaway conglomerate is based there , challenged trump to meet and exchange tax returns .
buffet said that he too was under irs audit and trump is &quot; afraid &quot; not of the tax-collection agency but of voters .
clinton &apos;s campaign has released tax returns going back to 2007 .
the clintons , who now live in chappaqua , new york , paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40.5 percent .
the clintons &apos; 2015 return showed that , unlike most americans , just $ 100 of their income came from wages .
their main investment was a low-cost index mutual fund , and the clintons reported dividend and interest income of $ 109,000 .

chilli-powder condoms , firecrackers boost tanzania elephant protection
conservationists in tanzania are using an unorthodox way of keeping elephants from wandering into human settlements - by throwing condoms filled with chilli powder at them .
the method has proved effective and honeyguide foundation , which hit upon the idea several years ago , with u.s.-based nature conservancy has stepped up its promotion , training volunteers in villages in north tanzania to use a non-violent four-step way of protecting their homes and crops without hurting the animals .
previously many used spears to defend themselves .
friday is world elephant day , which is dedicated to the protection of the animals .
&quot; since we developed the ... toolkit , we have seen an attitude change within these communities whereby they are much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming the elephants , &quot; honeyguide executive director damian bell said in a statement .
the first two steps involve shining a torch at the trespassing elephant and sounding a horn .
if it is not deterred , a so-called &quot; chilli cloud &quot; is thrown .
chilli powder mixed with soil is packed with a firecracker into a condom , its end is twisted shut with just the fuse exposed .
when lit , the condom bursts open with a bang , spraying a fine dust of chilli powder into the air .
one whiff is usually enough to send an elephant the other way .
a last resort is a launcher that shoots a roman candle firework into the air , producing a loud , bright explosion .
32 turkish diplomats who left the country after the coup attempt in july of this year have still not returned to turkey .
this information was presented by turkey ’ s minister of foreign affairs , mevlüt Çavuşoğlu , in a discussion with local journalists .
as a first step , we recalled 208 career diplomats , so that they could continue work in the centre .
32 of them , without objective reasons or explanations , have not returned ’ , said the head of the turkish foreign ministry .
recall that a coup attempt took place in turkey in july .
country authorities officially announced that the coup had failed , and also reported the arrest of more than six thousand people , including senior and mid-level military officials .
according to the ministry of foreign affairs of turkey , 290 people were killed as a result of the coup attempt .
jewish filmmaker slams berlin hotel for removing israel dial code after arab &quot; request &quot; - rt news
a french filmmaker of jewish origin unleashed a media furor after he revealed that the kempinski bristol hotel in berlin does not list israel &apos;s dial code , with employee citing &quot; requests &quot; from arabic customers .
claude lanzmann , an author of holocaust documentary &quot; shoah , &quot; vented his frustration at the kempinski bristol hotel in berlin , writing an open letter in the german outlet faz .
during his recent stay , lanzmann tried to find israel in the list of dial codes provided by the hotel .
the country however was not mentioned among the states one can call directly from the room .
how is it possible , in 2016 in berlin , the capital of the new germany , that israel was eliminated and eradicated ?
lanzmann wrote .
instead , kempinski bristol offers an opportunity to dial israel via an own call center .
seeking explanation , the filmmaker addressed the issue at the hotel &apos;s reception .
the answer he got there , lanzmann wrote &quot; shocked him . &quot;
the hotel &apos;s clerk said that the measure was &quot; a deliberate decision by the management of kempinski-hotels . &quot;
the reason behind the move triggered even more outrage by the filmmaker .
&quot; the majority of our guests are arabs and they demanded israel &apos;s code to be deleted , &quot; the employee was quoted as saying by lanzmann .
israeli ambassador to germany yakov hadas-handelsman called the case a &quot; great shame , &quot; suddeutsche zeitung reports .
we were appalled and shocked by the incident .
it is in itself a great shame .
the fact that it has occurred in germany and at that very hotel chain , is an even greater disgrace .
that needs no explanation .
we expect that the hotel draws the right conclusions , &quot; the official said .
the incident triggered quite a response online , with people calling it a scandal .
some alleged that the kempinski hotel simply &quot; caved in &quot; to the alleged demands of arabic customers .
&quot; shame on you , &quot; another post stated , pointing out that the hotel , located in the noble kurfurstendamm street stands near a synagogue .
the hotel itself was quick to brush off any accusations , calling what happened an &quot; oversight &quot; and &quot; apologizing &quot; to lanzmann , der spiegel reports .
&quot; there was never a direct order &quot; not to include israel in the fast dial list , &quot; suddeutsche zeitung quoted a kempinski representative as saying .
it adds that the code was now added .
police use tear gas &amp; rubber bullets against protesting brazilian students
students clashed with police in the brazilian city of sao paulo on thursday as they gathered to demonstrate against government reforms to the public education system .
police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters .
the trouble started when law enforcement officers tried to disperse the students , which led to the police using rubber bullets and tear gas .
several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their dismay at the plans .
under proposals from the governor of the state of sao paulo geraldo alckmin , just under 100 public schools will be closed , while 300,000 students will be relocated in order to save money .
some of those taking part in the protest could be seen writing graffiti on the walls against the interim president michel temer .
this latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets en masse to support suspended president dilma rousseff as the country &apos;s senate voted for her impeachment .
trade between russia &amp; iran surges 71 % - rt business
with the lifting of sanctions , trade turnover between moscow and tehran has grown 70.9 percent in year-on-year terms , according to russia &apos;s ambassador to iran , levan dzhagaryan .
since international sanctions against iran were lifted , there has been a surge in interest from russian firms in doing business in the country , the ambassador said .
russian companies are resuming existing ties with iran , while new firms are ready to get access to the market .
of course , the further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of the bilateral cooperation with iran , &quot; dzhagaryan said .
he noted that in the first five months of 2016 the trade turnover between russia and iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period of 2015 and amounted to $ 856 million .
in particular , russian exports to iran jumped by 91.5 percent and amounted to $ 697 million .
russian imports from iran increased by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the boost in trade was achieved by supplies of machinery , ground vehicles and weapons , &quot; the ambassador said .
dzhagaryan is also expecting a record number of iranian tourists to visit russia this year .
last year , the russian diplomatic mission in iran issued about 35,000 visas , mostly travel , to iranian citizens .
in addition , for the first time iran entered the top 20 countries by number of tourists visiting russia .
it &apos;s safe to say that last year &apos;s record number of iranian tourists visiting russia will be broken , &quot; he said .
at the same time , relatively few russians are visiting iran , something the ambassador hopes will change .
&quot; i can personally recommend to visit the cities of isfahan , shiraz and yazd that have preserved monuments of ancient persian civilization in good condition , &quot; he said .
the state continues to tighten the screws on the military-industrial complex .
‘ systematic failure to implement ’ the orders of the director general of almaz-antey concern , ‘ shortcomings in work ’ , and ‘ a loss of trust ’ were the grounds for the dismissal .
gennady bendersky has been appointed head of the scientific production association for the next three years .
information about neskorodov &apos;s dismissal only appeared on thursday evening and didn &apos;t evoke a wide response in the media .
how can such silence in the face of a major rearmament of the military be explained ?
most likely , the russian leadership does not want any rumours or negative speculation circulating in the public sphere .
this , once again , confirms that there are many problems within the military-industrial complex ( mic ) , and the government does not want to attract the public &apos;s attention to them .
the removal of neskorodov is undoubtedly an important event from the perspective of restoring order in the industry .
the almaz scientific production association is the concern &apos;s principal enterprise , which specialises in the production of sea and land-based air defence missile systems ( adms ) .
currently , almaz is working on the development of the poliment-redut and morpheus admss , which are slated to be installed on new corvettes , frigates , destroyers , and cruisers .
dmitry kornev , founder of the internet portal , military russia , believes that neskorodov &apos;s dismissal was brought about by a failure to meet the delivery deadlines for these projects .
this theory is the most logical .
for example , the development of morpheus began back in 2007 , and it was expected to be put into commission in 2013 .
poliment-redut is set to be the main antiaircraft defence system on the navy &apos;s newest vessels .
according to the information i &apos;m receiving , over several years of testing , there hasn &apos;t been a single truly successful test .
granted , as far as i can gather , almaz is not entirely to blame for this , kornev said .
the expert fears that a delay could also occur in the commissioning of the s-500 adms .
development and engineering work on the project is still not completed , but the first systems are supposed to be operational in 2016 .
the ministry of defence assured that ‘ work is going according to plan and everything will be completed within the prescribed time limits ’ , although , in 2014 , the department admitted that there are problems with the development of the s-500 .
it is extremely difficult to assess the professional abilities of neskorodov , who had been in charge of almaz since 2011 .
kornev noted that the failure to meet delivery deadlines for the projects could be both a pretext and the reason for the dismissal .
in his opinion , over the past few years , it has become extremely difficult to obtain information about the internal dealings of the military industrial complex and about the management plans of enterprises .
the industry received long-term contracts worth tens of billions of roubles , and , as is well know , big money loves peace and quiet .
as a rule , directors of defence companies resign from a post of their own accord , according to an agreement of mutual understanding between the parties , or are transferred to another job .
in this case , the removal happened publicly , even if it didn &apos;t evoke a response .
this suggests that the head of almaz was , perhaps , an obstinate figure , and resisted an ‘ order ’ issued from above .
it would appear that the state no longer intends to put up with such behaviour .
it will use the shareholders to remove those who prefer to argue with the ministry of defence ’ s directives and do not fulfil assigned tasks .
at the same time , the russian leadership is aiming to punish managers who have been caught stealing ( fraud at the zvezda shipyard ) .
the president is personally paying greater attention to problems in this sector .
vladimir putin heads the military-industrial commission and periodically holds meetings on rearmament .
the kremlin defends a number of managers in the military-industrial complex , with the aim of having a loyal group of directors on hand , who will implement orders received from above .
it &apos;s a far from ideal policy , but amidst rampant corruption and the absence of real competition in the military-industrial complex , the state doesn &apos;t have any other instruments .
of course , the current situation in the defence industry isn &apos;t catastrophic , but the present geopolitical environment is galvanising the kremlin to whip the armed forces into shape as quickly as possible .
alongside the ‘ crackdown ’ on managers in the military-industrial complex , the russian leadership is taking quite successful steps to improve the professionalism of russian troops .
the army &apos;s professional personnel have acquired a new level of quality since the advent of sergei shoigu to the post of defence minister .
you get the impression that the president has taken to heart the famous expression : ‘ if you want peace , prepare for war ’ .
during the cold war , the military might of the ussr and nuclear parity reached in the 1970s , led to the signing of the helsinki pact , which cemented moscow &apos;s sphere of influence on the continent .
for all of the shortcomings of the bipolar system , it worked quite effectively .
the absence of wars on the european continent and the relatively stable situation in the middle east were proof of this .
the triumph of the ‘ winners ’ of the cold war eventually turned into a strengthening of international terrorism .
following a series of terrorist attacks in europe and the united states , there is probably not a single peaceful corner left in the ‘ civilised world ’ .
in spite of this shared peril , the west refuses to engage with russia as an equal partner .
in such circumstances , the only allies our country has left are the navy and the army .
a military build-up will enable moscow to effectively advance national interests and break new ground in global affairs .
scot callum skinner storms home as brits grab cycling gold
scotland &apos;s callum skinner raced to glory in the men &apos;s team sprint at the rio velodrome last night as the team gb trio defended the title from london 2012 .
the glaswegian 23-year-old was in the anchor role that his fellow scotsman sir chris hoy made his own and the youngster did the legend proud as he stormed home to snatch victory from the favoured new zealand outfit .
britain claimed a shock victory four years ago to win as hoy claimed the fifth of his six olympic golds .
and they repeated the trick after finishing a lowly sixth at march &apos;s track world championships in london , despite hoy having since retired .
the issue between beijing and london was replacing specialist starter jamie staff .
they did so just in time as hindes emerged .
hoy &apos;s retirement also created a void which kian emadi and matt crampton tried to fill .
skinner was the man britain &apos;s coaches stuck with , seeing potential in the scot which has now been realised .
hindes , kenny - champions with hoy four years ago - and skinner set an olympic record in qualifying , but the standard was overtaken by new zealand in the first round .
and the british trio won the duel for gold .
hindes was narrowly behind after his lap , but kenny pushed the team in front and skinner held on .
a change of strategy was a big part of the transformation , with hindes riding a bigger gear to slow him down and allow kenny and , in particular , skinner to keep pace .
hoy watched on from his position as a bbc pundit and caught the eye of skinner , kenny and hindes when they stepped on to the podium .
the 23-year-old skinner , from glasgow , said : &quot; it &apos;s a flattering comparison . &quot;
i &apos;m just out there to do my best and make a name for myself .
we set an olympic record in the final and beat the world champions .
it was just incredible .
there &apos;s no better way to win it .
after triumphing at london 2012 alongside kenny and hoy , hindes admitted to deliberately falling to the track following a poor start .
he later retracted the comment and there was no method of appeal from britain &apos;s rivals .
there was no such issue this time around in a supreme victory .
hindes said : &quot; it felt like london , with all the gb flags in the stand . &quot;
we all as a team came together in the last three months .
we &apos;ve been losing out on so many world titles , so to win the olympics again is just amazing .
that is one event , one gold medal for the nation which won seven out of 10 track titles in both beijing and london .
if that is a barometer of the progress made in the last five months , then a successful five days in the velodrome awaits .
with the form kenny demonstrated , it is not beyond the realms of possibility to imagine him repeating hoy &apos;s feat of winning three olympic golds in one games .
that would see kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than hoy , who is also born on 23 march ( that seemingly sacred date in british sport which is also the birthday of steve redgrave , mo farah and roger bannister ) - take his tally to six gold medals and one silver .
that would be the same as hoy &apos;s .
kenny next competes in the sprint , which begins on today and plays out over three days .
the 28-year-old from bolton said : &quot; i &apos;m just enjoying this one for now .
the team event is always the best .
you get to win it with your mates .
it &apos;s a bit lonely winning on your own to be honest .
hindes said : &quot; if he wins another two gold medals , he should get a knighthood . &quot;
it was the day &apos;s only medal event , but there was further good news for britain .
sir bradley wiggins , ed clancy , steven burke and owain doull qualified fastest in the four-man , four-kilometres team pursuit .
they finished in 3 : 51.943 .
the world record , set in winning gold at london 2012 , is 3 : 51.659 .
the first round and final ( 10.42pm ) take place on today &apos;s second day of action , where wiggins is sure to be the focus .
he had a dispute with commissaires yesterday ahead of the qualification ride , when officials summoned him to measure his height .
in the corresponding women &apos;s event , which resumes and concludes tomorrow , laura trott , joanna rowsell shand , elinor barker and katie archibald of milngavie advanced in a world record time , clocking 4 : 13.260 .
team gb have come to rely on its mighty track cycling squad to take ownership of the middle period of an olympic games and deliver a host of medals .
after truly exceptional showings of utter dominance at beijing and london , expectations have been played down in the lead-up to rio .
there have been dramas in the background , not least the resignation of technical director shane sutton in april amid sexism and bullying allegations , and the retirements of giant figures like hoy and victoria pendleton .
however , on the evidence of the first night &apos;s racing in the velodrome , it looks like gb &apos;s now legendary reputation for peaking at the perfect time could be about to be repeated once again .
portland smelter &apos;s future in doubt with axing of power contract
the future of the portland aluminium smelter in victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is in doubt with the power company which supplies the plant disclosing one of the plant &apos;s owners is to terminate a supply contract , with all supply contracts expected to be axed .
the move follows the decision of the victoria government earlier this year to not extend subsidies provided to keep the plant in operation .
a 20-year fixed subsidy expires in november .
up to 2000 jobs may be at risk at alcoa &apos;s portland plant .
as many as 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk with any closure .
and there could be additional knock-on effects since the smelter consumes around 10 per cent of victoria &apos;s entire electricity output .
in 2014 , alcoa closed the point henry smelter which led to the closure last year of the anglesea power plant .
alcoa &apos;s portland smelter is losing money and risks closure .
the moves follows speculation about the future of the plant for several years now , initially in the wake of the strong australian dollar and more recently due to the price for the output from the plant .
agl , which supplies the big aluminium smelter with electricity from its loy yang a power plant in the latrobe valley , said it expects the other three owners will also move to terminate their agreements .
the plant is majority owned by a joint venture of alcoa and alumina , with china &apos;s citic and japan &apos;s marubeni corp holding smaller shares .
&quot; agl expects the portland facility to continue to operate , meaning physical demand for electricity from the smelter will continue , &quot; it said .
agl said the contracts are so-called &apos; hedging contracts &apos; which were due to take effect from november 2016 .
the contracts have a 12-month termination period so they will actually finish in 2017 .
&quot; as such , agl continues to expect the contracts to contribute to earnings in fiscal year 17 , &quot; the power company said .
any potential earnings impact on agl from fy18 onwards is currently limited by the strong futures market outlook for wholesale electricity prices .
agl said it had already written down the value of the contracts in its accounts by $ 187 million in &quot; anticipation of a termination event . &quot;
alcoa said the decision to close out the contracts &quot; does not affect alcoa &apos;s ... ability to operate the smelter or secure electricity supply to the smelter . &quot;
the us company said it entered into a 20-year contract with loy yang in 2010 , which was due to commence from november this year , although it has yet to explain why it has pulled out of the contract .
analysts have been wary of the possible closure of both of the portland smelter in victoria and also the tomago plant near newcastle due to the poor economics of the industry .
addressing analysts earlier in the week , agl &apos;s head of operations , stephen mikkelsen said portland uses around 600 megawatts of power annually and tomago around 900 megawatts .
if both of those plants go from the market that &apos;s a significant reduction in demand in the &#91; electricity &#93; market .
and as a generator that wouldn &apos;t be good for us , &quot; he said .
not just a kardashian reality tv star , kendall &apos;s on the cover of september &apos;s vogue
kendall jenner , 20 , model and fourth daughter of mother-manager kris &apos;s kardashian-jenner clan , is on the cover of us vogue &apos;s coveted september issue .
kendall , who is an estee lauder brand ambassador and has walked in milan , paris and new york fashion weeks , announced the news on her instagram account on thursday .
&quot; in a room with a bunch of people i love , looking at this cover made me cry , &quot; kendall wrote .
the cover revelation was followed by a bizarre ( or simply keeping up with the kardashians-esque ? ) , scripted reality video that featured the entire kardashian-jenner family ( bar troublemakers rob and caitlyn , and joined by everyone &apos;s favourite showbiz uncle , keeping up producer ryan seacrest ) forgetting about their sister &apos;s cover , only to end with the classic twist : they were all planning a surprise party .
it &apos;s the cliche plot line of nearly every &quot; birthday &quot; episode of a children &apos;s television show ( seacrest delivers the line , &quot; you thought we forgot about you ? , &quot; with the sincerity of a cartoon rabbit in an 8am timeslot ) , but kris had to get her other girls in on this publicity somehow .
because , with a spot on vogue &apos;s september issue , we have surely entered a new era of kardashian .
kendall &apos;s big sister kim may have beaten her to the cover of vogue ( she shared it with husband kanye west in april 2014 ) , but the magazine &apos;s september cover is a league unto itself .
the september issue is vogue &apos;s highest selling edition of the year .
with a thickness more closely resembling a coffee table book than a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a huge number of advertisers ( fashionista counted 615 of last year &apos;s 832-page tome as advertising content ) .
the revelation of its cover star is so hotly anticipated that , in the past two years , pictures of the magazine have been leaked before the official announcement .
previous women to feature on the cover include naomi campbell , linda evangelista and kate moss .
in recent years , the cover has certainly featured more &quot; celebrities who model &quot; than &quot; models who are celebrities . &quot;
oscar winner and dior ambassador jennifer lawrence was featured in 2013 , the year after lady gaga had the honour .
but , even on the off-chance that ms jenner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakout model &quot; of her generation - falls into the former category , she is in pretty good company .
these celebrities are not relatives of famous people , or reality stars , or kids these days who know how to make a good snapchat video ( although jenner is all of these things ) .
they are legitimately talented women , excelling in the entertainment industry .
beyonce , who appeared on last year &apos;s cover , has had one of the strongest years of her career with the release of lemonade .
of course , not everyone is pleased about jenner &apos;s success .
with her reality television history , jenner &apos;s position within the fashion world was always going to be fraught .
in june , original victoria &apos;s secret model stephanie seymour criticised jenner and her colleague gigi hadid , calling them the &quot; bitches of the moment . &quot;
this sentiment has boiled up again with the news of jenner &apos;s vogue cover appearance .
but dwelling on the discontent seems beside the point .
kendall jenner is on the cover of the september issue of vogue .
she is a supermodel , in the purest sense of the word .
she &apos;s walking for marc jacobs .
she &apos;s selling you estee lauder foundation .
she , and all of her sisters , are selling you pictures of themselves on their respective paywalled apps .
she &apos;s selling pictures of cindy crawford &apos;s daughter she photographed to love magazine .
and , in her downtime , possibly just as a way still to see sister kourtney and her kids , she &apos;s on reality television .
community legal centres turn away 160,000 people a year
more than 160,000 of the nation &apos;s most vulnerable are turned away from community legal centres every year , with the sector bracing itself for the impact further funding cuts will have on already-stretched operations .
in queensland , three out of five people - mostly the elderly , immigrants , vulnerable workers , victims of violence and those without resources to fight unfair evictions and the like - are already turned away while seeking free legal advice and representation .
community legal services , already stretched beyond limits , are bracing for further cuts .
from june next year , those legal centres are slated to lose another 30 per cent of their federal funding .
director of community legal centres queensland james farrell said the latest national association of community legal centres census report found thousands of people were already being turned away each year .
mr farrell said without a reversal of the federal government decision , the situation was only going to get worse .
&quot; queensland &apos;s community legal centres are chronically underfunded , meaning thousands of people are turned away from the vital services they need , &quot; he said .
people leaving violent relationships , people with unmanageable and crippling debts , families going through separation , workers who are unfairly sacked - all of these people have problems with legal dimensions , and this report shows that they &apos;re not able to get the help they need .
the federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from june 2017 , which means thousands more vulnerable queenslanders will be forced to navigate complex legal problems without help .
we call on the attorney-general , and queensland senator george brandis to immediately reverse these funding cuts , so people can get the help they need when they &apos;re faced with a legal problem .
last year , the state government delivered on its commitment to bring legal aid funding up to the national average .
it &apos;s now time to look at the needs of community legal centres and their client communities , and for the palaszczuk government to invest in this important work .
donald trump campaign sued after staffer allegedly pulled a gun
new york : donald trump &apos;s campaign was sued for allegedly doing nothing after being told that the director of its north carolina operations pulled a gun on a staffer as they drove in a jeep in february .
the incident was described in a lawsuit filed on wednesday in state court in charlotte by vincent bordini , a former software trainer for the state campaign .
bordini said he waited for months for the situation to be handled internally before realising &quot; this was not going to happen . &quot;
the director , earl phillip , &quot; produced a pistol , put his right index finger on the trigger , and drove the barrel into vincent &apos;s knee cap , &quot; bordini said in the complaint .
after complaining to local and regional campaign leadership , bordini learned that at least four other people had experience the same thing with phillip , according to the filing .
&quot; guns don &apos;t have to fire to inflict damage , &quot; bordini said in the complaint .
the suit comes just two days after the republican presidential nominee caused a furore when telling a crowd in north carolina that the &quot; second amendment people &quot; -- understood to be gun owners and gun enthusiasts -- could take action if his rival hillary clinton were elected and gets her pick of judges .
trump &apos;s campaign said the media had taken his words out of context and that he wasn &apos;t advocating violence .
bordini &apos;s complaint seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent supervision , and from phillip for assault , battery and infliction of emotional distress .
trump spokeswoman hope hicks didn &apos;t immediately return a message seeking comment .
attempts to reach phillip were unsuccessful .
wccb , a local news affiliate in charlotte , reported phillip recently left the campaign .
a call left at his consulting firm , innovative consulting services , wasn &apos;t immediately returned .
republican presidential candidate donald trump has run a controversial campaign .
the case is bordini v. donald j. trump for president inc . , 16-cs-14300 , general court of justice , superior court division county of mecklenburg ( charlotte ) .
britain must channel the olympic spirit and expand heathrow
heathrow will also deliver regeneration and prosperity not just in our local communities and across london , but across the country .
for me , this was the great attraction of heathrow , just as it was with london 2012 , where we made enormous efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the olympics achieved huge benefits for stratford and the east end .
and , we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and firms close to heathrow .
for our local communities alone we &apos;ll create 10,000 new apprenticeships , 40,000 new jobs and bring an end to youth unemployment around the airport .
just as there were ahead of london 2012 , there will be those that think the challenge of heathrow expansion is too great .
i was told that britain would be never be ready for the games and that we would be embarrassed on the world stage .
the doubters were wrong on 2012 and they will be proved wrong on heathrow .
there are always obstacles to be overcome , but heathrow is answering every question asked of it .
like the olympics , heathrow is an infrastructure project for the many , not just the few .
expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs , £ 211bn in economic growth , leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the uk .
we have a great team at heathrow who have implemented an £ 11bn programme of infrastructure investment on time and on budget , from t5 - voted the world &apos;s best airport terminal five years in a row , to t2 , built in the middle of the world &apos;s busiest two runways .
now they stand ready to deliver a third runway , backed by £ 16 billion of private investment .
the london 2012 games were a great success for the uk and i am confident that heathrow expansion will be too .
it is time for us to channel that olympic spirit and expand heathrow , securing our trading future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that britain can be proud of .
lord paul deighton is chairman of the heathrow board and former commercial secretary to the treasury
adblock plus , facebook in &quot; cat-and-mouse game &quot; over ad blocking
for companies that make money from online advertising , attempts to circumvent ad-blocking software amount to a &quot; cat-and-mouse game , &quot; according to one of the companies that makes that software .
on thursday , just two days after facebook announced it would be blocking ad blockers on its desktop site , adblock plus published a blog post saying that users could update their filters in its program to block ads on the social network once again .
on tuesday , facebook said that its desktop website would change the coding around its ads in order to make it more difficult for ad blockers to detect which parts of a page are ads .
but adblock now says it has gotten around the new codes .
in a blog post , adblock spokesperson ben williams wrote that &quot; this sort of back-and-forth battle between the open source ad-blocking community and circumventers has been going on since ad blocking was invented , &quot; and that it is possible facebook would come up with its own fix soon .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of just how big a concern ad blockers have become for the industry .
globally , roughly 200 million people use ad blockers , according to a study last year from pagefair and adobe ; nearly quadruple the number who used such software in 2013 .
with 1.03 billion daily active users accessing facebook via mobile devices , mobile advertising now accounts for 84 per cent of facebook &apos;s advertising revenue .
the company is going after ad blockers on desktop however , because mobile ad blockers are not effective in facebook &apos;s mobile apps for the social network and instagram , a spokesperson said .
desktop ads still account for enough revenue that facebook judged such a move to be worth the investment .
also on tuesday , facebook said it would be updating its &quot; ad preferences &quot; tool to give people more control over how ads are targeted to them .
on thursday facebook claimed that adblock &apos;s new filters were concerning because they would also block some non-advertising content on the site .
&quot; this isn &apos;t a good experience for people and we plan to address the issue , &quot; a facebook spokesperson said in an e-mailed statement .
ad blockers are a blunt instrument , which is why we &apos;ve instead focused on building tools like ad preferences to put control in people &apos;s hands .
woman run over on swiss motorway in apparent suicide
the victim was lying on the motorway in the middle of the night .
police are appealing for witnesses after a woman was run over by several vehicles on a motorway in the early hours of thursday in an apparent act of suicide .
the incident happened on the a1 near morges in the canton of vaud just after midnight on thursday .
a woman lay down in the dark on the road &quot; in a desperate act &quot; and was hit by several vehicles , vaud police said in a statement .
clearly looking to kill herself , the victim , a swiss woman aged 49 , was hit by several vehicles including a lorry .
she died at the scene .
several of the drivers involved have already been interviewed but some are still unidentified , said police , who are calling for them and anyone else who witnessed the incident to come forward .
a criminal investigation has been opened , a &quot; logical &quot; step in a situation like this , lawyer gilles hofstetter told le tribune de geneve .
however it remains to be seen if any of the drivers involved will face charges .
was it possible to avoid impact ?
that &apos;s what the prosecutor must determine , &quot; said hofstetter .
two other similar cases in the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible .
in each case - both of which involved a person walking on the motorway in the dark - it was judged that motorists cannot expect to come across a pedestrian on the motorway in the middle of the night , said the paper .
last year a police officer was acquitted of causing death by negligence after she hit and killed a man who was lying on the a1 near paynerne one night in august 2014 .
the 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had passed out on the road , the court heard .
the court found that the policewoman -- who was responding to an emergency call -- was driving in a manner that was justified and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; completely exceptional and unpredictable situation , &quot; the judge said .
anyone with information about thursday &apos;s incident near morges should call police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 .
nasa climate model : venus was once habitable
venus was likely once habitable , according to the projections of a new nasa climate model .
scientists at nasa &apos;s goddard institute for space studies developed a model to explore venus &apos; past using tools and algorithms similar to those employed by climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine whether or not venus , with its hot , water-less surface and co2-chocked atmosphere , might have once hosted earth-like conditions .
scientists have previously suggested that venus &apos; slow rotation rate is explained by its thick atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggests venus could have boasted a thin , earth-like atmosphere and still spun slowly .
the model also looked at the topography of early venus .
the planet likely featured more dry regions than earth , but once had enough water and geographical variability to host life and guard against rapid evaporation .
early venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent dimmer .
&quot; in the giss model &apos;s simulation , venus &apos; slow spin exposes its dayside to the sun for almost two months at a time , &quot; giss scientist anthony del genio explained in a news release .
this warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heating .
the result is mean climate temperatures that are actually a few degrees cooler than earth &apos;s today .
the model produced a story of venus similar to the evolution previously hypothesized by planetary scientists .
though likely once habitable , venus was -- over the course of several billion years -- exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light .
its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light .
as its hydrogen escaped , all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deathly greenhouse gas effect -- thus , the venus we know today .
researchers shared the results of their new venus climate model in the journal geophysical research letters .
patrick roy resigns as avalanche coach
patrick roy resigned as coach and vice president of the hockey operations of the colorado avalanche on thursday , citing a lack of a voice within the team &apos;s decision-making process .
colorado executive vice president / general manager joe sakic confirmed the move and noted that the club will begin a search for a new coach immediately .
&quot; for the past three years , i have carried out my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the colorado avalanche with energy , passion and determination , &quot; the 50-year-old roy said in the statement .
i have thought long and hard over the course of the summer about how i might improve this team to give it the depth it needs and bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the vision of the coach and vp-hockey operations needs to be perfectly aligned with that of the organization .
he must also have a say in the decisions that impact the team &apos;s performance .
these conditions are not currently met .
sakic , who hired roy on may 23 , 2013 , thanked roy for his contributions to the team .
&quot; patrick informed me of his decision today , &quot; sakic said .
we appreciate all he has done for our organization and wish him the best of luck in the future .
roy was named the jack adams award winner as the league &apos;s best coach during his rookie season with the avalanche in 2013-14 .
he guided the club to 112 points and a first-place finish in the central division , but colorado was upset by minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and has missed the postseason in each of the last two years .
the avalanche posted a 39-39-4 mark in 2015-16 and fell five points shy of the wild for the second wild-card spot in the western conference .

labor strikes over pay for north sea oil workers are suspended while all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks , lead negotiators said .
strikes against oilfield services company wood group have been staged sporadically on platforms in the north sea operated by royal dutch shell .
&quot; wood group and the unite and rmt unions can confirm we have agreed to restart the process for resolution of the current dispute , &quot; a joint statement read .
we will hold a number of full-day meetings over the next few weeks , starting early next week , to take a fresh look at the issues .
the labor unions said their recent action , which they said is the first in more than 25 years , was in protest of potential pay cuts of up to 30 percent .
wood group this year cut rates paid to its north sea contractors by about 9 percent because of negative market pressures .
the company &apos;s rate reduction follows a 10 percent decrease for onshore contractors in 2014 .
the company said additional cuts would give the company the room needed to move through the market downturn .
shell , for its part , has trimmed thousands of people from its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations in the wake of its mega-merger with british energy company bg group .
energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices , an economic situation compounded by the british decision in june to leave the european union .
scottish member of parliament dave anderson met with labor leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes to strike the north sea in a generation .
the north sea , he said , is vital for the regional economy .
&quot; in the north sea and right across the country , we need an economy that works for the many and not just the few , &quot; he said in a statement .
less than $ 1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the north sea is expected in 2016 , compared with an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
kepler measures spin rates of stars in pleiades cluster
the latest mission by the kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of spin rates among the stars of the pleiades cluster .
the new data is helping astronomers understand why stars in the cluster spin at varying rates , as well as how rotation periods relate to planet formation .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results to other star clusters , we will learn more about the relationship between a star &apos;s mass , its age , and even the history of its solar system , &quot; luisa rebull , a research scientist at caltech &apos;s infrared processing and analysis center in pasadena , said in a news release .
the pleiades cluster is situated 445 light-years from earth .
many of the stars in the cluster are just now reaching adulthood , having been born roughly 125 million years ago .
they &apos;re spinning as fast as they ever will .
at their peak spin rates , these maturing stars eject large amounts of stellar wind .
as these winds travel across the stars &apos; magnetic fields , they enact a braking effect on the stars .
as a star ages , its spin rate begins to slow down .
kepler measures each star &apos;s spin rate by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable starspots -- like sunspots .
the latest catalog of spin rates suggests more massive stars spin more slowly than less massive stars .
rebull likens the stars to dancers , larger ones pirouetting more slowly than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &apos; ballet &apos; of the pleiades , we see that slow rotators tend to be more massive , whereas the fastest rotators tend to be very light stars , &quot; said rebull .
because the pleiades cluster is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities with spin rates .
&quot; the pleiades star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation going both directions , younger and older , &quot; said rebull .
we still have a lot we want to learn about how , when and why stars slow their spin rates and hang up their &apos; dance shoes , &apos; so to speak .
rebull and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of pleiades spin rates in three new papers , soon to be published in the astronomical journal .
two agencies are conducting an investigation into the activities of a group of ukrainian saboteurs detained in crimea , kommersant writes .
the fsb is collecting evidence linking the detained individuals to the organisation of subversive activities in crimea .
as previously reported , a confession was made by evgeny panov , a resident of the ukrainian city of energodar , who agreed to cooperate with the investigation .
according to him , he considered the titan chemical plant in armyansk , the oil depot in feodosia , the kerch ferry crossing , the gas pipeline , as well as one of the military airfields as potential targets for sabotage .
law enforcement officials believe that far from all of the saboteurs &apos; accomplices have been apprehended .
this , in particular , served as grounds for arrest of the suspects at the kiev district court in simferopol , the publication notes .
stanislav cherchesov has become the head coach of the russian national football team
a decision was made at a meeting of the executive committee of the russian football union to appoint stanislav cherchesov to the post of head coach of the russian national football team .
the contract with him will last for two years , until the end of the 2018 world cup .
on 11 august , the executive committee of the rfu appointed stanislav cherchesov to the post of head coach of the russian national football team .
he is a well-known footballer , who formerly played for spartak moscow in the position of goalkeeper , and is also a coach with solid experience , who was the trainer for such russian teams as the one and very same spartak , zhemchuzhina-sochi , terek , amkar , dynamo , and also legia warsaw , which won the national championship and the country &apos;s cup .
it is reported that the contract with cherchesov will be signed in the near future and that it will last two years .
as such , the responsibility falls on him to prepare the team for the 2018 world championship .
it &apos;s known that miroslav romaschenko , gintaras staučė , and vladimir panikov will be part of his coaching staff .
there is information that suggests that the salaries for the whole coaching staff will amount to 2.6 billion euros a year .
according to media sources , the leadership of the rfu has set a goal for stanislav cherchesov to get the russian national team to the semi-finals and to win medals .
the coach himself stated that he considers creating a competitive environment on the team as a matter of priority and is going to give the football players an opportunity to prove themselves .
furthermore , according to cherchesov , he &apos;s happy that he was the one chosen .
the russian team will have its first match under the direction of cherchesov on 31 august , in antalya : it will be a friendly match against the turkish team .
recall that the post of head coach of the russian national football team was previously held by leonid slutsky , who combined it with coaching the cska club .
he announced his resignation after a disastrous performance by the russia national team at euro 2016 in france .
having said that , he took personal responsibility for the team &apos;s poor showing .
sandwiched between angola and south africa , namibia suffered greatly during the long struggle against apartheid .
however , after attaining independence from south africa in 1990 , this country , with a population of 2.4 million people , has achieved tremendous success , especially over the past few years .
the main reason for namibia &apos;s success is that the government pays a lot of attention to education .
while people in developed countries take for granted free primary and secondary education , in many poor countries , secondary and even elementary schools require tuition fees .
furthermore , governments are often advised to introduce fees for education for the purpose of ‘ cost recovery ’ .
in namibia , however , education in primary schools is free .
moreover , starting in 2015 , secondary education also became free .
the country &apos;s leaders are also actively working on other important areas .
efforts to eliminate malaria have reduced the number of annual cases by 97 % over the past ten years .
in contrast to the international trend of growing inequality , in namibia , it is shrinking .
compared to the figure for 1993 , the gini coefficient , which is the standard measure of inequality in income distribution , fell by 15 points .
back then , 23 years ago , this figure was one of the highest in the world .
while the poverty rate has fallen from 69 % in 1993 , to less than 30 % .
the number of people living in conditions of abject poverty ( less than $ 1.90 a day ) has also fallen from almost 53 % to less than 23 % .
namibia also has the highest rating for freedom of speech in africa , according to reporters without borders .
the country is significantly ahead of the united states and other wealthy countries .
additionally , the country has a favourable rating , one of the highest in africa , in the corruption perceptions index , which is compiled by human rights activists from transparency international .
even now , when commodity prices are falling , namibia manages to maintain high growth rates .
meanwhile , the debt-to-gdp ratio is around 25 % , which is less than a 1 / 3 of the level of debt in the united states and in the majority of european countries .
of course , namibia still has some problems .
the unemployment rate , at least according to traditional assessment methods , still remains quite high at almost 28 % .
also , as with other countries in the region , there is a high incidence of hiv / aids in namibia : almost 17 % of the population are infected .
according to the world bank , namibia belongs to the group of upper middle-income countries , but the authorities insist that their state is actually a developing country .
namibia , of course , faces some difficulties that are typical of underdeveloped economies .
the state has to develop a very big and arid country with a small population .
isolated nomadic tribes of hunter-gatherers , which somehow need to be integrated into modern society without losing their identity , live throughout the country in deserts .
the integration of people who , a quarter of a century ago , were on the periphery of the world economy , is a difficult task for any country .
it is even more difficult for namibia : like every other country in the world , it is being faced with the consequences of climate change .
however , namibia never thought of giving up ; the country is dealing with the problems it faces .
almost immediately after attaining independence , the authorities got to work on creating a diversified economy and a cohesive society .
it is noteworthy that competing political factions came together to work for the common good .
indeed , namibia provides inexpensive medical services not only to its own citizens , but also to its neighbours .
about 15-20 % of visitors to medical facilities in the northern areas of namibia are angolan citizens .
no one in namibia talks about building a wall that would separate the country from its poor and corrupt neighbours .
namibians understand that you can &apos;t choose your neighbours , and , as such , decided not to pick a fight with them , but to cooperate instead : to share scarce water resources , to participate in regional health projects , to promote investments and the exchange of students .
in addition to this , the namibian government rightly decided that rich natural resources can just as easily become a curse , contributing to the enrichment of a few at the expense of many .
the authorities understand that the profits from namibia &apos;s natural resources need to be invested in infrastructure and production capacity .
they also realise that it would be irresponsible not to try and maximise profits from the sale of the country &apos;s resources , and are revising investment laws and production contracts to make sure that this is being done .
transparency is critical to this process , and that is why the government &apos;s strong support for freedom of speech is so important .
as the head of state , hage geingob , noted , the media often says things he doesn &apos;t like .
but after the struggle for freedom from apartheid in south africa , namibia needs to protect the freedoms it has gained , the president says .
not all of namibia &apos;s key resources are non-renewable .
some of them , such as the fishing industry , are renewable , and the government is making every effort to preserve and strengthen them .
every year , more than a million foreign tourists visit the country .
namibia demonstrates that even those countries that begin with serious flaws – racism , colonial systems , inequality , and a low level of development – can embark on a path to shared prosperity .
its achievements deserve international recognition and emulation .
many have heard about the ‘ varna gold ’ , the earliest gold objects created by man ( 4600-4200 bc ) .
it was probably the biggest archaeological sensation of the 1970s : in bulgaria , during excavations of the varna necropolis , a fantastic number of gold artefacts were found - more than three thousand with a total weight of 6 kilogrammes .
990 gold objects , weighing more than 1.5 kg , were recovered from just one burial site , known as ‘ grave no. 43 ’ .
however , the official title of oldest gold in the world may soon be handed over to a rather insignificant-looking bead found by archaeologists in july of this year .
notably , it was also found in bulgaria , in a prehistoric settlement known as tell yunatsite .
unlike varna , a port city , tell yunatsite is located inland , near the village of yunatsite in pazardzhik district .
the bead is made from a gold band rolled into a ring .
yavor boyadzhiev , leader of the excavation at tell yunatsite , has dated the find at 4600 bc and said that it &apos;s older than the gold of varna by at least 200 years .
the treasures of varna , you will recall , date from around the same period , 4600-4200 bc .
currently , no technology exists that makes it possible to date metal with perfect accuracy .
so , where is the certainty about which gold is more ancient coming from ?
obviously , professor boyadzhiev knows more than he told reuters news agency : ‘ i am absolutely sure that the yunatsite gold is older than the varna gold ’ .
this is a discovery of extraordinary importance : it looks like a tiny object , but it is big enough to take its rightful place in history .
in an interview with reuters , boyadzhiev announced that , in the near future , scientists will analyse the composition of the metal , and will once again examine , and this time more thoroughly , the archaeological layer where the gold artefact was found .
this will help to date the bead as accurately as possible .
the location of the find also explains a lot .
tell yunatsite is a well-known settlement , even if you &apos;ve never heard of it .
currently , tell yunatsite is considered to be the most ancient ‘ city ’ in europe .
tell was founded by the descendants of people who migrated to europe from anatolia ( modern turkey ) in the 7th millennium bc .
over the course of the following centuries , metalworking rapidly developed in this region : from the acquisition of the first metallurgical skills , to the creation of a full-fledged industry .
in the local historiography , there is a special name for this archaeological community : the balkan-carpathian metallurgical province .
in the 5th millennium bc , urban settlements started to emerge around the metalworking centres .
now they are called the most ancient cities of europe .
tell yunatsite is quite possibly the most ancient of them all , given that artefacts from 4900 bc have been found here .
i would call tell yunatsite a prototype of the modern city , despite the fact that it is a very ancient settlement , even compared to mesopotamia .
‘ this place is older than sumer by a thousand years ’ , says boyadzhiev , bearing in mind the generally accepted view that urban culture originated in southern mesopotamia , which is modern iraq .
that is where the first cities , in the usual sense of the word , arose .
the excavation of tell yunatsite has been underway since 1976 .
during this time , archaeologists have excavated almost 12 hectares , which is about one third of the total estimated area of the settlement .
the remains of a fortress wall , which , at one time , reached a height of three metres , were discovered .
little has survived from the houses and workshops , but archaeologists can distinctly make out streets , public buildings , dense urban housing , a ‘ business centre ’ , and residential suburbs .
tell yunatsite is often called the ‘ bird city ’ : dozens of clay bird figurines were found here .
all of the birds were depicted at rest , hence the assumption that they were not decorative objects , but rather the subject of a local cult .
the ‘ bird city ’ was destroyed around 4100 bc , possibly by indo-european tribes that came from the northeast .
the nomads didn ’ t have cities , but did have horses and weapons .
the three-metre-high fortress walls didn &apos;t stop them .
archaeologists have discovered obvious signs of a brutal massacre : the remains of elderly people , women , and children , with evidence of wounds inflicted by battle-axes , were found inside of the houses .
new discoveries and new facts are emerging every year , changing the accepted understanding of the ancient history of mankind .
bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly talking not about individual cultures , but about the ‘ lost ’ first civilisation of europe that originated in the balkans .
the ‘ varna gold ’ , found relatively recently , in 1972 , became a powerful stimulus in the search for this civilisation .
it is logical that something had to precede the golden luxury of varna : something like a tiny gold bead created in tell yunatsite .
porsche has artificially aged the 911 targa model
it has been officially announced that the 911 targa 4s exclusive design is being hand-finished by experts from the division that works with production vehicles .
the ‘ retro look ’ is achieved , for example , by using the special blue etna colour on the body , which was developed back in 1960 for the porsche 356b model ; even the logo of this model is painted in this colour .
additionally , the targa received the signature white graphics along its sides and special 20-inch rs spyder wheel rims , as well as some parts of the body design painted in ‘ white-gold metallic ’ .
the retro feel is considerably less noticeable in the interior : essentially , it is distinguished by its grey-blue tones , the new power seats with extended range , and finishes like the black anodised steel door sill guards with the logo of the division .
to top it off , when purchasing this limited edition , each buyer will receive a free vehicle cover and a richly decorated album containing photographs of the production process .
the experts at porsche exclusive didn &apos;t even lay their hands on the powertrain : the characteristics of the retro targa are exactly the same as the standard production model .
it is equipped with a 3.0-litre , six-cylinder turbocharged engine , producing 420 hp and 500 nm .
the most dynamic version is the 911 targa 4s , which is capable of accelerating to 100 km / h in 4 seconds .
the porsche 911 targa 4s exclusive design will be released as a limited edition , but neither the number , nor the cost of each specific sports car have been reported .
facebook and ad blockers have unleashed an ‘ arms race ’
facebook &apos;s recent introduction of a technology , which prevents the hiding of advertisements on pages of the social network , has sparked a tit-for-tat response from developers of ad-blocking technologies .
adblock plus has released an ‘ antidote ’ , but facebook plans on making even this useless before long .
so , adblock plus advertised their new technology , which is unlikely to remain effective for long
representatives from the social network noted that , in an effort circumvent the new technology of ‘ unblockable ’ advertisements , adblock plus &apos; technology also blocks regular posts from friends and pages in addition to commercials .
facebook expressed regret about the policy of adblock plus and promised to fix the problem shortly .
a source within the developers of the social network told the publication , ‘ techcrunch ’ , that a code , which will make adblock plus useless on the desktop version of facebook , will be ready within the next few hours .
in this way , the social network and blockers unleashed a kind of ‘ arms race ’ , trying to one-up each other : the aggrieved party turned out to be the users , who missed interesting posts from their friends or saw advertisements where they weren &apos;t used to seeing them .
the ethical aspects of blocking advertisements have caused heated arguments as of late .

dongfeng will bring the fengguang 370 crossvan and the rich new pickup truck to russia – za rulem website www.zr.ru
the dongfeng fengguang 370 is representative of a class of automobiles , combining the advantages of a minivan and a crossover , which is gaining popularity in china .
another new model announced for russia is the rich new pickup truck .
many western companies decided to ignore the moscow international motor show this year , so chinese companies will fill up the empty spaces at crocus expo &apos;s exhibition halls .
in particular , a strong showing will be made by the dongfeng motor corporation , which has big plans for the russian market and intends to offer our car enthusiasts a number of interesting new models in the near future .
one of them will be the dongfeng fengguang 370 crossvan , which went on sale in china this spring at a price of 55,900 yuan ( slightly less than 550 thousand roubles at the current exchange rate ) .
it &apos;s doubtful that russian citizens will every see it at that price , and the issue of delivery into our country is still in the discussion stage .
in china , by the way , the fengguang 370 managed to take 11th place on the list of best-selling minivans according to june sales , even though , given its high ground clearance ( 175 mm ) and protective , plastic lower-body moulding , it could also be classified as a crossover .
the crossvan is built on the front-wheel drive platform of the older fengguang 360 model : the 370 has the same wheelbase , 2,725 mm , but its body is slightly longer ( 4,565 mm to 4,510 mm ) , it has a more solid design , and is better equipped .
the interior is decorated with wood panelling , but a photo showing a large vertical touch screen , ‘ like a tesla ’ , in the centre console was only included in the early exhibition models of the crossvan , whereas the ‘ sound system ’ in vehicles for sale is more basic .
five of the seven seats easily fold to produce a flat loading area with a length of 1,650 mm , while the maximum trunk capacity is 1,500 l .
the fengguang 370 is fitted with just one 1.5 l gasoline ‘ aspirated ’ engine , with 115 hp of output , connected to a 5-speed manual transmission .
the manufacturer is coyly silent about the performance qualities of the car , but promises to be merciful on the owner &apos;s budget with an appetite of just 6.7 l / 100 km .
the rich new pickup truck is familiar to russians as the previous generation nissan np300 navara , but with a design that has been slightly refined by chinese stylists .
in spite of the outdated design , this model still enjoys a steady demand among chinese consumers as a reliable and low-maintenance ‘ workhorse ’ .
at a similar price , the rich new will surely be of interest to russians , because modern japanese pickups have become prohibitively expensive .
the rich new comes equipped with two choices of engines : a 2.4 l gasoline engine ( 137 hp ) or a 2.5 l turbodiesel engine ( 116 hp ) .
it only comes in a standard transmission with rear-wheel drive , but there are upgrades and an option of part-time 4wd .
the new flagship a9 sedan will also be at the dongfeng booth ; a representative from the chinese company announced its russian premiere back in june .
there are increasingly more minivan-type crossovers in the chinese market ; some of the latest new models are the cowin v3 and the x7 swm .
currently , dongfeng &apos;s russian line consists of two models : the s30 sedan and the h30 cross hatchback .
over the first seven months of this year , dealers for the chinese company sold 696 vehicles in our country .
transport tax notices will no longer be sent by mail – za rulem website www.zr.ru
the tax inspectorate has changed the procedure for sending tax assessment notices .
all russian automobile owners have become accustomed to the system , which has not changed in years : in the summer and fall , they receive a transport tax bill in the mail for the previous year .
however , this year , many of them will be waiting for nothing .
the fact is that the tax inspectorate has quietly changed the procedure for notifying citizens .
those who signed up for a ‘ personal taxpayer account ’ on the agency &apos;s official website , nalog.ru , will receive notifications in electronic form .
the inspectorate automatically considered those russians citizens as online users and deleted them from the standard ‘ paper ’ mailing list .
this new way of doing things will affect all owners of vehicles and real estate .
everyone else will receive the same familiar letters as before .
however , it is possible for website account holders to go back to the old system .
to do this , they must visit an office of the tax service during august and file a request .
on the one hand , the new process is more modern and convenient .
a notification will appear on the ‘ personal account ’ right after it is prepared , whereas a letter will have to travel several days and can even be lost altogether .
on top of that , the number of users of the tax inspectorate &apos;s internet service has grown to more than 18 million people , which enables the agency to save substantially on postage .
on the other hand , the meagre news on the inspectorate &apos;s website is clearly insufficient to inform citizens about the changed process .
some people could have registered for a ‘ personal account ’ for a one-time service and have long since forgotten about it .
these people will not receive notification by mail and , without knowing it , will fall into the same category as tax evaders , with all the ensuing consequences .
access to the ‘ personal taxpayer account ’ can be achieved three ways : through a user account on the gosuslugi.ru portal , by using an electronic signature , or by entering the login and password specified on a registration card .
the latter can be obtained in-person at any tax office ( regardless of place of registration ) .
it bears reminding that , this year , the transport tax must be paid by 1 december .
the mail out of notifications began in july .
the souped-up mercedes-benz g class , whose improvements are aimed at achieving very high performance , is a thing in itself .
but the controversial concept did not confound the experts at the company , g-power , who tackled the redesign of the sport version of the mercedes-amg g 63 .
g-power is known for its proclivity for bmw vehicles , but , at the end of the day , to their experts , a vehicle is a vehicle .
indeed , why not improve the g 63 : a 571-hp flying sledgehammer , with the aerodynamics of a tank , that goes from zero to a hundred in 5.4 seconds ?
to beef up the ‘ muscles ’ of this crazy ‘ gelik ’ , the experts took advantage of the benefits offered by the 5.5-litre supercharged v8 engine .
well , the speed at which it accelerates from zero to a hundred improved by an indiscernible 0.1 second : now the flying ‘ brick ’ is capable of hitting 100 in 5.3 seconds .
mind you , acceleration at average speeds is , for sure , discernibly easier for it .
the top speed is terrifying : while the standard g 63 can &apos;t go faster than 210 km / h , the souped-up suv , with a deactivated electronic ‘ collar ’ , is capable of hitting 250 km / h .
from the outside , the vehicle is almost indistinguishable from the factory original , with the exception of different wheel rims : 23-inch hurricane rr with 305 / 35zr23 size tyres .
the luxury division , mercedes-maybach , has announced a striking , 6-metre-long concept coupe , which will be unveiled at the concours d &apos;elegance in pebble beach .
mercedes-benz intends to compete with the ‘ green sub-brand ’ , bmw i , and will promote their electric models under a separate brand .
in the coming years , the debut of at least four new eco-friendly models is expected .
