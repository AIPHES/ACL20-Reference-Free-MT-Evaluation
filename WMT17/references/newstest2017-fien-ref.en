28-year-old chef found dead at san francisco mall
a 28-year-old chef who had recently moved to san francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall this week .
but the victim &apos;s brother says he can &apos;t think of anyone who would want to hurt him , saying , &quot; things were finally going well for him . &quot;
the body found at the westfield mall wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old san francisco resident frank galicia , the san francisco medical examiner &apos;s office said .
the san francisco police department said the death was ruled a homicide and an investigation is ongoing .
the victim &apos;s brother , louis galicia , told abc station kgo in san francisco that frank , previously a line cook in boston , had landed his dream job as line chef at san francisco &apos;s sons &amp; daughters restaurant six months ago .
a spokesperson for sons &amp; daughters said they were &quot; shocked and devastated &quot; by his death .
&quot; we are a small team that operates like a close knit family and he will be dearly missed , &quot; the spokesperson said .
our thoughts and condolences are with frank &apos;s family and friends at this difficult time .
louis galicia said frank initially stayed in hostels , but recently , &quot; things were finally going well for him . &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he was dating a girl , &quot; louis galicia told kgo .
louis galicia said he could not think of anyone who would want to hurt his younger brother .
he was a kind spirit with a big heart .
his way of connecting with the family was always making us a dish , making us dinner , &quot; louis galicia said .
he never wanted to be in any kind of altercation .
he was the brother that went with the flow .
&quot; with everything else that &apos;s going wrong with the world , he was that diamond in the rough that was shining bright every day , &quot; he said .

junior doctors strike : calls for fresh industrial action
representatives of junior doctors have called on their union to authorise fresh industrial action in their dispute about a new contract .
the junior doctors committee ( jdc ) of the british medical association ( bma ) is to ask its full council to back more industrial action from early september .
the jdc says ministers have failed to address concerns about the contract .
junior doctors and medical students voted in july to reject a contract deal agreed with the bma .
it was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the ballot .
in a letter to members released on twitter on thursday night , the jdc &apos;s chair ellen mccourt said the government had remained &quot; persistently silent &quot; on issues which , she said , had resulted in the contract being rejected .
she said : &quot; in light of this , the jdc executive has voted to reject the proposed new contract in full and to call for formal re-negotiations on all of your concerns . &quot;
in response to the government &apos;s silence , jdc exec has today made a formal request for a special meeting of bma council to authorise a rolling programme of escalated industrial action beginning in early september .
the dispute has led to junior doctors taking part in six strikes this year , including the first all-out stoppages in the history of the nhs .
the bma &apos;s junior doctor leader , dr johann malawana , resigned following the vote to reject the negotiated terms of the contract , which the bma had recommended .
he had told bma members the deal was a good one that should be accepted , during meetings ahead of the poll of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students .
following the vote , health secretary jeremy hunt said the contract would be imposed on medics in england .
russia and turkey : an &apos; alliance of misfits &apos; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of russia and turkey met on tuesday to shake hands and declare a formal end to an eight-month long war of words and economic sanctions .
but , as vladimir putin greeted his turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of a st. petersburg palace , i got the distinct impression that ankara wants this reconciliation the most .
there was the handshake , yes .
but mr putin &apos;s smile looked thin and he was hardly oozing warmth even by his own restrained standards .
recep tayyip erdogan by contrast talked repeatedly of his &quot; dear friend &quot; mr putin - five times , according to one report .
i lost count .
he also pledged that relations with russia would return not just to their pre-crisis level , but even higher .
the next day one newspaper here described mr erdogan as acting as if nothing bad had ever happened .
to me , his enthusiasm implied the opposite .
but a lingering coolness emanating from mr putin showed that russia &apos;s leader has forgotten nothing .
in fact , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening comments : turkey &apos;s shooting down of a russian fighter plane on the syrian border .
moscow &apos;s reaction at the time was furious .
mr putin lashed out , accusing ankara of stabbing moscow in the back .
the offence was even greater , coming from a supposed friend .
rebuilding real trust will be hard , perhaps impossible .
russian public opinion has also turned since november .
for months , state-controlled media conducted a staggering , all-out offensive against ankara .
all of a sudden , it seemed like turks were to blame for everything .
most serious were accusations from top officials that mr erdogan &apos;s own family has profited from an illegal trade in oil from areas of syria controlled by the so-called islamic state .
he &apos;s denied that emphatically .
but in st. petersburg came the official message that it &apos;s time to move on .
after all , this meeting only happened because mr putin got the apology he demanded from president erdogan .
russia could claim a victory of sorts .
for ankara the benefits of calling a truce are clear .
first and foremost , erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ousted from power last month in a failed coup .
repeat terror attacks on turkey have clearly shaken him too .
there is also an economic motive .
russian sanctions have hit hard - particularly the ban on charter flights , which usually carry several million russian tourists to the turkish coast each year .
the number has slumped by almost 90 % .
as for russia , tour operators and charter companies here will certainly be relieved when flights eventually resume .
they &apos;re banking on a late-season rush to the mediterranean .
and even this week , state tv has been predicting cheaper fruit and vegetables once turkish agricultural imports are permitted again .
&quot; tourists that way , tomatoes back here , &quot; as a report in vedemosti newspaper phrased it .
but the visit also had additional political value for moscow .
ankara is angry with the west for what it considers a weak response to the attempted takeover .
add to that its long-standing grudge at the snail &apos;s pace of talks to join the eu and step in mr putin - who is keen to capitalise on the chill and chip away at turkey &apos;s ties with the west .
the russian leader certainly won bonus points with ankara for calling in support of the elected authorities after the attempted coup .
mind you , that &apos;s a given for moscow which has its own deep-seated fear of regime change .
so the summit at this glitzy , seaside palace allowed russia and turkey to present what one analyst described to me as an &quot; alliance of misfits &quot; : two countries that feel rejected and mistreated by the west , joining forces .
still , despite the public display of reconciliation , the two still have major differences .
the key one is syria , where moscow has recently been casting itself as peacemaker but where russia and turkey back opposite sides .
it could be telling that after almost three hours of initial talks , the two presidents told a press conference that they hadn &apos;t even touched on the topic .
turkey &apos;s president deliberately avoided answering a question on their differences , while mr putin chose to underline them .
there is no clear consensus on where they can seek common ground on syria .
but after months of open hostility - and given the potential for utter disaster when nato member turkey shot down that russian fighter jet - it is surely better that the two leaders are at least talking again .
royal bank of scotland to disappear for customers outside scotland
the brand rbs is to be reduced to a back office role , according to the bank &apos;s chief executive .
royal bank of scotland will disappear for customers outside scotland .
ross mcewan told bbc scotland that the rbs brand was associated with the bank &apos;s global ambitions .
it has retreated from them since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be bailed out .
during that time , brand strategists have used &apos; rbs &apos; to protect other consumer finance brands .
it was backed with millions of pounds in sponsorship of international sport , from six nations rugby to wimbledon champion andy murray .
but now , it has been judged right to let more national brands come to the fore .
royal bank of scotland will be used with scottish customers , but will not be initialised .
in england and wales , all rbs references , outside head office and the stock exchange listing , will be changed to natwest .
the ulster bank brand is already used for customers in the republic of ireland and northern ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for private banking , which will get more prominence - coutts , adam &amp; co , drummond , and holt &apos;s military bank .
mr mcewan was interviewed during a tour of customers and staff in inverness-shire .
he told bbc scotland : &quot; the rbs brand will end up becoming our investor brand and the one that our staff are employed with , because we are now becoming much more a bank of brands . &quot;
as the bank itself became a global brand , rbs became the global brand .
i &apos;m now saying we no longer have global aspirations , we have local aspirations .
each one of those brands will stand for something quite different in their own communities , and our staff will work with customers under those brands .
rbs had already stated that it would not to continue its six nations sponsorship , and it has been raising the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship .
&quot; the time is right for us to move to the bank of brands , because underneath ( we &apos;ve been asking ) how do we focus on making this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the chief executive .
it would have been very cynical three years ago if we &apos;d said we &apos;re going to be a great bank for customers and put those brands out there .
but with the work we &apos;ve been doing , focussing on the customers needs , not our own , i think you &apos;re seeing a lot of change .
we can bring those brands back up again , so i think the time is right .
frankie dettori reaches 3,000 winners with victory at newmarket on predilection
dettori sprays champagne after a double at newmarket takes him to 3,000 wins
jockey frankie dettori secured his 3,000th british winner at newmarket on friday .
he brought up the landmark with his second winner of the night at his local track - on predilection , trained by john gosden .
the 45-year-old italian is the sixth jockey to reach the landmark in flat racing .
he follows sir gordon richards , doug smith , lester piggott , pat eddery and willie carson .
three-time champion jockey dettori , who earlier won on ghayyar , said : &quot; it &apos;s special . &quot;
i &apos;m very emotional because my family are here as well
i &apos;m very pleased for it to have happened at newmarket because this is where i landed 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not a royal ascot - it &apos;s a mundane friday night with 20,000 people .
i &apos;m relieved and very humble .
dettori soaks up the cheers as he brings in predilection after victory
two jockeys have reached the milestone in jump racing - champion jockey richard johnson and retired 20-time champion sir anthony mccoy , who had more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career .
lester piggott , nine-time derby winner , 4,493 career wins
frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era and it is no surprise he has reached this landmark so few have achieved before him .
he is stylish and strong , but it is his tactical nous that sets him apart from others in the weighing room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for racing , his enthusiasm and charisma have been drawing fans to the sport for years .
i said to frankie a few weeks ago at epsom he &apos;d have ridden 6,000 winners if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big-race jockey !
seriously though , frankie &apos;s been riding winners in the uk for the best part of 30 years which is great to see .
he &apos;s a lively character which is good for british racing but more than that , he &apos;s an incredible jockey .
frankie dettori celebrated the milestone with a trademark flying dismount
from flying finishes to flying dismounts , frankie dettori has been the poster boy of british flat racing for two decades .
it has been a rollercoaster ride .
stacks of big-race winners , including his famous 1996 &apos; magnificent seven &apos; at ascot , but he also survived a plane crash and served a drugs ban .
three years ago he initially struggled when returning from that six-month suspension , but he showed formidable strength of character to defy the doubters and return to his best .
and he may not be done for some time - dettori has previously said he would like to carry on competing until the age of 50 , at least .
russia &apos;s putin sacks chief of staff sergei ivanov
russian president vladimir putin has unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff sergei ivanov .
mr ivanov has been part of mr putin &apos;s trusted inner circle for many years .
the 63-year-old has now been made a special representative for environmental and transport issues .
a statement from the kremlin said that mr putin had &quot; decreed to relieve ivanov of his duties as head of the russian presidential administration , &quot; but gave no reason .
mr ivanov &apos;s deputy since 2012 , anton vaino , has been appointed as his successor .
mr vaino , 44 , is a former diplomat .
born in the estonian capital tallinn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious moscow state institute of international relations ( mgimo ) and served in the tokyo embassy .
later he managed presidential protocol and government staff , the kremlin website says ( in russian ) .
on being appointed , he told mr putin : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
i think the administration &apos;s most important task is to support your activity as head of state in terms of drafting laws and control over how your instructions are implemented .
mr putin told a russian tv station on friday that mr ivanov had asked to leave the post , and recommended that mr vaino should replace him .
do the smiles convince ?
this is a move that has mystified moscow .
sergei ivanov has long been one of vladimir putin &apos;s closest allies and , like him , served in the soviet security service , the kgb .
as chief of staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
in a meeting with president putin shown on state television both men claimed that the chief of staff was stepping down at his own request .
but despite the smiles for the cameras , few here are convinced - especially now , just before parliamentary elections .
so is this the fall-out from some kind of power struggle ?
no-one knows yet .
but the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president , suddenly wanted to run russia &apos;s environmental policy - has been met with great scepticism .
in remarks to mr putin , quoted on the kremlin website , mr ivanov said &quot; it &apos;s true that in early 2012 i asked you , in a conversation , to entrust me with this very complicated post , even - you could say - troublesome post , for four years .
well , it turns out that i &apos;ve been presidential chief of staff for four years and eight months .
mr ivanov took up the post in december 2011 .
he served previously as a deputy prime minister and defence minister .
he is a member of the russian security council and a former member of the kgb state security service , like mr putin .
in the late 1990s , when mr putin was head of the federal security service ( fsb ) , which replaced the kgb , mr ivanov was appointed as his deputy .
when mr putin came to power , he named mr ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most .
it was once thought that mr ivanov might become president of russia after mr putin &apos;s second term , as a third term for mr putin would have been unconstitutional .
but that post was taken by another close putin ally , dmitry medvedev .
mr putin became prime minister , before returning to the presidency just three-and-a-half years later .
criminal minds star thomas gibson sacked after hitting producer
gibson was involved in a physical altercation on the set of the show in los angeles last month .
abc studios and cbs television studios , which produce the series , announced his dismissal in a joint statement .
gibson , who played special agent aaron hotchner , issued an apology on thursday before his termination was announced .
there were creative differences on the set and a disagreement .
i regret that it occurred , &quot; he said in a statement .
details on how gibson &apos;s character will be written out of the show , which follows a team of fbi agents , is expected to come at a later date , according to the abc studios and cbs television studios statement .
the 54-year-old , who previously starred on the sitcom dharma &amp; greg , had been on the show since its first season in 2005 .
&quot; i love criminal minds and have put my heart and soul into it for the last twelve years , &quot; gibson said in a statement released on friday .
i had hoped to see it through to the end , but that won &apos;t be possible now .
i would just like to say thank you to the writers , producers , actors , our amazing crew , and , most importantly , the best fans that a show could ever hope to have .
the show is slated to return for its twelfth season on 28 september .
mystery as fish land in banff garden
a banff man has appealed for help in identifying fish that have appeared in his garden in banff .
kevin bain thinks the 75 fish could be sand eels deposited by a waterspout .
mr bain , who lives about 500m from the sea , posted footage of the spectacle on periscope in the hope someone could shed light on the appearance of the two-inch fish .
queensferry crossing : bridge now connected to fife
the £ 1.35bn project is now due to be complete by may 2017
engineers have joined the queensferry crossing &apos;s north deck and viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected to fife .
it is the first of four closures between the &quot; deck fans , &quot; which are now nearing completion around each of the bridge &apos;s three towers .
the bridge section from fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 stay-cables .
the £ 1.35bn project is now due to be complete by may 2017 .
economy secretary keith brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the land on to the bridge .
he said : &quot; this is a historic and symbolic moment in the building of the queensferry crossing .
we &apos;re all witnessing engineering on a truly epic scale on this project , with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel used just to build this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge completing the closure between the viaduct and bridge deck is a delicate operation involving extremely precise tolerances for fit up .
overall , nearly 79 % of the total bridge deck is now in place , the final section of deck is having its concrete deck cast in rosyth today , meaning all the deck is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge .
michael martin , forth crossing bridge constructors project director said : &quot; the first closure on any bridge project is always a significant milestone .
on this fantastic project , this closure represents leading edge civil engineering .
after installing the last road deck section and connecting it to the expanding north tower road deck , we then had to close the remaining gap on the north - or landward - side .
this was done by pulling the northern approach viaduct 700 millimetres southwards .
this was a massive and , at the same time , very delicate operation .
massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long , weighs approximately 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled up a gradient of about 3 % .
delicate because the tolerances the team were working to were tiny - just a few millimetres either way .
happily , it all went very well .
moelfre bay rescue : three men are &apos; lucky to be alive&apos;
three men are &quot; lucky to be alive &quot; after they were thrown from their fishing boat off anglesey .
moelfre rnli lifeboat station raised the alarm at 13 : 20 bst on friday after a crew saw the incident unfold in moelfre bay .
the three men struggled to swim to safety while their boat continued under its own power .
&quot; we saw their boat circling close to them and imagined the worst , &quot; said moelfre lifeboat helm vince jones .
&quot; fortunately , by the time we had launched , the strong winds had blown it clear of them , &quot; he added .
two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat , while the third man , aged 60 , was found exhausted and clinging to a buoy without a lifejacket .
they were all taken on board the inshore lifeboat and brought back to the lifeboat station
mr jones said : &quot; the three men thrown in the water are lucky to be alive and completely uninjured .
the boat &apos;s engine had an emergency kill cord but it had somehow come detached from the person driving the boat when it capsized .
someone was watching over these guys today .
pokémon go a worthy hunt for health and happiness
it is fascinating to see how the world turns .
that teenagers and children do not get outside to play any more , preferring to spend their free time looking at screens , has been the lament of many for the the past decade .
pokemon go is getting people off the couch and into some activity .
screen time was initially limited to the television then video games and more recently smartphones .
so it is great to see that technology and being active outdoors are not mutually exclusive .
i am of course referring to the craze that is pokémon go , an app based on the characters first created for video games in the 1990s ( it later spawned a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin offs ) .
like many pop cultural phenomena it had gone off the boil somewhat before this new game was made available in the us , australia and new zealand in early july .
the launch in other countries was then delayed by the massive response , which overloaded servers .
within days , pokémon go had more users than tinder and nearly as many as twitter .
so how does it work ?
in a nutshell , players on smartphones go out looking for pokémons , which are tracked with a gps and , once found , can be &apos; photographed &apos; ( via a screenshot on your phone ) or &apos; captured &apos; .
a generation who played the game when younger have joined the craze , jumping off the couch for the search .
in the us , the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by the &quot; average &quot; person each day .
cardiogram , an app for the apple watch that tracks 35,000 users , told the washington post recently that within two days of the game launching , the number of people it tracked who did 30 minutes of exercise each day jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent .
the company does not know who is playing pokémon go - it just sees raw data on exercise levels .
many public health campaigns to get people to &quot; find 30 , &quot; &quot; get off the couch &quot; and &quot; be active everyday &quot; have fallen on deaf ears because most public health messages are boring and delivered by people who look miserable .
yet the importance of exercise cannot be understated .
those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of getting cancer or depression .
activity helps with weight management , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits too long to list here .
but the beauty of pokémon go is it gets people outside doing something they enjoy .
thus you are covering three pillars of health - movement , fresh air and sunshine , and fun .
some people are even making new friends on the hunt .
as usual there are po-faced killjoys looking for something to complain about .
and yes somebody might walk into a door .
so what ?
a breakthrough has occurred .
for while smartphone apps like fitbit could previously track our activity , they didn &apos;t give us a reason to exercise like this game does .
the novelty will wear off and use will subside in due course .
however because of pokmeon &apos;s success there will be more games that combine apps and virtual reality with being active in the real world , helping many people on the hunt to be more active , fitter and healthier .

simone biles nails all-around gold in women &apos;s gymnastics
forget the pressure .
forget the hype .
simone biles is immune to all of it .
dynamic on vault .
effortless on beam .
jaw-dropping on floor .
brilliant all over .
and now , finally , an olympic champion .
the 19-year-old american gymnast soared to the all-around title on thursday , putting the gap between herself and the rest of the world on full display under the olympic spotlight .
her total of 62.198 was well clear of silver medalist and &quot; final five &quot; teammate aly raisman and russian bronze medalist aliya mustafina .
united states &apos; simone biles performs on the balance beam during the artistic gymnastics women &apos;s individual all-around final at the 2016 summer olympics in rio de janeiro , brazil , thursday .
biles became the fourth straight american woman to win the all-around title and fifth overall while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever .
she burst into tears when her final total was posted and her long journey to this moment ended .
the achievement puts her in the same league as once-in-a-generation athletes like michael phelps who have taken their sports to new heights :
biles has spent the last three years dominating her sport , winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold - with routines so astonishing in their mix of ambition and precision that 1984 olympic champion mary lou retton called her &quot; the greatest gymnast i &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
one last test awaited in brazil , a contest not so much between biles and the rest of the field but between herself and the burden of oversized expectations .
anything less than heading back to her family &apos;s home in spring , texas , with a fistful of golds would be seen as a disappointment .
united states &apos; simone biles , left , and aly raisman embrace after winning gold and silver respectively for the artistic gymnastics women &apos;s individual all-around final at the 2016 summer olympics in rio de janeiro , brazil , thursday , aug .
biles earned the first one on tuesday while serving as the exclamation point to retiring national team coordinator martha karolyi &apos;s going away party .
while biles insisted she &apos;s never looked ahead during her long run at the top , that &apos;s not exactly true .
a portion of her floor exercise routine - the one that includes her signature tumbling pass - is set to latin music that would fit right at home in the street right outside the rio olympic arena .
it &apos;s not a coincidence .
the girl adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and discovered by coach aimee boorman &apos;s mother during a field trip to the gym where boorman was coaching has become a force .
she hasn &apos;t lost an all-around competition since the summer of 2013 , a winning streak that should go for as long as biles wants it to .
though mustafina took a small lead through two rotations , it was a mirage .
balance beam and floor exercise - where biles is the defending world champion - lay in wait .
she went back in front with a 15.433 on beam - and capped it with a 15.933 on floor .
raisman hugged her gently as they awaited the final score - a mere formality - and tears appeared around biles &apos; glittery red , white and blue eyeliner when the vision she once wrote in a scrapbook became a reality .
raisman &apos;s performance was a bit of revenge from four years ago , when she tied for third but lost the bronze to mustafina on a tiebreaker .
this time , the 22-year-old team captain the americans call &quot; grandma &quot; was well ahead .
she blew kisses to the crowd after her floor exercise , overcome by a comeback that at times seemed in doubt .
as for biles , the 19-year-old &apos;s viral tweet from earlier this week now carries a whole new meaning :
police : 3 victims in serial killer case shot while listening to music in car
two women and a 12-year-old girl who died in the deadliest attack in phoenix &apos;s first serial killer case in a decade were sitting in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot , according to police reports released thursday .
angela rochelle liner , stefanie r. ellis and ellis &apos; daughter maleah were shot on june 12 while the car was parked in a driveway , authorities said .
the gunman fired as many as eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car then fled in another vehicle , the report states .
police say the triple killing doesn &apos;t appear to have been the result of a robbery because the attacker didn &apos;t take purses or $ 2,900 in the possession of one of the adult victims .
phoenix police spokesman sgt. jonathan howard said the shooting prompted investigators to look at whether it was tied to four earlier attacks .
in all , seven people have been killed and two others wounded in nine attacks in two predominantly hispanic neighborhoods over a four-month period .
&quot; it &apos;s occurring within a residential area in front of a home , &quot; howard said to cbs affiliate kpho earlier this month .
the suspect is believed to have used several vehicles , including as a late-1990s brown nissan , a late-1990s black bmw and a white cadillac or lincoln .
investigators have declined to reveal the evidence that led them to conclude the attacks are related and committed by the same killer .
ellis , 33 , was hospitalized for her injuries and later died .
liner , 31 , and ellis &apos; daughter maleah died at the scene .
a witness told police that it wasn &apos;t unusual for them to sit in a parked car listening to music .
authorities also released a police report on a shooting that targeted an unoccupied pickup truck just a half-hour before the triple killing and is believed to have been the work of the serial killer .
investigators found bullet casings and recovered a bullet from a seat and bullet fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of 6-year-old with microcephaly : &quot; it gets better &quot;
like most six-year-olds , edmund picciuto loves singing , toys and , of course , his mother .
but unlike most of his peers , edmund has microcephaly , the result of a genetic disorder his mom elizabeth picciuto didn &apos;t know about while pregnant .
when he first came home my initial thought was , i can &apos;t do this .
i can &apos;t do this .
i didn &apos;t sign up for this .
which is not true at all -- of course you sign up for it , &quot; she said .
she and her husband , vincent , were told edmund might never recognize them , and that he might not even survive .
some doctors went as far as suggesting he be institutionalized .
&quot; my first response was &apos; i didn &apos;t think people did that anymore , &apos; &quot; picciuto explained .
edmund walks with the help of a walker .
edmund didn &apos;t sit up or crawl until he was three , and he still doesn &apos;t talk .
but he &apos;s slowly meeting some milestones .
he &apos;s walking with help , and riding a bike .
he also loves playing with his two brothers , and singing .
elizabeth demonstrates the sign language edmund made up for &quot; please sing to me . &quot;
&quot; we &apos;re teaching him sign language , &quot; picciuto told cbs news .
but it &apos;s not just typical sign language -- she says edmund has invented some of his own signs .
microcephaly can arise from a number of different conditions : genetic ones like edmund &apos;s , and infections during pregnancy from viruses like measles and zika .
symptoms and prognosis can vary widely .
it &apos;s too early to tell how it will affect the lives of those infected with zika .
picciuto remembers the emotional toll of an uncertain future .
i kept saying , what &apos;s going to happen ?
what &apos;s going to happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t really know .
i actually haven &apos;t asked for a prognosis in forever , because i don &apos;t expect anyone to really be able to tell me .
but picciuto has hopeful advice for the mothers of babies with birth defects from zika .
it gets better .
you know it will get better for you .
you will love your child , and your child will love you .
heavy rain , flooding prompts rescues in louisiana , mississippi
heavy rain and widespread flooding in louisiana lead the governor to declare a state of emergency on friday , with more rain expected over the state through saturday .
numerous rivers in southeast louisiana and southern mississippi were overflowing their banks and threatening widespread flooding after extreme rainfall , the national weather service reported .
louisiana gov. john bel edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local officials , and assistance is already on the move to affected parishes .
mike steele , a spokesman for the governor &apos;s office of homeland security and emergency preparedness , said requests were coming in for high-water vehicles , boats and sandbags .
steele said tangipahoa parish alone requested tens of thousands of sandbags .
a flood watch remains in effect until saturday across most of south louisiana .
the weather service said in a statement that an additional 3 to 5 inches could fall over the area .
in south alabama , a flood watch was in effect friday as rain continued in the mobile area .
the comite river near baton rouge and amite river near denham springs , both in louisiana , were predicted to set record crests over the weekend .
forecaster alek krautmann said both rivers could flood many houses in suburban areas near baton rouge .
he also said that flooding downstream in ascension parish is a threat , as those swollen rivers will be slow to drain into lake maurepas .
the tickfaw river , just south of the mississippi state line in liverpool , louisiana , was already at the highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. friday .
rescuers were still plucking people from floodwaters in amite and wilkinson counties in southwest mississippi .
leroy hansford , his wife and stepson were among those rescued earlier friday near gloster .
hansford , 62 , says waters from beaver creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , rose quickly overnight .
he said another stepson who lives nearby alerted him .
&quot; we woke up and the water kept on coming , &quot; hansford said .
it came up to my waist .
his wife told hansford that it &apos;s the highest she &apos;s seen the creek in the 48 years she &apos;s lived there .
hansford said he and his family members all have disabilities , and he &apos;s the only one who can swim .
hansford said emergency workers rescued all three in a large military-style truck and took them to the fire station in gloster , where they were sheltering friday .
krautmann says flooding is &quot; quickly becoming widespread &quot; as heavy rains continue , saying officials are considering evacuation orders .
krautmann says one observer near livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to friday morning .
krautmann said the ground was heavily saturated by rainfall since wednesday .
heavy rain and street flooding prompted the rescue of residents from their homes in tangipahoa parish and the cancellation of classes in five school districts , authorities said .
cbs affiliate wwl reports that an alderwoman in tangipahoa said 200 homes flooded .
residents had been evacuated to two churches but both are now flooding .
parish president robby miller said authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets stranded by high water .
shelters have been opened in the town of amite and the city of hammond to house those who were evacuated .
&quot; they will be allowed to return home once the water starts to recede , &quot; he said .
in the tangipahoa parish city of hammond , close to two dozen streets were closed because of high water , and sandbags were made available for pickup by residents hoping to keep water out of homes and businesses .
&quot; the last major flood we had was in march , &quot; said city administrator lacy landrum .
this one is on track to be a similar event .
in mississippi , harrison county emergency manager rupert lacy said steady rain continued on the gulf coast .
he said a handful of houses were reported as flooded thursday , but none have been reported so far friday .
keith townson , manager of shopper value foods in amite , has lived in the area for 40 years .
&quot; i &apos;ve seen water in some places i have never seen before , &quot; townson said , &quot; and it &apos;s still coming down . &quot;
mahaj brown , 6 , &quot; riddled with bullets , &quot; survives philadelphia shooting
police say a 6-year-old boy has been shot in philadelphia , marking the second shooting of a 6-year-old in the city this week .
the child &apos;s grandparents identified him to cbs philadelphia as mahaj brown .
the grandparents say brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds , including in his groin , leg , arm and abdomen , but was awake when he was transported to the hospital .
&quot; he just took a lot , his little body was riddled with bullets , &quot; his grandmother delores melendez tells the station .
i just can &apos;t believe it .
the boy is listed in critical condition at a hospital and has undergone several surgeries .
family tells the station he is expected to recover .
he was set to start first grade at a local elementary school .
brown was among four people shot in the germantown section .
also shot were three men : two 29-year-olds and one 32-year old .
one of the 29-year-old men was reported in critical condition ; the other two victims were listed in stable condition , according to cbs philadelphia .
the child was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old in critical condition , the station reports .
the other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be a shooter .
investigators tells cbs philadelphia it appears there was crossfire between multiple gunmen .
assault weapon-style shell casings , traced to different assault style weapons , littered the scene .
it appears that this was definitely an ongoing battle .
there were casings in the street , on both sides of the sidewalk .
so it appears that there were multiple armed combatants out here and that they were actively engaged , &quot; philadelphia police captain anthony ginaldi told the station .
multiple houses and vehicles in the area were also struck .
no arrests have been made and police are reportedly reviewing surveillance video .
another 6-year-old , a girl , was hit in her arm by a stray bullet tuesday while playing in front of her home in the west oak lane neighborhood .
she is recovering , and police are still searching for a suspect .
why we need simone , gabby and laurie
that &apos;s what i call this year &apos;s women &apos;s olympic gymnastics team and for more reasons than one .
first , i have been to every summer olympics since 1984 and the usa has never been so dominant .
and second : this team features three gymnasts , simone biles , gabby douglas and lauren &quot; laurie &quot; hernandez , who have been inspiring so many young girls of color .
the make-up of this team , rounded out by aly raisman , who is jewish , and madison kocian , who is catholic , is making everyone proud .
this team looks , finally , like america .
it also has solidified the black and latina female presence at the top of this sport .
for the past four years , the number one female gymnast has been african-american .
last year , simone and gabby were # 1 and # 2 .
this is powerful .
last olympics , gabby douglas was a surprise olympic champion , and america cheered .
now the world has been able to witness the incredible performances of three-time world champion simone biles , douglas and laurie hernandez delivering the unexpected , yet masterful gymnastics routines .
on thursday , simone became the fourth straight american to win gold in the women &apos;s individual all-around event .
and teammate aly raisman earned silver .
we are witnessing the top of the sport , but it does not look like this at gymnastics classes across the country .
simone , gabby and laurie all took the same path as aly and madison to make the olympic team .
they are the &quot; final five &quot; because the next olympic gymnastics team will only have four gymnasts on the team , and this is marta karolyi &apos;s last year coaching .
but the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport , and gymnasts primarily train in private gymnastics clubs that are maintained by parents paying the cost of the training , facility , travel , uniforms , competition fees , hotel fees ( for the coaches and their gymnasts and families ) and the list goes on .
most of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburban neighborhoods that can support the business .
these clubs are where the gymnasts get all of their training , and it &apos;s a costly and long-term commitment for the gymnasts &apos; families .
aimee boorman , coach of simone biles , and maggie haney , coach of laurie hernandez , have both coached their athletes since they started in gymnastics .
we must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to the communities of countless young girls who are inspired by simone , gabby and laurie .
i founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago .
at my organizations , we have provided free and low-cost gymnastics , based in harlem , for over 15,000 urban youth ( primarily black and hispanic ) and have trained national and international champions .
in september , we will be expanding to detroit ( my hometown ) to provide high quality gymnastics to the youth that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great olympic sport .
gymnastics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body and hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination provides life-long benefits for good health , success in school and work .
it is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of young girls to take gymnastics and that is great .
to participate in sport is so important , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank you simone , aly , laurie , gabby and madison for that serious showcase of &quot; girl power &quot; in winning the olympic team gold and for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to begin their path to be healthy , strong and successful young women .
junior doctors set to mount further strikes after rejecting jeremy hunt &apos;s proposal
ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with british medical association officials , but 58 per cent of the 37,000 junior doctors who took part in a ballot had rejected it .
in july , mr hunt revealed plans to impose the contract saying the nhs was in &quot; no man &apos;s land &quot; and any further delay would be damaging for staff and patients .
the first junior doctors are moved onto the new contract , which includes changes to overnight and weekend working practices to improve care at unsociable hours .
dr ellen mccourt , the bma &apos;s junior doctors &quot; committee chair , said in a statement last night : &quot; junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract , particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis , and that it fails to treat all doctors fairly . &quot;
with just eight weeks before the first group of doctors are moved onto the new contract , progress needs to be made and time is running out .
efforts by the bma to resolve the dispute through talks have been met with an unwillingness to engage and , at times , deafening silence from the government .
this is despite a promise from jeremy hunt just last month that his door is always open .
&quot; jeremy hunt needs to act now , lift the imposition and address junior doctors &quot; concerns .
if he does not then junior doctors are clear that they are prepared to take further industrial action .
the last strike at the end of april saw the postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments as nurses and consultants were drafted in to provide cover for doctors on the picket line .
ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with british medical association officials .
the bma wants better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors who would be subject of the contract .
daniel mortimer , chief executive of nhs employers , called on junior doctors not to go ahead with any strikes .
mr mortimer said : &quot; industrial action achieves little or nothing , but places pressure on already stretched teams and services and causes worry , distress and disruption for patients , carers and their families . &quot;
over the last two months we have been talking with the junior doctors committee and have , along with the department of health and others , responded positively to their concerns regarding the guardian role and whistleblowing .
employers were hopeful that the continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as deployment , flexibility in training , additional training for those returning from career breaks , costs of training , mutual recognition of syllabus , study leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers , health education england and the department of health were about honouring the agreements reached with the bma in november , february and may .
the £ 2-a-day drug that can cut heart attack threat
thousands of heart attack patients are to benefit from a £ 2-a-day drug , after officials recommended it be given to more people for longer .
anti-clotting drug ticagrelor slashes the risk of repeat attacks for people with heart disease .
the drug is already given for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of a stroke or another attack .
nhs watchdog nice has advised that it should be given to people for four years , to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
but now nhs watchdog nice has advised that it should be given to people for four years , to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
some 140,000 people have a heart attack in england every year , and a quarter of these go on to have another attack or a stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by the build-up of fatty material in artery walls to form a plaque .
if the plaque breaks apart it can cause a blood clot , blocking blood to the heart causing a heart attack .
and if the clot dislodges it can travel in the blood stream and block blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
people who have already have one attack are at a higher risk of having another .
ticagrelor , which is made by uk firm astrazeneca and sold under the trade name brilique , reduces this risk by making clots less likely .
the draft nice guidance , published today , recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months , followed by 60mg along with aspirin twice a day for another three years .
professor carole longson , director at the nice health technology evaluation centre , said : &quot; despite the availability of effective secondary prevention treatments , as many as a quarter of people who have had a heart attack go on to have another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences . &quot;
fear of a recurrence can have a significant negative impact on a person &apos;s quality of life .
the evidence shows that ticagrelor , in combination with aspirin , is effective at reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack .
in provisionally recommending ticagrelor we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who stand to benefit from it .
because information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - particularly the risk of bleeding - beyond three years is limited , the draft guidance does not recommend treatment with it beyond that period .
pc culture let vote fraud in muslim areas flourish
ex-tower hamlets mayor lutfur rahman was removed from office last year for corruption , prompting the government report
a culture of political correctness has led to a blind eye being turned to widespread voting fraud in muslim communities , a devastating government report reveals today .
ex-cabinet minister sir eric pickles lambasts the police , election watchdogs and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse because of &quot; over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion . &quot;
the former communities secretary , now the anti-corruption tsar , said the intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so bad that police should be allowed to put cordons outside polling stations to protect frightened voters .
he recommends that voters should have to take id to prove who they are when they vote .
currently , a voter merely has to state their name and address .
the report even suggests putting indelible ink on a person &apos;s fingers as they cast their ballot to prevent anyone being able to vote twice .
greater protection should be given to whistleblowers , sir eric says .
he calls for the press to be given greater access to council papers and decisions taken by unofficial committees or working groups .
&quot; this is not solely to protect against electoral fraud , but to protect local government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it , &quot; he said .
the report was ordered by downing street in the wake of the tower hamlets voting scandal in east london .
last year a special election court ruled the sitting mayor , lutfur rahman , should be removed from office following a litany of corrupt and illegal practices .
the court found rahman &quot; cynically perverted &quot; the religious feeling of his muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and islamophobia .
rahman , it was said , &quot; ran his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of faithful muslims to vote for him . &quot;
up to 300 votes were dubious or the result of personation , where a person votes while posing as someone else .
sir eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country .
he voiced particular alarm about postal voting fraud - in which senior members of the muslim community were said to have exerted pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choosing .
sir eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean up the voting system including bringing your id to prove who you are
his report says : &quot; evidence was presented of pressure being put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities , particularly women and young people , to vote according to the will of the elders , especially in communities of pakistani and bangladeshi background .
&quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions had turned a blind eye to such behaviour because of &quot; politically correct &quot; over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion . &quot;
sir eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including banning political activists from handling postal ballot papers to stop &quot; vote harvesting . &quot;
the report , being considered by theresa may , also calls for tougher checks on registration to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and benefit fraud .
consider the options for requiring voters to produce id before voting .
use indelible ink on a person &apos;s fingers once they cast their ballot to prevent anyone voting twice .
carry out systematic checks on a person &apos;s nationality to ensure they are eligible to vote .
put a three-year limit on requests for an automatic postal vote .
ban political campaigners and activists from handling completed postal votes and postal vote envelopes .
give police powers to set up cordons around polling stations .
change the law to make it easier to charge people with intimidation under the representation of the people act 1983 .
make it illegal to take pictures in polling stations .
make it a requirement that only english is to be used in polling stations ( except in wales ) .
strengthen training to ensure staff enforce the rule that voters go to the booth alone .
sir eric savages the metropolitan police , saying it is &quot; astonishing &quot; that no criminal charges were brought after the tower hamlets case .
&quot; the election court disqualified lutfur rahman and his agent for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; he said .
he was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - to a criminal standard of proof - on a series of grounds .
he also criticises the ineffectual &quot; tick-box inspections &quot; of town hall electoral registration departments .
sir eric said : &quot; last year &apos;s court ruling in tower hamlets was a wake-up call .
our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments , yet the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and state of denial by some bodies threatens that good reputation .
crazy for kate &apos;s cyclist lookalike and other celeb doppelgangers of rio olympians
fans of the rio 2016 olympics this week have gone wild for french cyclist pauline ferrand-prevot , who has proven an impressive lookalike for the duchess of cambridge .
but the 24-year-old olympian is far from the only athlete out fighting for gold this summer that boasts their own celebrity doppelganger - at least not according to social media .
so , in honor of the rio games and all the famous faces crossing our screens at the moment , femail have compiled a list of olympians who bear more than a passing resemblance with hollywood celebs .
the hunter and the wolf : u.s. men &apos;s archery team member brady ellison , left , has been compared to leonardo dicaprio since he was a kid
aside from kate &apos;s doppelganger on the cycling track , many people online have been quick to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of a-lister leonardo dicaprio .
u.s. men &apos;s archery team member brady ellison has caused a storm on twitter after images of him looking eerily similar to the wolf of wall street star surfaced .
and in fact , the archer became aware of the social media frenzy and admitted that he has been hearing that he looks like leo since he was a kid .
&apos;i personally don &apos;t see a huge resemblance , maybe besides the facial hair , &apos; brady told huffington post .
&apos;he is a good-looking dude so i guess it &apos;s a compliment . &apos; 
one of the most popular comparisons from london 2012 is undoubtedly going to be pointed out even more this year : the striking likeness between british long jumper greg rutherford and popular actor neil patrick harris .
russian gymnast aliya mustafina , with her large , expressive eyes , has been said to be a dead ringer for cuban-american singer gloria estefan .
and over in the pool , south african swimmer cameron van der burgh has been getting compared to glee star matthew morrison for years now .
changing it up : this user reckons that nathan is an &apos; athletic version &apos; of the inception actor
another long-running comparison has been between tennis star rafael nadal and actor josh hartnett who boast a similar heavy brow and lips .
silver medal swimmer russia &apos;s yulia efimova boasts more than just the same sunkissed skin and blonde hair as actress annalynne mccord , while team usa &apos;s nathan adrian has been said by fans to resemble an &apos; athletic version of joseph gorgon levitt . &apos; 
tough women : soccer star hope solo , left , and dexter actress jennifer carpenter , right , have similar face shapes and eyes
not the only one : one twitter user was very pleased that others also saw the similaritiest
floating a theory : according to this user , perhaps there is a reason behind the pair &apos;s similar looks
one twitter user took to the site recently to declare her happiness that &apos; the rest of the internet thinks that hope solo and jennifer carpenter are actually identical . &apos; 
indeed , the usa soccer star and the dexter actress share incredibly similar face shapes and eyes .
other popular comparisons have included kerri walsh-jennings and her smile that is near-identical to that of actress laura linney , as well as gold medal-winning gymnast gabby douglas , who boasts her own beautifully broad smile that matches that of bring it on star gabrielle union .

too excited , went out like stink , died like a pig .
thanks for that .
chinese swimmer ai yanhan , 14 , swam the second leg of the relay in 1 : 57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than canada &apos;s taylor ruck , allowing the canadians to close the gap on china .
viewers across canada were quick to react online after being shocked by the tone and the language used
emmett macfarlane tweeted , &quot; did the cbc announcer just say the 14-year-old swimmer from china &apos; died like a pig &apos; &quot; ? ? ? ?
the idiot didn &apos;t realize they were still on the air . &apos; 
ai yanhan of china in the women &apos;s 4 x 200m freestyle relay final was described as : &apos; that little 14-year-old from china dropped the ball , baby . &apos; 
criticism on twitter came thick and fast against byron macdonald with many calling him out
twitter users did not hold back when the heard how insensitive byron macdonlad was being

&apos;needless to say , there was no disrespect intended and i &apos;m very sorry . &apos; 
primark shopper outraged at woman who brazenly tried on underwear in the middle of the shop
shoppers didn &apos;t know where to look when a woman stripped off to try on knickers on the shop floor in the middle of a primark .
to make it even worse , she sized up how she looked in them , peeled them off and put them back on the shelf .
she carried on browsing and eventually tried on four pairs of underwear at the store in bouverie place shopping centre , folkestone .
the primark store in bouverie place shopping centre , folkestone , where the woman tried on knickers before putting them back on the shelf
a mother-of-two , jenny davidson , who was in the shop at the time , said after trying on the underwear the mystery woman &apos; got dressed again and walked out of the store without buying anything . &apos; 
she said : &apos; people couldn &apos;t believe what they were seeing . &apos; 
standing in the middle of the shop floor , she took a pair of knickers from the display , stripped off her own tights and pants and put them on .
&apos;she didn &apos;t try to find anywhere discreet to do it - she just stood there , bold as brass . &apos; 
&apos;everyone was staring as she took the knickers off again and obviously didn &apos;t like them because she put them back on the shelf . &apos; 
she did the same with three more pairs before finally deciding there was nothing she liked and she got dressed again and walked out .
&apos;she didn &apos;t seem to care who was watching - or think about the person who would eventually buy the knickers she &apos;d been trying on . &apos; 
ms davidson , 33 , who lives in the kent town , said : &apos; how disgusting to think someone is going to take home knickers that another person has been wearing and they haven &apos;t been cleaned . &apos; 
the incident happened on tuesday afternoon .
ms davidson added : &apos; i gather the staff apparently tried to remove the garments from sale after she had left - which is just as well . &apos; 
&apos;i &apos;d hate to get home with a new pair of knickers and find another woman had put them on and taken them off again , and they hadn &apos;t been washed . &apos; 
a primark spokesman said : &apos; primark is aware of an incident which took place in our folkestone store on tuesday august 9 . &apos; 
all the product in question has been removed from sale .
how to defend yourself from gun attacks using krav maga
it &apos;s a dangerous world out there , but this video from dailymail.com might help make it a little safer for you .
we spoke to rhon mizrachi , new york-based grandmaster of the krav maga federation , to find out how to deal with gun-toting muggers at close range .
whether you &apos;re approached from in front or behind , this video will show you how to turn the tables on your mugger .
if approached from behind , mizrachi says , the first thing to do is turn around , so that you can see your attacker and &apos; clear the line of fire &apos; .
you then grasp the gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting them in the face with your free elbow .
a knee to the groin follows , and while the attacker doubles up in pain , you twist the gun from his hands , smack him in the face with the barrel and back up , keeping the weapon trained on him .
for gunmen approaching from the front , it &apos;s a similar technique - get your body out of the line of fire , grab the gun and twist it around so the villain can &apos;t fire .
at the same time , put weight on the gun and punch the attacker in the chest , then twist the gun from his grip before backing up and pointing it at him .
sounds tricky ?
check the video to see exactly how mizrachi does it .
but remember that the safest way out of any mugging - if you &apos;re not a krav maga grandmaster - is to hand over your cash .
traveller ian wright scrapes his tongue along europe &apos;s dirtiest places for travel guide
a british traveller has put his immune system and gag reflex to a serious test - by licking some of the dirtiest and disgusting places in europe .
presenter and travel writer ian wright , 51 , from suffolk , scraped his tongue along a euro note , a piccadilly circus hand rail , a train toilet &apos;s flush button and a russian public telephone to prove the strength of his immune system .
before licking each object , he used a luminometer to show himself , and us , just what he was getting in to .
but the experiment , which has be made into a film called the lickhiker &apos;s guide to inner strength , threw up some surprising results .
the thought of licking a train &apos;s flush button used by thousands of other may be utterly repellent , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
all the way along his trip through europe , mr wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about boosting gut bacteria and about his own health .
fortunately , nothing he licked left him with anything more than a bad taste in his mouth .
mr wright became known for testing the durability of his gut by travelling around the world and eating weird and wonderful things .
from public handrails in train stations to a toilet flush button the task definitely tested his immune system
in the movie made about it he said : &apos; ever since i was a kid i have been fairly carefree with my health and i &apos;ve put all sorts of things in my mouth from soil , eating worms and muddy water . &apos; 
he certainly proved his reputation during the film .
the only thing he turned down was a filthy russian public toilet .
his sample swab showed a luminometer count of over 4000 units .
by comparison , freshly washed hands should come in under 60 .
but there was one russian public toilet he refused to lick after his luminometer count was over 4000 units , when freshly washed hands are less than 60
mr wright and finnish dairy producer valio have produced the traveller &apos;s film called the lickhiker &apos;s guide to inner strength which shows the bacteria count in different place like in the bathroom
he said in the film : &apos; that is close to one of the worst things i have smelled in a toilet . &apos; 
there &apos;s nothing more dirty than that !
i &apos;m not going to lick anything because it &apos;s disgusting in there .
the lickhiker &apos;s guide to inner strength was produced in conjunction with finnish dairy producer valio .
the company provided mr wright with valio gefilus , which contain lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamins c and d to help boost people &apos;s gut bacteria and immune systems .
valio &apos;s senior vice president of snacks , juice and new categories niko vuorenmaa said : &apos; we really wanted to offer consumers something new .
something that would be fascinating to watch and at the same time explain the benefits of probiotics .
we did a lot of crazy brainstorming that ended in the idea &quot; let &apos;s call ian . &quot;
they claim the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of just talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it &apos;s linked to the immune system .
growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way .
i also think the film shows we have a great sense of humour !
tom hakala , who directed the film , added : &apos; let &apos;s put it this way - i would have lost my respect for ian if he had licked some of the things i asked him to , like the disgusting russian toilet that &apos;s shown in the film . &apos; 
naturally some things were easier to get ian to lick , some were pretty tough .
i &apos;m glad we got some of those dirty licks caught on tape . &apos; 
in a survey conducted in 2015 by valio , 84 per cent of the respondents associated lactic acid bacteria specifically with the well-being of the stomach and gut and 58 per cent said they use at least occasionally products containing added lactic acid bacteria .
family of yobs destroyed saltash , cornwall council house ahead of eviction
a family of yobs left their council house with £ 50,000 worth of damage after they were evicted for terrorising their neighbours .
tanya skeldon and her partner shaun trebilcock have been kicked out of the property in saltash , cornwall , after a long list of complaints against them .
after they were forcibly removed from the property , shocked housing associations officers found the property in a state of disrepair .
the walls were left with gaping holes , floorboards were ripped up , rubbish was strewn over the floor and graffiti was daubed on the walls .
the family have now been moved on and are believed to be living in a private accomodation
donna mcevoy , housing manager at cornwall housing , said she feared it might be beyond saving .
she said : &apos; it &apos;s been an absolute nightmare for people down here and i don &apos;t think people should have to live like that .
there are a lot of things to weigh up because this property will probably be known by the not-so-nice element of cornwall .
this family are notorious and their name is notorious .
the couple had three sons who lived at the property intermittently and police say the reign of terror the family inflicted included fighting in the street with baseball bats , intimidating nearby residents , drug use , drug dealing and excessive shouting , arguing and swearing .
skeldon , 47 , whose name was on the tenancy , was given an antisocial behaviour order in june .
old rubbish was found in a number of the rooms of the house , which may be demolished
floor boards had been pulled up in the property , from which drugs had been dealt in the past
neighbours say they were seen fighting in the street and police were regularly called
cornwall housing evicted her and her partner forcefully from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move on voluntarily .
the eviction was hailed by relieved neighbours who said their lives had been made a living hell .
one said : &apos; they didn &apos;t care about anybody . &apos; 
we lived next to them for 20 years and it &apos;s always been bad .
the amount of times we &apos;ve seen the police down here is unbelievable .
&apos;this morning , we couldn &apos;t sleep . &apos; 
we got up because it was so quiet here - we &apos;re not used to that !
it &apos;s going to be lovely now that they &apos;re finally gone .
adam fitzpatrick , cornwall housing &apos;s neighbourhood enforcement manager , said the family failed to cooperate with the local authority .
the family have lived in the house for 20 years , with police regularly called to the property
rubbish and old toys have been thrown down the overgrown side of the council house
he added : &apos; it is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for the behaviour of her and her family as eviction is always the last course of action that cornwall housing considers .
this was a very difficult case as the behaviour was extreme and their actions must have been terrifying for her neighbours to witness .
i appreciate all the work that has been put in by my team , devon and cornwall police and members of the community who bravely came forward to give us information .
i hope that this development will give some comfort to the neighbours and sends out a message that antisocial behaviour will not be tolerated .
mr fitzpatrick said that the three sons had all lived at the property at different times but said they were all in their 20s .
a dirty mattress left on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after the eviction
housing workers will now have to clear away the piles of rubbish which surround the house
in 2014 , police raided the property and found more than 70g in cannabis as well as scales , paraphernalia and £ 1,700 in cash .
skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of a class b drug with intent to supply .
she claimed the money was going towards a headstone for her son , lee skeldon , who died in a car crash in 2013 .
after being made homeless , it is understood that tanya and her partner are now living in private housing in plymouth .
the walls of many of the house &apos;s rooms had graffiti scrawled across them .
police say they will seek to evict tenants who flout the rules of their tenancies
angela crow , of devon and cornwall police , said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to flout the rules .
&apos;this sends out to those who feel that they can behave without recrimination , as well as those blighted by such behaviour , &apos; she said .
criminal and antisocial behaviour will never be tolerated by devon and cornwall police , who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in portugal are left terrified as a low-flying military jet flies skims beach
tourists sun worshipping in aveiro , portugal , had the shock of their lives
a portuguese air force p-3c orion plane swooped in incredibly low
the air force said it was on a training flight but insisted no risk to safety
this is the moment terrified tourists start to panic as a low-flying jet swooped down over a packed beach .
dramatic footage showed the military plane almost coming within touching distance of sunseekers on the stretch of sand in aveiro , northern portugal .
holidaymakers rose to their feet as they became understandably concerned about the noise from the jet engines without being able to see at first what was coming their way through the clouds .
the incident happened in costa nova near aveiro yesterday afternoon .
daniel fernandes , one of several holidaymakers who posted videos of the dramatic fly-by onto social media , said : &apos; it passed really low twice and there was a point when it looked like it was going to crash . &apos; 
nuno arroja added : &apos; i was surfing and swear it felt like the plane was going to fall on top of me . &apos; 
tourists on the beach at aveiro were terrified when the plane appeared out of the murk and flew at an incredibly low altitude
the portuguese air force said today the pilot of the p-3c orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to drop so low because it was the only way of checking them .
he said the jet had flown slightly lower than normal because of poor visibility caused by the smoke from nearby wildfires , but the air force insisted no-one &apos;s safety had been compromised .
wildfires have devastated parts of mainland portugal this summer as well as killing four people on the island of madeira .
the portuguese air force said today the pilot had to fly low because of the conditions - thick fog and smoke from wildfires - which obscured his visibility
the plane was on a training flight and the pilot was being asked to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
eksote ’ s result during the first half of the year better than expected
the south karelia social and health care district ( eksote ) made a result that was 3,4 million euros better than planned between january and june .
eksote ’ s result showed a surplus of 4,3 million euros during the first half of the year .
the result was especially good in the family and social welfare services , where , by developing preventive services , it has been possible to clear institutional care .
the statutory care guarantee was fulfilled in all operations .
this year eksote ’ s goal is to make the operation queues shorter .
eksote uses the surplus to cover deficit from earlier .
the part left over from that is possibly used to shorten the queues and to buy operations for patients .
the result for the whole year is expected to be 4,6 million euros better than planned .
eksote ’ s board discusses the half-year review in its meeting next wednesday .

an iota ahead of the criminal - criminal intelligence aids in solving crimes and reveals serious criminality - ess.fi
in every 11 police departments in finland , there has been a rta unit ( criminal intelligence and analysis unit ) in operation since the beginning of 2014 .
the operation of the unit is invisible to the outside .
in häme police department , the unit consists of a total of four policemen in lahti and hämeenlinna .
it is managed by a senior sergeant located in lahti .
the head of the commanding officers is an inspector in lahti .
in addition , the unit has a civilian specialising in information technology working in hämeenlinna .
all of the unit work in plain-clothes .
the unit has proved its usability and necessity , considers deputy police chief tero seppänen .
the rta unit produces different kinds of reports for the rest of the police .
in häme it has , among other things , gathered information about asylum seekers .
the most recent method reform
establishing the analysis units has been the most recent reform of the police methods .
the goal has been crime prevention , so that police would less often leave , siren blaring , for the crime scene after it has been alerted .
the data gathered and analysed by the unit helps to focus the daily police activities to where they are needed the most .
with the reformation of the national police board , one criminal intelligence centre was founded in the country , and under it three national units with an own crime intelligence unit in each police department .
the pcb centre in vantaa operates in contact with the national bureau of investigation and manages the operations on a national level .
as the name suggests , there are people from the police , the customs and the border guard working in the pcb units .
as for rta units , they work on areas divided according to police departments , and their duty is to offer data both to local police forces and national units .
intelligence extends outside the own area
where a single police officer knows , what has happened during their 12-hour work shift , the task of an rta unit is to know , what is going on in the whole are of a police department .
intelligence also extends outside the own department ’ s borders , since so does the crime .
those working in an rta unit have better it skills than a rank and file police officer .
the unit aims to call the police &apos;s attention to new phenomena , productive criminals or crimes resembling each other by using registers , alarm assignment database , and observations .
this is called serialisation , and it is one of the most important tools in criminal intelligence .
all people have their own way of operating .
the hand of a person can be seen also in their work , be it honest or criminal .
based on the technique , a certain image is formed of the person .
serialisation can be performed either based on the technique or on the person , depending on which the police have more information on .
criminals learn from their mistakes
the employees in an rta unit do not walk around with their collars turned up , but their work is not completely public , either .
they do not tell about the methods used by them or by the criminals , because this could result in the professional criminals developing their operations and thus seeking to foil the police ’ s crime prevention attempts .
the police will publicly share the methods , if they anticipate a threat from them .
one such case was the way of marking empty apartments that was used in break-ins and was reported in the beginning of the summer .
in this method , the criminals marked the front door with a stick , a pin or a piece of tape to test , whether the occupants were really away .
pre-trial investigation material is public at least for the parties involved .
the analysis unit has observed that the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes .
the most clever ones order the district court official record that can for example reveal that there were fingerprints found from the scene .
the next time , the thieves will use gloves .
deputy police chief tero seppänen from häme police department , inspector tuomo lepola from eastern finland police department , detective inspector sami joutjärvi from joensuu police station , and detective superintendent arto tuomela from national bureau of investigation were interviewed for this story .
the police gathers and analyses date that is used in planning the practical operations .
on the background is the reduction of workforce and funding .
the first steps toward new workings were taken already 30 years ago .
the latest change was a three-stage pora reform that finished by the end of year 2013 .
information beyond the borders of one &apos;s own department and of finland is gathered with national cooperation .
london schoolgirl who joined isil killed in syria
kadiza sultana , one of three british schoolgirls who left london last year to join isil , has reportedly died in syria .
attorney tasnime akunjee said her family learned of her death in raqqa , syria , a few weeks ago .
she was believed to have been killed by a russian air strike in raqqa , the group &apos;s stronghold in the country , itv news reported on thursday .
sultana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died just as she was making plans to flee the war-torn country and return to britain .
&quot; one would hope that the only benefit out of this is - as a tombstone and testament to others , that these are the risks actually involved in going to a war zone - to dissuade people from ever making that choice really , &quot; akunjee said .
in february 2015 , sultana and two other schoolgirls from east london boarded a flight to turkey and then a bus to the syrian border .
sultana &apos;s family was told she married an isil fighter in syria - and became a widow within months .
reid says clinton will stick with garland as supreme court nominee if elected
senate democratic leader harry reid says he is convinced that democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton will nominate judge merrick garland to the supreme court if she is elected president .
senate republicans have blocked garland &apos;s confirmation since president barack obama nominated him in march .
senate majority leader mitch mcconnell says the next president will choose the person to replace late supreme court justice antonin scalia .
reid said on a conference call thursday that he is predicting clinton will pick garland &quot; with some degree of credibility . &quot;
a spokeswoman for reid later said he had not spoken to clinton directly about whether she would nominate garland and was speculating .
he praised garland and said clinton &apos;s team would not want to &quot; rock the boat &quot; with a new pick .
garland is the chief judge for the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit .
reid said republicans who are blocking garland &apos;s nomination are &quot; minions &quot; and &quot; enablers &quot; of republican presidential candidate donald trump .
he said trump is unfit for office .
treats says nude calendar for &apos; women , as well as men&apos;
treats magazine is partnering with photographer david bellemere to launch a 1970s &apos; pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they &apos;re setting out to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 nu muses calendar .
treats president steve shaw told us earlier this year that his nude-heavy magazine differs from old-school playboys because &quot; playboy is for men . &quot;
i do this for women .
apparently he thinks the calendar is , too .
&quot; we need to get back to showcasing timeless and classic nudity where women , as well as men , feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body , &quot; shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar .
women will want to be a part of this project because it &apos;s a beautiful piece of art .
models can submit pics online or in person at open casting calls in los angeles and new york .
vinyl destination : who is actually buying records ?
lonely , middle-aged men love vinyl .
before you rush to litter the comments section with gnarly insults under the pseudonym notalllonelymiddleagedmen , this statement derives from actual data .
according to yougov , the much talked-about record resurgence is driven not by a boom in millennials who want to embrace the novelty of a physical item , but by midlife nostalgia .
those who have recently purchased a vinyl album are most likely to be aged between 45 and 54 , apparently .
in fact , those in the 18-24 age group are the least likely .
it is not just an act of hoarding by hobbyists , either - it has emotional significance : older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings to themselves ( 56 % versus 53 % ) and enjoy being alone ( 69 % versus 66 % ) .
but are yougov &apos;s results true ?
if this blog was a televised news report , the camera would follow me as i walked down the middle of a busy soho street , wearing a modest grey suit and gesturing wildly before stopping , cupping my hands and saying something authoritative like : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a look . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look .
while the heart of soho is slowly being drained of its charm and grot - hotels , eats , prets and paperchases now fill the buildings once occupied by independent sellers - a handful of fantastic specialist record shops still remain .
i &apos;d probably ask the camera to stop rolling for the next bit , in which i stand very close to various men in some of these stores and attempt to gauge their age and emotional disposition via observation .
glaswegian stuart , 55 , whom i follow from sister ray ( data count : two young women , three middle-aged men ) into reckless records ( data count : eight middle-aged men , one woman , probably in her 20s ) is in london for the afternoon for a meeting and is perusing the shops to fill a few hours .
is he a collector , i ask ?
&quot; i suppose i am , &quot; he says .
i have about 3,000 or 4,000 records .
these records , pictured above ( he emailed me the snap , i didn &apos;t follow him home ) , line his living room walls .
his reason for acquiring such a vast number of albums and singles is partly a result of his disposable income : he is now able to buy records he couldn &apos;t afford when they originally came out , and to repurchase items he sold when he was young and skint .
&quot; a lot of the stuff i get is late 60s , early 70s , things that came out when i was 11 or 12 , things i was probably a bit too young to get , &quot; he says .
he agrees that those who purchase records are more likely to be introverts who like their own company , adding : &quot; i don &apos;t smoke , i don &apos;t drink very much .
it &apos;s my vice .
wez , 25 , who works at sister ray , also believes that many of the customers he encounters fit the yougov profile .
he has , however , noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media hype , people who heard about the comeback and felt compelled to buy back their old records .
from conversations i &apos;ve had , people have got rid of their collection , normally around 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their vinyl to buy cds are now selling their cds to buy their records back , &quot; he says .
that may explain a boom in vinyl revivalists of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional importance of records ?
it takes a few seconds in a shop such as phonica to realise that record stores offer a comforting community of likeminded types .
according to wez , some older customers have taken umbrage with the contactless payment system in particular .
some vinyl fans may feel overwhelmed by the digital world and choose to retreat to the stability of the familiar record sleeve , of items that recall halcyon teenage memories .
&quot; i think sometimes it can be filling a void or having material possessions as some kind of comfort , &quot; wez says .
as a collector myself , i have that , and i think a lot of people do .
it &apos;s an easy way to occupy your headspace .
&quot; we &apos;re like their social workers ! &quot; pipes up a co-worker from a stack of records .
an icm poll in april revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a vinyl album the previous month had yet to listen to it .
the poll also found that 41 % have a turntable they never use , while 7 % of those who purchase vinyl don &apos;t own a record player .
at this stage of the news report , i would probably be looking gravely concerned while flicking through a stack of bossa nova compilations .
the &quot; trophy &quot; aspect of the revival is something that jonny , 42 , who works in sounds of the universe ( data count : three midde-aged men ) has noticed .
&quot; someone came in recently and said : &quot; i don &apos;t have a record player , but i want to buy a radiohead record so we can put it on our shelf , &quot; &quot; he says .
that &apos;s not a large percentage , but it &apos;s definitely happening .
more of the product side , less of the music .
we have people saying : &quot; i don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
that &apos;s younger people , not older ones , late teens who are just getting into it .
fopp , which now dedicates almost an entire floor to vinyl , has a far more varied audience when i arrive .
there are couples in their 70s , tourists taking photos , teenage boys and middle-aged women .
while the atmosphere is less at ease than the aforementioned stores - wild beast &apos;s latest synth- and sex-fuelled pop , rather than noodling jazz , is blasting from the speakers - it is good to see diversity in its customers .
none of them look particularly lonely , but nagging psychological trauma is hard to ascertain by standing next to someone for 30 seconds .
elanora , 27 , has been walking around fopp for a few minutes , looking at the variety of records on sale .
she is window-shopping , rather than on a spending spree .
she doesn &apos;t earn a lot , she says , so collecting records isn &apos;t really an option .
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music by a computer or another way , but the beauty of vinyl is ... &quot; she drifts off into a lovestruck sigh .
i don &apos;t know how to explain - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a shop said to have inspired a fresh generation of vinyl lovers : urban outfitters .
while giving the illusion of perusing the denim hot pants , i observe a group of teenage girls , who cluster around the polaroid cameras momentarily , before a dad and his daughter deliberate purchasing a crosley record player .
to the left is a stairwell , a wall of which is stacked with records by adele , jeff buckley , amy winehouse and fleetwood mac : a mix of contemporary and classics , the essential records for any average collection .
nobody is looking - perhaps because they are merely decoration , some so high up the wall that it would be impossible to touch them .
it is pure &quot; art vinyl . &quot;
but , given that any attraction to these items could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers into the depths of soho for more , there is little to complain about .
it is no surprise that a demographic more likely than most to have more time and money than most is also the one that spends the most on luxury items such as vinyl .
but while my findings suggest yougov &apos;s results are accurate , in soho record stores at least , they do not discount the huge number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in reality , in record shops and on online forums .
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
they are certainly not spending their thursday mornings loitering around the record shops of berwick street , flicking through records and avoiding the gaze of a creepy , 30-year-old fake television presenter who is looming over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men .
greenland shark is longest-living vertebrate animal - video report

french court rejects bid to demolish shops at jungle refugee camp
a french court has rejected a bid by calais authorities to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the jungle camp where thousands of refugees are living .
at a court hearing this week , calais authorities had argued the state should be able to knock down a total of 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell goods , from cigarettes to energy drinks , offer haircuts , or sell tea for 50 cents ( 40p ) or basic meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants .
the calais prefect &apos;s office argued the places should be demolished because they represented a parallel economy that did not pay tax , and because they carried fire and sanitation risks .
humanitarian groups had told the court the shops and restaurants were vital , saying the free meals offered by a state-backed association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing numbers at the camp .
they argued the makeshift shops and restaurants often provided shelter and free meals to those in need .
a lille court ruled there was no legal basis for expelling the people running the 72 makeshift shops , but said the calais prefect &apos;s concerns &quot; were totally understandable . &quot;
the judge , jean-françois molla , said the groceries , cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than simply feeding people that &quot; live in extremely precarious conditions . &quot;
he said the spaces provided calm meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that had been under threat from demolition was the camp &apos;s jungle book kids &quot; cafe which is run not-for-profit and provides 200 meals a day , english and french classes , and asylum advice for the hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp .
more than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the kids &quot; cafe .
a letter sent to the guardian said its closure &quot; would be a catastrophe for these children , some of whom are as young as eight . &quot;
two charities , help refugees and l &apos;auberge des migrants , on friday estimated that numbers in the jungle camp have risen to over 9,000 people - the highest ever - after a steep increase in arrivals during the summer .
the price of the food in finland drops clearly faster than the eu average
food becomes strikingly cheaper in finland - a source of joy for consumers and of annoyance to producers .
the price of food in finland has dropped nearly 5 per cent in three years , when the average price drop in eu countries was 0.9 per cent .
at the same time food in germany and sweden is one per cent more expensive .
during the last three years , the price of food in finland has dropped the second most in those eu countries that have the same wage level than finland .
from the analogue countries ’ only britain ’ s food prices have gone down faster than in finland .
this data was shown in an article by senior adviser ilkka lehtinen from statistics finland that was published in tieto &amp; trendit ( data &amp; trends ) blog .
lehtinen compared real prices , prices that are in proportion to the general development of the consumer prices .
the latest data is from june this year .
in the beginning of the 2010s , the price of the food rose sharply .
in 2013 , the prices rose close to the price level of 1994 .
the situation was alarming .
“ we were close to losing that price advantage we got from eu membership ” , lehtinen says .
then a change followed , after which food has become cheaper year by year .
now the price is weighed down by the food import prohibitions set by russia that brought food import from finland to russia to a standstill .
that is why the supply of dairy and meat products has increased in the finnish market , and the producer prices have dropped .
“ putin ’ s policies have helped the finnish consumer in the short term ” , says lehtinen .
also the competition between industry and trade has stepped up and affected the price drop .
the large chains , s group and kesko , have both reduced their prices .
for the consumer the price competition has appeared as impressive advertising campaigns .
finland still is no seat of affordable nourishment , even though the price of the food has dropped significantly .
in 2015 , the food prices in finland were the fourth most expensive from those eu countries that have the same kind of wage level than finland .
according to lehtinen , the food prices in finland are considerably affected by the value-added tax .
he discovered that if the control countries would have the same percentage of value-added tax , finland would have the third cheapest food from the countries that have the same wage level .
lehtinen compared finland with denmark , sweden , austria , france , italy , britain , germany , and the netherlands .
if the value-added tax in the control countries would be seven , only the germans and the dutch would sell cheaper food than the finns .
“ if we want to get to the same food price level with the old eu countries , we have to halve the value-added tax to the average eu country level , and to continue price competition ” , lehtinen writes .
lehtinen points out that the calculations he did with the value-added tax percentage are approximate .
the school is not quite what it used to be
those returning to school may notice that there has been a change in school during the summer .
a new teaching curriculum has been created for schools , and it will be implemented in the beginning of the semester in all primary schools .
they are the guidelines that govern all finnish schools .
the schools decide on the details themselves , but the curriculum states the official goals .
these guidelines have been prepared for several years , and they differ from the old ones in many ways .
for example cursive handwriting will not be taught anymore , and instead coding will be practised at schools .
instruction in swedish will begin on the sixth grade the latest , and social studies will begin already on the fourth grade .
the biggest change , however , concerns the role of the pupils .
before it was thought that a teacher teaches the pupils , but now everyone has to be active and learn from one another .
this is an attempt to make education more interesting .
the longest lived vertebrate in the world was found - the greenland shark can live up to 400 years
the greenland shark ( somniosus microcephalus ) , also known as the grey shark , does not reach its sexual maturity until it is 150 years old .
it can live 250 years after that , a new study reported .
these numbers make this species to be the longest lived vertebrate in the modern world .
in the animal kingdom there is only one who passes it : the oldest ocean quahog known has been estimated to be 507 years old .
greenland sharks swim around the north atlantic .
they also hold another record : they are also the biggest fish in the arctic area .
the females are taller than the males , as they can grow to be over five metres tall .
since the rate of growth is slow , only about a centimetre a year according to monitoring , the adult specimens must have lived a long life .
but how long ?
julius nielsen from the university of copenhagen together with his colleagues found out .
he determined the ages of 28 adult female greenland sharks that had been trapped in fishermen &apos;s nets .
the age of the fish was revealed in radiocarbon dating their eye lenses .
the average age of the studied sharks was revealed to be at least 272 years .
the two largest fish in the sample , the amazon-sized fish of 493 and 502 centimetres long , were revealed to 335 and 392 years old respectively .
since the other studies have found out that the greenland shark females do not reach maturity until they are over 4 metres long , the researchers calculated they are about 150 years old at that stage .
the study was published by science .
stockmann axes up roughly 300 employees - the number of sales assistants stays the same
nearly 300 employees are laid off from the department store company stockmann .
the consultative negotiations in the company that has gotten into difficulties finished in the beginning of august .
“ as a result of the negotiations , approximately 300 jobs will be cut , main part of the cuts will be carried out as lay-offs ” , stockmann says in its press release .
it is also said in the press release that the number of department store sales assistants will not be reduced to ensure excellent customer service .
stockmann will also offer around 80 members of its support staff new positions as sales assistants .
stockmann ’ s negotiations concerned about 3000 employees .
when they began , the need for cuts was estimated to be about 380 employees .
the cuts are expected to generate annual cost savings of roughly 20 million euros that are supposed to realise during next year .
already earlier stockmann has begun an efficiency programme , with which they attempt to create savings of 50 million euros this year .
on the background are stockmann ’ s difficulties to make department store sales profitable .
even though the group ’ s adjusted operating result improved to 11.1 million euros in the second quarter of the year , the department store sales are still unprofitable .
lauri veijalainen , the caretaker chief executive of stockmann says that the sales performance of the department stores has continued to fall short of expectations .
“ personnel reductions are unfortunately a necessary step to ensure that stockmann ’ s retail division achieves a positive result in 2018 ” , veijalainen says in the press release .
the improved second-quarter result is particularly a consequence of the solid performance of fashion chain lindex .
the chain reported the best second-quarter turnover and result in its history .
lindex ’ s profit increased 9.5 million euros to 28.1 million euros .
at the same time last year , the operating result of the whole stockmann group had a loss of 4.1 million .
stockmann estimates that the group &apos;s turnover this year will be smaller than last year .
the adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year .
on friday , the north will be most rainy - temperatures under 20 degrees in the whole country
the low-pressure area on top of northern finland will keep the weather rainy on friday , says hs meteorologist ilona lång .
there will be rain showers also in the central parts of the country , but the weather will be fair farther south .
the temperatures are not very summery anymore , because the mercury will stay below 20 degrees in the whole country .
the rainy areas in the north will remain in 10-15 degrees .
kenya &apos;s athletics team is shaken by a doping scandal - an odd explanation to a coach ’ s move
a kenyan athletics coach , john anzrah , has been sent home from rio olympics after he was found to have been posing as a national team athlete in doping tests .
the news agency ap said that the athlete anzrah was presenting himself as was the 800m star ferguson rotich .
stephen arap soi , who is part of kenya ’ s national team management , said that anzrah &apos;s identity was revealed after he had given a sample as rotich in a surprise test .
the doping officials reported anzrah to the authorities .
according to soi , anzrah was sent home because he “ committed his crime against team kenya ” .
“ he presented himself as an athlete , gave the urine sample and even signed the documents .
we cannot tolerate such behaviour , &quot; growled kip keino , chairman of the national olympic committee of kenya to the news agency reuters .
the olympic athletics begins on friday , and rotich is to run already on that day .
there is no information yet about whether the runner faces some consequences about the incident .
last year at the world championship rotich was fourth on this distance , and is one of the favourites to win in rio .
according to reuters , a source from inside the kenyan athletics team claimed that anzrah only used the athlete ’ s accreditation card to get free breakfasts in the athlete ’ s village .
when he met the anti-doping officials , they expected him to be an athlete , and he was taken to a test .
the coach did not explain the situation to the officials , because he was afraid of being exposed .
where is everyone ?
the athletics stadium in rio is empty
indeed , where is everyone ?
they are certainly not at the rio olympic stadium watching athletics .
the battle for athletics medals in rio began on friday , but the world ’ s top individuals got to showcase their talents to confusingly empty stands .
the organisers of rio told on friday that only 58 per cent of the first day &apos;s morning competition tickets and 65 per cent of the evening competition tickets have been sold .
the situation was different four years ago in london , where the stadium was bursting with cheering people .
the finals ticket are sold out already also at rio .
the spectator loss at rio olympics has attracted attention already before athletics .
there have been thousands of empty seats for example in rugby , canoeing , and riding stands .
when the brazilian medal hopefuls talita antunes and larissa franca played beach volley at legendary copacabana , only 70 per cent of the stands were full .
after the brazilian duo , the netherlands played against russia , and only about 30 per cent of the stands that seat 12.000 people were full .
the bad sales are partly explained by the fact that brazil with its economic difficulties is far away for the european and asian olympic tourists , and many of the olympic sports are strange to brazilians , who are accustomed to football .
however , not even the first match of the brazilian football team managed to fill the football stadium .
the spokesman for the game organisers , mario andrada , said this weekend that at that time , 82 per cent of the tickets had been sold , a number that is clearly smaller than four years ago .
“ there are still 1.1 million tickets left to be sold ” , andrada said according to reuters .
from the 8.5 million tickets in the london olympics 8.2 million were sold , even though they were almost half more expensive than in rio .
in rio , the ticket prices have varied from about nine euros to over a thousand euros for the opening .
over half of the tickets cost under 16 euros .
in london olympics , the voluntary workers and army personnel were allowed to sit on the empty seats , but in rio this has not been allowed yet , as the organisers need money and attempt to sell the tickets until the very last moment .
however , in rio , the organisers have given school children 240.000 tickets for those sports that are less known in the country , like gold and rugby .
there were plenty of empty seats in the rio stadium in the morning .
even beach volley at the sands of copacabana did not interest the audience .
jukka keskisalo competed in london in 2012 .
there were plenty of people at the stands , then .
a new way to protect the nature - buy a right to a piece of land
helsinki foundation has new ways to take part in nature conservation .
the foundation , established last year , acquires ecologically significant areas of land .
after that , private people , companies , and communities can purchase guardianship rights to a block of land .
the foundation ’ s first land property is located in lapland .
the land property is virtually subdivided into small greenspaces , and those who want , can buy a guardianship right to a greenspace .
the guardian has veto rights to their space of 187 square metres , which in practise means that if the large land block ’ s purpose is to be changed , a permission from each guardian is required .
it is possible also to buy guardianships for several greenspaces .
buying a guardianship is something tangible you can pass down or give as a gift .
“ there is no need to carry banners or to chain yourself to something in order to protect the nature ” , explains juha leviäkangas , who acquired a guardianship for his company .
those who acquire a guardianship get the exact co-ordinates of their greenspace , which makes it possible for example to visit the area .
on the foundation ’ s website one can see the name information of the guardians on the same map , where the greenspace information is .
leviäkangas thinks the only risk in his nature conservation purchase is if the foundation ’ s operations change from its original idea .
the helsinki foundation is a non-profit foundation established for the purpose of promoting the conservation of environment and nature .
the risk is for the foundation to act in unethically or commercially , but it should not be possible .
the basic idea of the helsinki foundation ’ s haltija project is to protect nature areas in a way they can stay unspoiled and at peace .
the foundation acquires land blocks either by buying or as a donation .
it finances its operation mainly by selling guardianships , but the foundation received its initial capital from its founders .
the purpose of the foundation is to acquire more protected lands .
it also has plans to go outside finnish borders and to buy some land in australia .
the helsinki foundation showcases its operations in a pop up forest at helsinki market square from august 13 to 19 .
in big cities , bicycle thieves torment turku the most - check the situation in your home town
from finland ’ s big cities , turku is the worst tormented .
this year there have been more stolen bicycles per capita than any of the other nine big cities .
based on the bike thefts reported to the police , helsingin sanomat describes how many bicycles and their parts have been stolen in the ten largest cities between january and august this year per capita .
in addition to turku , helsinki , oulu and lahti were at the top of the list .
according to the police information , there were four to five bike thefts per a thousand residents .
instead in espoo and kouvola , there were only about two reported bicycle thefts per a thousand residents .
that is a big difference .
“ some cities have double the amount of thefts per capita compared to others ” , describes chief superintendent of the national police board , tommi reen .
turku police contemplate , why the city holds the top place in the comparison .
it is extremely difficult to say , why there have been more bicycle thefts in turku than elsewhere .
i have no answer for that .
“ one factor for the frequency of thefts can be how much bike traffic there is in a city , and how many bikes there are in general ” , considers senior sergeant teemu Äikäs .
tommi reen from the national police board says it could be well expected to see turku , helsinki , and oulu to rise to the top in the comparison .
the number of bicycle thefts largely follow those cities , where people study and where they cycle .
turku has a compact centre , short distances , and plenty of bikes available for the thieves .
“ for example espoo is a completely different city , where city centres are far from each other , and bicycle is not necessarily the primary mode of transport ” , reen says .
in the whole of finland between january and august , there have been slightly less bike thefts reported to the police than during the corresponding period last year .
there is still no great reason for joy .
despite the downward trend in recent years , there are still a bit over 20,000 bike thefts reported to the police annually .
that means 50-60 bikes every day , and just in helsinki , about 4000 bikes per year .
“ these numbers are big ” , reen says .
in truth , the thieves take even more bikes , because only a part of the victims report a theft to the police .
reen encourages people to report bike thefts , even if less than one in every ten reported cases are solved .
a typical solved bike theft is a case , where the police is immediately notified of the theft , and the thief is caught right away .
“ cases are solved also in connection to other investigation , like for example when in a drug case there can be stolen bicycles found in an apartment ” , reen tells .
in helsinki , bike thieves are caught every week either red-handed or during a police investigation , says senior constable timo leppämäki .
according to him , bicycles are stolen for example from a shopping centre bicycle stands , from courtyards , storerooms and bicycle basements , so practically from everywhere people usually store them .
as to the individual bike models , the most stolen is jopo , just like in previous years .
a u-lock gives a bicycle better protection than many other locks .
some thieves take a bicycle for example for their own , brief use , but most of the stolen bicycles end up for sale for example online .
the stay in the home market .
“ at least it hasn ’ t come to the police &apos;s knowledge that stolen bicycles hardly go abroad ” , reen says .
buyers of stolen bikes are normal finnish people , according to the police .
some probably buy a stolen bike without knowing .
some may have doubts about it .
a used bike buyer must be cautious , because they could commit a concealment offence or a criminal concealment .
“ the alarm bells should be ringing , if a bicycle in good condition is being sold dirt cheap ” , reen says .
special library assistant severi hirvi always carries his colourful nopsa to a shelter provided by library of kallio in helsinki for the duration of his working day .
he has had five bikes , but none have been stolen , says hirvi . “ never have been taken , so in that sense i &apos;ve been really lucky . ”
“ maybe this isn ’ t so tempting for the thieves , this doesn ’ t necessarily even have any hipster value ” , contemplates hirvi , who lives in helsinki .
siiri valve , who briefly did business in a kiosk in kallio , helsinki , locked her bicycle with a small u-lock .
now bike was just leaning towards the kiosk wall , but usually valve locks her bicycle to something solid , like a bicycle stand .
“ i think about this a lot , because this bike is the most expensive thing i own ” , says the helsinki student about her white bicycle , the frame of which alone cost about 500 euros .
“ i keep hearing from my friends that bikes have been taken . ”
“ mostly bad bikes , these rickety jopos . ”
a bike was stolen from valve herself from a house courtyard a year ago .
the bike was unintendedly left unlocked , so valve knew to anticipate its theft .
those under 15 to account for their crimes ?
helsinki will experiment peer juries familiar from the united states
a so-called peer jury will experiment will begin in helsinki to prevent young people to getting into a vicious circle of crime .
at first the experiment will be applied to those under 15 , who now are left without criminal responsibility .
a jury of peers will weigh in on the first crime a young person commits .
the idea is that the jury of peers will discuss what happened with the offender and prescribe a sanction .
a week later the offender can join the jury of peers themselves to make up for what they did .
other consequences could be for example a letter written to the family explaining , what has been done and what has been learnt from it .
youth work director tommi laitio says it is not a strict model .
we also have other conciliation models that are used side by side .
“ they all direct a young person ’ s actions towards a more responsible direction , so that everything would not be ruined after the first mistake ” , says laitio .
the model for the jury of peers comes from the united states , where it is widely used .
the idea is that after their first crime , the young person doesn ’ t have to stand in front of an adult panel , but can reflect what has happened together with other people of approximately the same age .
the model has been tested once .
ilkka lovio , service designer from service design office palmu who has followed the experiment says that it was an assault that was successfully cleared up .
before the first crimes of especially those under 15 years of age have not necessarily been dealt with at all .
“ it has been a message to carry on on the path you have chosen ” , lovio says .
the peer jury is part of a project focusing on immigrants in helsinki ( maahanmuuttajien helsinki ) , on the background of which are the city of helsinki and the we foundation .
lovio emphasises that these new practises are offered to all who need them , not just for young immigrants .
over 70 republican leaders want the party to stop funding trump ’ s campaign
more than 70 influential republicans are said to sign a letter asking the party to stop funding donald trump &apos;s presidential campaign .
an american newspaper politico reported about the letter , the draft of which it has obtained .
according to the newspaper , the letter is directed to the republican national committee chairman reince priebus .
the signees want the party ’ s money to be put toward congressional races , instead of trump ’ s campaign .
“ we believe that donald trump ’ s divisiveness , recklessness , incompetence , and record-breaking unpopularity risk turning this election into a democratic landslide ” , it says in the letter as reported by politico .
only the immediate shift of all available rnc resources to vulnerable senate and house races will prevent the gop from drowning with a trump-emblazoned anchor around its neck .
according to the letter , this should not be a difficult decision , as trump ’ s chances of being elected president are evaporating by the day .
politico writes that the letter is expected to be sent next week .
politicians gordon humphrey , chris shays , tom coleman , and vin weber are among the signees .
republican andrew weinstein , a vocal anti-trump republican , is one of the operatives organizing the letter .
according to politico , weinstein has said that the letter is coming from “ people who want the party to protect its majorities in the senate and the house ” , and that it ’ s not an endorsement of anybody .
the letter ticks off a series of donald trump actions that are believed to have alienated millions of voters .
he is said to also have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies .
earlier this week 50 officials working among national security wrote an open letter to state that they won ’ t support donald trump as a president .
clinton promises relief to u.s. families with children
in the united states , the democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton shared details of his economic policy on thursday evening .
i aim to be the president , so that the u.s. economy would be good for everyone .
“ donald trump aims to be the president , so that the economy would be good for him and his friends ” , clinton said in her speech .
in the centre of clinton ’ s plan is a massive five-year , 275-billion dollar plan to improve united states ’ infrastructure , roads , bridges , and airfields .
this would be financed partly with tax increases for the rich , partly with private money .
this building programme is a friendly gesture to american workers who suffered as factories were transferred to countries with cheap labour .
clinton called this programme the greatest investment in well-paid jobs since the second world war .
we are a nation of builders , we must return to building !
clinton said .
on thursday , clinton also promised to ease the situation of working families with children .
on thursday , she sounded like sanders anyway as she emphasised that the rich should pay their fair share of the taxes .
and if a company leaves the united states as a tax exile , it should pay a leaving tax , clinton said .
nowadays she opposes the trans-pacific partnership she used to support .
“ &#91; as the president , &#93; i will oppose all those trade agreements that work against employees or wages ” , clinton promised .
according to the speculations published by the washington post before clinton ’ s speech , clinton was going to criticise the economic platform by republican donald trump published on monday about it “ only favours millionaires like him ” .
clinton has previously called trump ’ s suggestion of a whacking tax cut to corporation taxes “ his loophole ” .
on thursday , clinton emphasised that she herself is a daughter of a small entrepreneur .
she reminded the listeners about small entrepreneurs , whose invoices trump has left unpaid , and about clothes , trump himself fabricates in china and mexico .
“ if he wants to make america great again , he should start by manufacturing products in america himself ” , clinton mocked .
this is what rio ’ s ratings look like : apparently the competition hasn ’ t managed to glue finns to their screens , but the mobile application is interesting
usually sporting events are shown as sharp peaks in television ratings .
so far , the rio olympic games haven ’ t reached huge viewer ratings .
at a time the games have glued 12 per cent of the population to their screens at its best : swimming on yle ’ s olympic channel , tv2 , on tuesday night was followed by 615,000 viewers .
for the sake of comparison : the european athletics championships a month ago got almost 800,000 viewers at a time , and uefa european championships ’ number was well over a million .
so far , the most interesting olympic sports have been cycling on sunday evening and artistic gymnastics that opened the fifth game day . both of these reached almost half a million viewers at a time on the olympic channel .
the head of yle sport , panu pokkinen , is satisfied with the ratings and notes that for the first time ever , the viewers are divided between several different devices .
in addition to television , finns follow the olympics from rio areena .
we are satisfied with how many tv viewers choose the olympics in the first place .
even on the television side , the viewers are divided between tv2 and yle fem channels .
rio olympics is the first sporting event yle has dedicated a whole channel to .
when there is broadcast 24 hours a day , and there are 20,000 to 500,000 viewers all the time , it ’ s a good basis .
the viewer ratings are lower than in london 2012 or beijing 2008 , but one reason for this is the time difference - most of the rio games are broadcast in finland during the night time .
another reason for the tame interest - if someone thinks it ’ s tame - surely is the traditional finnish reason : if finland had won a surprising medal early on , the interest would ’ ve surely jumped with it .
in addition , the athletics is only just beginning , as well as other sports that interest finns : sailing and riding .
according to pokkinen , the ratings of the beginning were close to what was expected .
when the athletics begin , the ratings explode .
yle launched a yle rio 2016 mobile application for the games , and during the first game days it became apple app store &apos;s most downloaded free application in finland .
by monday , the application had been downloaded 150,000 times .
i guess that now we &apos;re somewhere around 200,000 downloads .
“ we will get the online ratings only later ” , says pokkinen .
rio areena has not worked as desired with all the users .
pokkinen says they &apos;ve had feedback and have managed to fix the bugs .
the use of rio areena has included time lag and other small , technical issues in the beginning .
there are now updated versions of the applications that should fix these bugs .
rio olympics have a wider coverage on yle ’ s channels and in areena than any other sporting event ever before .
some sports can be followed on yle fem channel , and in yle puhe in radio broadcasts the games daily .
in addition for the olympics being possible the most laborious ever for yle , they are also the last one that can be followed only from yle channels .
from the year 2018 onwards olympic sports can be seen both on yle and on commercial channels .
how deep is finland ’ s deepest lake ?
according to official statistics , the deepest lake in finland is päijänne , it &apos;s depth being 95,3 metres at ristinselkä .
it might be even deeper .
technique diving instructor matti kannela found a hollow sized approximately 20 square metres from ristiselkä , and the diving computer showed its bottom depth to be 104 metres .
in summer 2014 , finnish environment institute attempted to confirm the finding using echo-sounding , but it was in vain .
the method does not necessarily find a small hollow from a hundred metres , says development engineer jari hakala .
so for now the official depth is still 95,3 metres .
other deep lakes include inarijärvi ( 92 metres ) and suvasvesi ( 90 metres ) .
saimaa , toisvesi , and pääjärvi reach over 80 metres .
they have not been studied as much as päijänne .
especially inarijärvi ’ s bottom has not been carefully mapped .
“ there might well be some unknown depths ” , kannela ponders .
if the deepest lake is defined by its average depth , it would be suuri jukajärvi , 23 metres .
this way examined , päijänne is not among the top ten of the deepest , and suvasvesi is even farther from the top .
edited 12 august 2.29 pm : final paragraph edited , because the deepest lakes by their average depth were wrong .
ihalainen concerning tax reductions : pensioners ’ taxation still harder
pensioners ’ taxation is still tighter than the wage-earners ’ .
ihalainen says this disadvantage emerged just before the general election , and it was promised the pensioners ’ taxation would be made more equal compared to the wage-earners .
there is nothing like this in the government ’ s proposal .
we think it should definitely be there .
given promises should be kept after the election , he says to lännen media .
in the beginning of this year , wage-earners got income tax deductions that reduces the taxation .
the issue heated up the members of the opposition , who grilled the then minister of finance , alexander stubb ( coalition ) , about the election promises .
purchasing power secured , will not grow
according to ihalainen , the tax deductions in the definition of policy presented by the minister of finance , petteri orpo ( coalition ) , are more about securing purchase power than increasing it , because wages will not be raised next year .
he says the tax deduction has a positive impact on purchase power and employment , if there are no other things that add to people ’ s uncertainty .
ihalainen is pleased with the prime minister juha sipilä &apos;s ( centre ) and orpo ’ s messages about the will to respect the hard-won competitiveness pact .
he says adhering to the pact is important credibility-wise .
it is the most important action in both economic and employment policies .
it is done jointly with the labour market organisations , so it should not be spoiled by challenging it .
it is necessary , because the economy relies so much on the domestic demand and on people &apos;s own optimism about the future .
prolonged unemployment must be discussed in the government budget session
ihalainen appeals to the government to discuss long-term unemployment in its budget session , at least to stop its increase .
in june , there were 17,000 more long-term unemployed people than a year before .
he says that if this growth will not stop , the government ’ s goal of increasing the employment rate to 72 per cent will be lost .
he warns that if the challenge posed by prolonged unemployment is overlooked , it will mean a very large societal bill .
ambassador : no known finnish victims in the thailand attacks
the bomb attacks in thailand that happened during last evening and night ( cet ) killed at least four people .
the embassy advises all the finnish people in the country to be watchful and to avoid the busiest tourist areas , and to follow the authorities ’ directions .
those finnish tourists that are planning to travel to thailand should not cancel their journey because of the explosions , but they should follow the embassy ’ s advice about caution , says westphalen .
very few finns in thailand
according to westphalen , currently there are very few finns in thailand , although their exact numbers are difficult to estimate .
finns ’ travelling season to thailand takes place around turn of the year .
most travellers to thailand this time of year come from southern europe and china .
after the bomb attacks , the finnish embassy has got some comments via facebook from finns in thailand .
the embassy has attempted to contact especially those finns that are in hua hin , in order to get information about the town ’ s situation .
however , several of our contacts in hua hin are currently out of town .
generally speaking everything seems to be fine , westphalen says .
no information about the responsible party
according to westphalen , there is no information about who is responsible for the attack .
the ambassador thinks the incidents may be connected to the political unrest in thailand ’ s disunited society , and to the referendum last week about the constitution drawn up by the military junta .
the law passed in the referendum .
the referendum was not an open , democratic process .
in the country people got for example arrested , when they had declared that they oppose the law .
as for the southern provinces in thailand , there smoulders an ethnic-racial conflict related to the muslim population , says westphalen .
the muslims want to increase their autonomy .
however , there has not been any earlier attacks to tourist attractions .
there was a big , local festival day in bangkok today , says westphalen .
according to her , the city is celebrating the queen &apos;s birthday and mothers ’ day .
there isn ’ t a lot of traffic in the city .
the attack most likely have such an effect on the daily routines that the authorities will be very strict about security .
thailand police : the attacks are not international terrorism
according to the police , the attacks are “ local sabotage ” and differ from customary terrorist attacks .
also islamic terrorism has been ruled out , thailand police report according to the news agency ap .
at least four people have died in thailand during 24 hours , as 11 bombs have exploded around the country , like for example in tourist favourites phuket and hua hin .
there were four bombs that exploded in a tourist attraction also favoured by the finns , on holiday island phuket , reports thai newspaper bangkok post .
according to current information , they did not claim any lives .
the paper says two of the bombs exploded on patong beach .
in addition , two bombs exploded in phang nga , where one person was wounded , according to the paper .
in a popular tourist attraction , hua hin , the local authorities report that a total of four bombs has exploded yesterday and today .
both double bombings killed at least one .
furthermore , at least one bomb exploded in both the village of surat thani and the city of trang in south-thailand .
both bombings killed at least one .
also surat thani is familiar to many a traveller , since the way to ko samui , ko pha ngan , and ko tao holiday islands goes through it .
the quarter responsible for the attacks is not known
according to prayut chan-o-cha , head of the military junta ruling thailand , the quarter responsible for the attacks is so far not known .
the bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion .
we should not stir up any more panic in the people , he said to the journalists .
according to gen. prawit wongsuwan , deputy prime minister in charge of security , at least the hua hin and trang attacks are linked .
he said to thai bsb that the offenders ’ purpose has been to destroy the tourism in the country , since all the attacks happened in tourist attractions .
the finnish embassy advises all the finnish people in the country to be watchful and to avoid the busiest tourist areas , and to follow the authorities ’ directions .
those finns that are planning to travel to thailand should not cancel their journey because of the explosions , but they should follow the embassy ’ s advice about caution , says westphalen .
europeans among the wounded
so far , there is very little information about the attacks that happened during the finnish night time or their victims .
a little more information has been received from the yesterday evening ’ s attack in hua hin .
a local woman died and over 20 others were injured in it , and among the wounded there were at least nine foreign tourists .
there are at least german , italian , dutch , and austrian people among the wounded .
at least three people were wounded in the second hua hin attack .
two bombs exploded near a clock tower known as an attraction .
thai pbs reports that the police have roped of the hua hin area they believe to have found yet another bomb .
according to the province governor , the surat thani bomb was hidden in a flowerbed .
one municipality employee died in the attack .
at least one was wounded .
the chief of police said in the cnn interview that there were two bombs used also in the surat thani attack , and that they went off about at about half an hour interval .
according to the bangkok post , the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations .
biles from the u.s. won the women &apos;s all-around
alexandra raisman from the u.s. was the second with a score of 60.098 , and russia ’ s alija mustafina was the third with her score of 58.665 points .
biles , 18 , is still striving for gold in floor , vault , and balance beam in the rio olympics .
biles has dominated women &apos;s gymnastics at will during the last years .
she has 8 personal world championships from three previous seasons .
she has won gold in all-around and floor three consecutive times , and in balance beam last year and year before that .
biles also has two team championships in the u.s. team .
biles has won other medals besides gold from vault and balance beam .
a finnish entrepreneur in thailand : “ the attack has no effect on tourism ”
esa huovila , who runs a real estate agency and a children ’ s play club in the same premises in phuket , is not worried about the effect the thailand ’ s bomb attacks have on tourism .
if there are no more attacks , i believe nothing much will follow from this , estimates huovila , a finnish entrepreneur who has worked in asia about two decades .
the experienced entrepreneur has seen many tragedies in thailand close up .
there is always something here .
first a tsunami , then the bird flu , and last year a bomb attack in bangkok .
if these earlier ones didn ’ t chase the tourists away , i doubt this will , either .
huovila ’ s company offices are located a few hundred metres from the bomb attack scene .
huovila heard about the attack from his own employee .
the employee called him about nine o ’ clock local time and said he should not come to the office .
huovila says that both the promenade and the main street , bangla road , were completely closed early in the morning because of the attacks .
many of my local employees came to the workplace as usual in the morning .
they thought the road blocks were set up because of the queen ’ s birthday , huovila says referring to friday ’ s holiday in thailand .
at patong , the atmosphere was calm , and the businesses on the main street were allowed to open at around 10 local time .
at the beach , many of the people hadn ’ t even heard about the attacks .
around 2.30 in the afternoon thailand ’ s time , the traffic at patong had returned to normal , and most of the shops had opened their doors .
based on the attack place , the explosion was relatively small , says huovila , who went to see the attack place .
later the car in question was spotted in jouxholmintie , kruunupyy .
when the police reached the place , the car was set on fire .
the patrol saw two men that fit the descriptions hiding in a nearby spruce copse .
one of the men was immediately caught .
the other made a run for it , but was later found from the forest with the help of a police dog .
the men are suspected to be guilty of stealing of a motor vehicle for temporary use , theft , and gross damage .
the police thanks all those who gave tip-offs .
director of research about changes in russian leadership : clearly a move aside
on friday russia had its most high-ranking leadership change in years , as president vladimir putin removed his chief of staff sergei ivanov .
ivanov ’ s successor is a 44-year old anton vaino of estonian background .
he is an ex-diplomat and has been ivanov ’ s deputy .
kangaspuro says that a reason behind ivanov ’ s dismissal can be putin ’ s will to prevent strong people around him of gathering too much power .
he adds that rotating leadership tasks is one way of using power .
this is a way to prevent people from increasing their power independent of the president .
according to kangaspuro , it is also possible that ivanov has been in trouble with other leaders or that he has blundered .
a drop in status for ivanov
ivanov , who has been part of putin &apos;s inner circle , is now transferring to be the ecology and transport special representative .
on a tape presented by the state media putin said the change was a mutual decision .
putin said that ivanov himself had requested a transfer to another role , and had proposed vaino as a candidate for his position , reported russia today .
kangaspuro says that from ivanov ’ s point of view , this is a clear drop in status .
ecological or transport matters do not have a very high priority in russia .
he points out that ivanov has been one of the most important people on the top or russian power .
in addition , ivanov has had a significant role in the president ’ s security council .
during soviet times , ivanov worked at kgb together with putin .
he was considered as putin ’ s possible successor in 2008 , but dmitri medvedev became the president .
kangaspuro points out that the old guard , for example the governors , has been recently replaced in russia .
senior research fellow katri pynnöniemi from the finnish institute of international affairs says that the fact that putin is replacing his inner circle with younger people is more interesting than who is ivanov &apos;s successor .
isis fighters used civilians as human shields while retreating in syria
they used the civilians as human shields as they withdrew to jarabulus , thus preventing us from targeting them , said sherfan darwish , spokesman for the manbij military council .
the syrian observatory for human rights said the civilians were placed in hundreds of cars , where they were taken to jarabulus .
the arab and kurd fighters managed to seize 90 per cent of the manbij town that was important for isis .
it is estimated , though , that dozens of jihadists remained in the town then .
earlier news edited at 7.30 pm : earlier we mistakenly told that the civilians are fleeing the town , as it really was the isis fighters who kidnapped the civilians while fleeing the town .
professor : the ministry of the interior ’ s definition of document access policy is unlawful
the ministry of the interior ’ s definition of document access policy is unlawful , says professor of public law , tomi voutilainen , from the university of eastern finland .
voutilainen says to stt that document access cannot be based on an official ’ s own policies , but it is based on law .

usain bolt ’ s final olympic show begins in rio
like in recent years , before elite competitions , bolt has been running against time .
early in the season , he hurt his back thigh , and had to pass olympic qualifications in jamaica .
it has not been the perfect build-up but i am in much better shape
i &apos;ve been training well , and that ’ s the key thing , bolt said in his press conference in rio .
that press conference included scantily clad samba dancers and reporters that had turned into fans .
the murmuring around bolt underlines that fact that the star of the jamaican has risen during the age when athletics has struggled with doping scandals and sliding interest .
bolt previous defeat in olympic games was in athens 2004 , when he was eliminated in 200 metres preliminaries with a time of 21,05 .
back then bolt , aged 17 , was a young promise slowed down by injuries and lax attitude towards practising .
four years later in beijing , he started his reign on the hundred metres , when he crushed the world record and the competitors ’ self-confidence with a time of 9,69 , reached despite the final celebrations .
this is harder
a year later in the world championship in berlin , bolt reached the culmination of his career when measured with time .
the world records from berlin , 9,58 for hundred metres and 19,19 for two hundred , are still valid .
bolt has announced that in rio his goals are the world record for 200 metres and going under 19 seconds , but no one believes this besides bolt himself .
on 100m bolt ’ s biggest challenger is justin gatlin , who one olympic gold in athens 2004 for this distance .
last year in beijing wc finals bolt won the american by only one hundredth of a second .
during his reign that began in beijing , bolt has not lost once in an elite competition finals , if only he has managed to start .
in daegu 2011 , bolt did not run in the 100m wc finals because of a false start .
in bit over a week , bolt will be 30 .
he is an old man in young men ’ s sport , and rio games are his final olympics .
bolt has set the final finish line for his career to be next year &apos;s wc games in london .
these are the olympics that separate me from the pack .
i ’ m older now , and it ’ s harder for me .
but anytime i start feeling really down , i remind myself , you have got to get this done this year , bolt said three months ago in a sports illustrated interview .

i just try to have a little bit of fun , laughs bbc ’ s olympic swimming commentator helen skelton in iltalehti ’ s quick interview .
monday ’ s story about helen skelton ( on the right ) is one of the most read ones on the iltalehti website this week .
next to commentator rebecca adlington .
skelton doesn ’ t really stress , if there ’ s some fuss in the social media or british press about her revealing and unique outfits .
television is a visual media , she emphasises .
skelton is wearing high heels and a shortish dress that certainly is adequately revealing - at least for many conservative british viewers ’ eyes .
there will be no steps backwards , though .
it is important to look good , and small sensations are only a fun thing .
surely skelton want to cut a dash and possible startle , too , but she stresses that she doesn ’ t want to be in the main role .
this is not about me , she states .
we ’ re here to watch sports , and the focus should be on the athletes .
it shouldn ’ t matter so much how i dress myself .
can you imagine that the sensation has reached finland , too ?
no , i cannot , but anything that draws the focus on how hard these swimmers are working and on the big sacrifices they ’ re doing is fine by me , grins skelton .
you know what ?
it ’ s much ado about nothing , if the ( commentator &apos;s ) dressing causes it .
i ’ m a little amused , if this has hit someone ’ s radar .

7 curious things that , according to science , prolong your life
science has studied everything possible between the heaven and the earth .
these things have been proven to bring extra years to a person ’ s life .
some of these thing are habits that , either directly or indirectly , will affect a person ’ s health in a way that prolongs their life .
sometimes the things a person can ’ t influence themselves can bring them extra years .
these are for example tendency towards abdominal obesity or social status .
going shopping regularly can prolong your life .
it ’ s not always even necessary to spend - just picking up a carton of milk is enough .
there are many studies that have aimed at discovering the secret behind long age .
medical daily presented seven of the most peculiar research results .
according to science , all of these things may bring you more years for your life .
drinking beer and coffee
drinking coffee has been shown to provide a protective effect against certain cancers , type 2 diabetes , as well as alzheimer ’ s and parkinson ’ s disease .
according to the study by harvard university , moderate coffee consumption was linked to a “ lower risk of death ” , especially from heart and neurological diseases .
as for alcohol , there are studies that say drinking a moderate amount of one to three drinks a day may prolong your life .
for example , one study found wine drinkers were more likely to outlive those who did not drink at all .
regular flossing can possibly add more than six years to a person ’ s life , according to a research .
the claim is based on the fact this prevents inflamed gums .
these in turn can lead to increase in the risk of developing other diseases throughout the body .
a study conducted in norway found out how laughing affects your lifespan .
a seven-year-project tracked over 54,000 people .
those who laughed more were 35 per cent more likely to still be alive at the end of the study .
sex , when the protection against stds is taken into consideration , is good for your health according to many studies .
in addition , it can also add years to your life .
unfortunately , just having sex as it is , is not enough .
in order for a person to gain extra years to their life , they also need to climax .
being physically active sure brings extra years , there ’ s no denying that .
however , long life doesn ’ t necessarily require absolute leanness .
a study from oxford university found out that women with a bigger backside tended to have lower levels of cholesterol .
they also had higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids in their system .
the same study connected these things to an overall lower risk of mortality .
whether it ’ s a person who earned a medal in the olympics or an actor who won an oscar , they are more likely to live longer than your average man .
many studies have attempted to find a reason for the phenomenon .
one explanation could be that an ambitious person most likely lives in a way that brings extra years to their life .
some researchers speculate that long life is caused by the person ’ s social status - which for its part enables the pursuit of accolades such as the nobel prize .
a study of shopping behaviour of people ages 65 and older found that a person who goes shopping every day is more likely to live longer than someone who shops less .
this is because going to a concrete shop reduces loneliness .
that , on its turn , has been shown to trigger biological changes that may lead to an early death .
so put down that credit card - online shopping does not have the same effect .

a district court sentenced posti for committing a breach of the anti-discrimination act
posti had no right to keep the wages of an employee who declined to give workplace initiation to an agency contract worker , estimated the district court of tavastia proper in its sentence .
the district court enjoined posti to pay the employee most of the retained wages and 2000 euros as compensation for discrimination .
according to the sentence , posti could have retained just that part of the initiator ’ s wages that was equal to the initiation part of the whole day ’ s work .
the district court said the employee had been , against the anti-discrimination act , placed in an unfavourable position based on their trade unionism .
the employee had followed the finnish post and logistics union pau ’ s union decision about workplace initiation ban .

bbc : man united ’ s big signing suspended - he won ’ t be in the first match of the premier league
football signings ’ world-record man won ’ t be seen on the field , when the english premier league will begin this weekend .
paul pogba &apos;s suspension followed him to england .

according to british media , man united paid 105 million euros for pogba to italian team juventus .
the english football association fa is keeping him from the game , because pogba got a suspension in juventus .
he got two yellow cards in last season ’ s coppa italia , and that results in a one game ban .
this ban has carried over to england , fa told the bbc .
pogba ’ s next possibility to play is on the second round of the league on august 19 , when man united plays against southampton .
at flow , megalomania is a virtue
the precise criteria of enjoyment and ambitious visions have established the status of flow festival as an internationally respected event starred by the top artists in the world .
flow festival begins on friday in helsinki .
the festival guests have typically expressed themselves with individual dressing .
one of the main stage artists this year is the punk legend iggy pop .
the flow festival event area is styled with for example artificial turf and art installations .
for us , it has never been enough just to have a main stage and a beer tent , says the artistic director of the event , tuomas kallio .
flow festival , organised in suvilahti , helsinki , this weekend , has grown from a small block festival to an event with tens of thousands visitors .
behind the success , there is a simple question : what kind of an event would the organisers themselves want to attend ?
thinking this way is quite exceptional in event production .
most of the time the goal is to reach the level of necessity and to act according to the authorities ’ orders , says artistic director tuomas kallio .
a week before the event he knew , that flow will sell out also this year .
the goal has been to increase the last year ’ s number of visitors , 70.000 , by 5.000 people .
there will be a group of interesting domestic and foreign artists at the festival also this year .
the growth of the visitor number is a good thing , because the operations have to funded someway .
on the other hand , we don &apos;t want to grow too much , because at some point the masses would be like cattle that is herded in huge channels .
we don ’ t want that .
during 13 years , the ideology of a successful event has been magnified in a way that the area , partly decorated with artificial turf , hosts 130 performers , art installations , and a number of restaurant points and cocktail bars .
in addition to the main stage and the smaller stages , this year there will be gigs in a tent accommodating 15.000 people .
kallio admits that the event could be implemented also in a simpler way .
i may be a bit megalomaniac , but at the same time , we have managed to retain the flow spirit .
if you lose it , this is no longer our thing .
for kallio , the greatest joy and reward for the work done is that nowadays even big visions are practically possible .
in the early years of the event , mid 00s , the operation was very dependent on the support of about 20.000 euros from the city of helsinki .
last year the turnover of the limited company that manages flow was about six million euros .
with it , it ’ s possible to create “ even crazy things ” , like building that tent 73 meters wide .
the guests at flow have typically expressed themselves with individual dressing .
in addition to a music event , one can also call this a community of trendy young adults .
however , the event has not purposely profiled itself as especially fashionable .
above all , we want to stand out because of our content .
still , also fads fit in to flow ’ s set of values : curiosity and the desire to interact with the environment , says kallio .
this year one of the main stage artists is a legend of punk , 69 years old iggy pop .
in his own genre , the man has a huge fan crowd , but he isn ’ t the most typical performer in a festival combining indie rock , pop music , rap , and soul .
according to kallio iggy was booked , since this is most likely the last time the artist is gigging in finland .
we are interested in everything , history and future .
not just what is played in commercial radio .
iggy ’ s latest album was bloody good , and he has performed bloody well on his gigs in recent years .
the bombs in thai tourist paradise were hidden in flower pots - horrified tourists escaped
on thursday evening local time , two bombs exploded in hua hin .
at least one local woman died and over 20 were wounded in the attack .
the bombs were probably hidden in a flower pot and then detonated using cell phones .
the bombs were located on a street where most of the customers are foreign .
they went off at the same time as the tourists began to leave the bars to go back to their hotels , said a police spokesman samoer yoosumran according to cnn .
a wildlife protectionist ewin wiek , who has lived in asia since 1989 , tweeted a revealing image about the attacks .
if the tweet isn ’ t visible , you can see it here .
at least 11 of those wounded in hua hin were foreign tourists .
people were running towards me saying that a bomb has exploded near the bars .
it happened on one of the biggest bar streets , said swedish tourist emelie olsson to aftonbladet .
in the next morning local time two bombs went off in surat thani .
at least one died .
the number of the wounded is not yet known .
very soon after this , two bombs went off on the island of phuket that is popular also among finns .
as far as is known , nobody died .
at the same time there was another double bombing in hua hin .
at least one died and three were wounded .
in addition , one bomb went off in the town of trang .
the police said they had found at least one bomb from hua hin that had not yet exploded .
according to the thai authorities , those responsible for the bomb attacks are most likely rebel groups that are not satisfied with the actions of thailand ’ s military leadership .
the local authorities estimate a criminal organisation might also be the culprit .
according to aftonbladet , the police has lately been snapping at the criminal organisations dealing in human trafficking .
ksml : this part of the new readiness units are the first to go into battle in war situations
in an acute war situation , the conscripts won ’ t be sent to battle until several months after they have sworn their oath , says keskisuomalainen .
the newspaper interviewed the chief of education of the finnish defence forces , brigadier general jukka sonninen , who said that for example from those conscripts that serve 5,5 months only those are effective who are finishing their training .
according to the chief of education , the first ones to be called up are those reservists who are part of the readiness units .
no conscripts or reservists are called up to a duty they do not have the required training for , says sonninen .
earlier in the summer it was found out that the finnish defence forces begin to train conscripts to readiness units from the beginning of the next year .
the units can be used in military operations already during the conscript training , if necessary .
pamela tola got giant indemnification for a mouldy home
actress pamela tola and her ex-husband , ceo pauli waroma , have won a hard argument about a house they bought from espoo in 2009 .
the purchase price of a two-storey detached house had been 330,000 euros .
after the closing of the deal , a serious moisture problem was revealed in the house , causing unhealthy microbe growth .
the couple had to sell the house to be demolished in 2014 .
the price had dropped to 132,000 euros , so tola and waroma ’ s financial loss was no less than 198,000 euros .
the couple filed the matter in court and there claimed a price reduction from the seller .
the seller contested the claim , but tola and waroma won the case in both the district court and the court of appeal .
the court of appeal passed judgement on the matter on wednesday .
it retained in force the district court judgement by which the seller was imposed to pay a price reduction of 150,000 euros to tola and waroma .
in addition , the seller has to cover the couple ’ s legal and settlement costs for a total of 47,000 euros .
the price reduction was made slightly equitable by the court , since buyers did know some of the house ’ s needs for repairs when they were buying the home .
however , according to the court of appeals , the construction defects that appeared were significantly more serious than what had been presented .
tola was looking for a house in good condition
at the court of appeal tola told that the couple had been specifically looking for a home in good condition , since they didn ’ t want to do repair work .
she had formed an understanding that the building had been renovated and was in good condition , and that there would be no disadvantages from the matters mentioned in the condition inspection report .
the risks and defects mentioned in the condition inspection report were ventilation and that the management of rain and melt waters running along the rock surface was not sufficient .
based on the discussions it wasn ’ t however revealed that this would be an urgent matter at all .
tola and waroma had the impression that the rain waters from the rock should probably be slightly directed within a couple of years .
the deal was closed in october 2009 .
within a few years it appeared that the humidity problems of the house were much more serious than previously thought .
in inspections in 2012 and 2013 , microbe growth was found from the building . according to witnesses , this was caused both by the rock rain waters and earth humidity that had risen to the surface by capillary action .
according to the inspector ’ s evaluation , on the west side of the house microbe-infested air could also enter to the inside of the house through the porch .
mould or yeast that enables a health risk and exceeds the limit values was found in smear samples taken from the utility room , basement staircase , living room bay window , and basement washroom .
the patios were built without permits .
there was also argument in the court about whether the house had been extended against the building permit .
the court held that before closing of the deal , tola and waroma were not aware of the espoo city decision that there had been changes to the house that were against the permit .
for example the patios had been built even though there were no proper permits yet .
however , the mould problems were the crucial matter at court .
according to the court of appeal , based on the information they got from the seller before the deal , the buyers had reason to assume that the building was suitable for living as is , and that there was no need for large repairs in the near future .
in the court of appeal ’ s opinion , tola and waroma had no special reason to conduct an unusually extensive inspection .
the buyers have not neglected their duty to investigate , stated the court of appeal in its decision .
a spine-chilling find from the archives : hundreds of thousands of women wanted to bear children for the nazis - the register also includes finns
journalist christopher andersson describes in his recent article in dagens nyheter , how there are microfilms in the national archives in maryland , u.s. , that contain documents concerning a total of 218,000 women , who all wanted to marry an ss man .
most of the women are german , but there are also american , french , dutch , and russian women .
in addition , there were at least 65 danish , 86 norwegian , 14 finnish , and 31 swedish women who wanted to be nazi brides .
the documents and register cards that come from the race office that operated in nazi germany .
the race office operated under ss leader heinrich himmler .
none of ss men in nazi germany were allowed to have children before they were examined by an ss doctor .
the same was even more true to women , who had to be able to give birth to even more than 10 children .
according to andersson , women were given gynaecological examinations to confirm this .
the race office checked the women ’ s backgrounds by checking for example the church registers .
the goal was to ensure that there were no jews in the women ’ s family tree .
the women also had to be ready to give up their swedish citizenship , and to give the race office their handwritten biographies , and good references from their next of kin .
the race office wanted guarantees of the women being “ fond of children ” , “ frugal ” , and “ good national socialists ” , who could speak german well .
the women who did not fulfil these requirements were not accepted as brides for the ss men .
the story does not tell , what happened to the 14 finnish women found from the archive ’ s documents .
the ss leaders created a state-supported programme known as lebensborn in 1936 .
the programme for example determined that each ss men should have four children , either in or out of wedlock .
lebensborn homes took care of the children born out of wedlock and their mothers .
the programme was not very actively promoted , though , it says on the website of the united states holocaust memorial museum .
instead , the nazi population policies were focused on family and marriage .
the state encouraged marrying by offering loans and supported having children .
the cross of honor of the german mother was given to women , who had borne at least four children .
marriages between “ aryans ” and “ non-aryans ” were forbidden by law in nazi germany , it is stated on the museum website .

tuuli petäjä-siren fought for places 17 and three in the day ’ s rs : x class ’ starts .

jari sillanpää &apos;s satulinna was recorded after a couple of hours sleep : “ i was so hung-over ”
jari sillanpää has been one of the finns ’ favourite artists already for over 20 years .
from a barman on a cruise ship to tango king in 1995 , to the best-selling solo artist in finland and to a star of dance pavilions and festival - sillanpää just keeps rolling along , and has a great momentum at the moment .
the book , jari sillanpää - paljaana , written by mari koppinen , tells about the life of the favourite singer and was published today , on thursday .
in the book sillanpää narrates his life and career , be it positive or negative .
sillanpää ’ s career soared when he won the crown of the tango king at seinäjoki tangomarkkinat festival in 1995 .
in the competition sillanpää sang tangos , but already then he had planned somewhat different music for himself .
in the spring of 1995 , jukka kuoppamäki had composed a tango for sillanpää at his request , and kassu halonen then arranged it to a slightly different form .
and the song ‘ satulinna ’ did become one of the most popular songs in finnish music history .
the book tells that the recording of the song did not quite go according to plans : sillanpää had a terrible hangover when he sang the song on tape , and he had only slept for a couple of hours .
we ’ d had a party the previous night .
i was so hung-over !
sillanpää recalls in the book .
based on the recording of the song that became an enormous hit , one wouldn ’ t guess that it was sang while hangover .
even though i wasn ’ t physically at my best , the result was still good .
i learned that you don ’ t have to require perfection and top result from yourself all the time .
another incident , narrated in the book and relating to his most popular songs , happened almost two decades later .
in 2013 , sillanpää separated from his then partner , and the incident also ended up in the texts of ‘ sinä ansaitset kultaa ’ song that was published as a single in 2014 .
the book relates that the lyrics that were commissioned from saara törmänen weren &apos;t what sillanpää would &apos;ve wanted .
sillanpää had imagined he was doing a record that tells a true story of his own life , but the lyrics of the song about break-up weren ’ t true , but written based on a piece of news from 7 päivää magazine .
in the magazine article the reason given for the break-up between jari and his ex-love was jari ’ s excessive partying and drinking , but this is pure nonsense according to jari and simply not true .
according to book , jari was furious when he called to the record company and refused to sing the song , but finally decided on singing it - and that ’ s good .
in june the brits managed to surprise even themselves by voting their kingdom out of the eu .
in the end , 52 per cent of the voters supported the exit and 48 per cent would have stayed in the union , even though the opinion polls from the vote week anticipated an opposite result .
the economists and economic institutions of britain were nearly unanimous in supporting staying in the eu .
not one of the respected research institutes or universities carried the exit flag , even though a couple of individual researchers dared to differ from the mainstream of their profession .
the basic mantra of the western politics , the catchphrase from the election campaign of the ex-us president bill clinton , “ it &apos;s the economy , stupid ” , was scrapped in britain ’ s brexit vote .
the economists were shocked , when their voices were not heard .
they were shocked , when it seemed that economy was not the most important thing in politics .
economic curly speech
in its latest monthly questionnaire , the centre for macroeconomics demands answers for brexit disaster from the professional society .
the most typical answer is that the economists were not listened to , because this time the voters based their decision on something other than economic grounds .
one economist explanation for the loss of economy &apos;s position is that people do not understand the economy .
many still have an image that the number of jobs does not depend on the number of working people , so that it is almost constant .
if an immigrant gets a job , it is taken from a real brit .
many also have an impression that it would be a good thing if the value of the currency fell , since it promotes the exporting industries .
according to the economist base , the voters did not believe the economic arguments , since the unanimity of the economists did not come up enough .
they were especially annoyed by the bbc impartiality that gave the same space both to those economists supporting the eu exit that only present a couple of per cent of the economist base , and the overwhelming majority .
the press , hostile to eu , were not interested in mentioning what ifs , ifm , boe , cepr , lse , and other powerful economic letter combinations thought of the exit consequences .
those distant letter combinations spoke facelessly about economic growth , trade relations , national debt , and currency .
and if the economists ’ messages were both listened to and understood , then they were disregarded , because the economists present such elite with which the voters do not think to have anything in common .
the big city academics such as economists would have stayed in the eu , but in small towns and in countryside the message was ineffective .
immigration is also economy
the overwhelming winning argument in the brexit vote concerned immigration .
an immigrant will take your job , an immigrant will jam your hospitals , an immigrant will abuse you .
these were the arguments that worked .
every cafe has foreign employees .
how many more jobs would the brits have , if they were to leave ?
there are immigrants in every waiting room of every health centre .
how much easier would it be for a brit to have a doctor &apos;s appointment , if they weren ’ t here ?
every school has immigrants ’ children , too .
how much easier would it be for the children of a true brit to have a school place , if we could get rid of them ?
there are foreigners living in every municipality .
how much more space would the natives have , if they would vanish ?
i feel these are economic questions .
they concern jobs , accommodation , and public services .
the economists did not manage to answer them , however , and even if they did , their answers did not get any visibility .
the economists did not succeed in explaining that thanks to immigrants , the brits have more jobs , less health centre queues , and more money in education and social security than before .
immigrants , and above all eu immigrants , are net contributors to the british public economy , and their spending creates jobs .
aberdeen real estate fund prepared for brexit with cash
one of the funds was aberdeen asset management , whose real estate investments are managed by a finn pertti vanhanen .
according to him , aberdeen prepared for brexit in time by working out a and b plans .
the preparation for plan b , the victory of those supporting leaving eu , began more closely a couple of weeks before the vote in case the result would be leave .
the concern was that the investors would begin to withdraw their funds away from the market .
usually a real estate fund does not have large liquid assets , but now they could be necessary .
we began to increase cash assets .
when brexit happened on the 23rd , we had 25 per cent of the fund investments either in cash or as liquid assets , says vanhanen about aberdeen ’ s only daily quoted real estate fund the news concerned .
according to vanhanen , the normal level would be 15-20 per cent .
the fund value then was £ 3.5 bn .
usually the company ’ s funds ’ value is about £ 20 bn .
this is the highest amount in nine open-end real estate funds , vanhanen says about all open-end real estate funds in britain .
he estimates that the lowest cash amount in these funds remained at 10 per cent or even lower .
so the real estate funds had very different strategies in preparing for brexit .
funds closing the trade
when the camp supporting eu exit won , europe went mad .
about two weeks following the vote were , however , very quiet on the real estate market , says vanhanen .
then two things happened that changed the situation .
the first was a speech by mark carney , the governor of the bank of england , in which he estimated that brexit can be a big risk for commercial real estate actors .
in addition , the first of the real estate funds , standard life , froze its trade .
these together turned the situation upside down , and highlighted the issue in the headlines of the financial times and the bbc .
the situation was immediately compared to years 2007 and 2008 , says vanhanen .
this made the investors nervous .
the institutional investors stayed calmer , but the private investors were nervous .
the snowball began to roll , and a fund after another had to close its doors .
the aberdeen situation was good because of the collected cash assets , but in the end it , too , had to freeze its trade for six days .
according to vanhanen , they did not exactly close the trade , but changed the pricing downwards .
in practice , the investors were given , according to him , time to consider whether they should withdraw the money in panic .
the message of aberdeen was that if you do not have to withdraw your money now , it is not profitable , because it would result in losses .
that calmed the situation , and the most cancelled their notice .
after that , things have been quite even , and for a couple of weeks now , the market has been very calm , says vanhanen .
he notes that for example aberdeen &apos;s continental europe funds have had no such agitation .
there were a lot of inquiries , though .
excessive attention to real estate funds
according to vanhanen , the stops of real estate funds ’ trading got excessive attention .
the open-end funds the closing affected control about four per cent of the british estates .
the aberdeen stop lasted six days , and the company sold less than 10 of its 80 estates located in london .
some other funds are still closed .
this week , aviva investors warned its investors that it may keep its funds closed until 2017 .
at the moment there is a lot of uncertainty around , and the economy growth predictions have been adjusted downwards , but the situation does not look “ wilder ” relative to aberdeen .
the biggest questions now relate to the future development of british national economy .
despite the uncertainty , the situation has brought even new possibilities to some real estate investors , notes vanhanen .
the pound and dollar rates are lowest in 30 years , and there is a 15 per cent discount on the market compared to pre-brexit vote time period .
a dollar buyer can now buy the same estate for as much as 30 per cent less .
there are a low of willing buyers , says vanhanen .
brexit brought drawbacks to london property market
at two o ’ clock in the morning , the situation did not yet look too good .
but at four , when pertti vanhanen , who is in charge of british real estate fund aberdeen asset management ’ s property investments , woke up to recheck the results of the brexit vote , the situation had changed .
i had to use a swearword .
i realised that we had to soon rely on plan b , vanhanen says in his other home in helsinki .
he headed for work straight away .
london city was already full awake , despite it still being the small hours .
the tv screens in the office , usually muted , were now blaring the news , and the people , usually loud , were completely silent and listening to prime minister david cameron as he stepped in front of the camera in the morning to tell about his resignation .
when the market opened , the terminals were all blinking red .
it was a morning you ’ d never expect to live , vanhanen says .
not just because , despite the turbulence , aberdeen , one of the largest real estate funds in britain , finalised two real estate deals on the day after the brexit vote , at midsummer .
the atmosphere was confused .
the company had been preparing well for this alternative , and in that sense , the situation was kind of calm , vanhanen says .
the brexit vote began a correction
a storm followed the vote .
the pound collapsed , the command of britain was changed .
the market began to anticipate heavy fall in british real estate market , and especially in london .
the decline in london office space was anticipated to be as much as 20 per cent in the following years .
soon a number of british real estate funds began to freeze their trade , one after another .
also aberdeen did that for six days .
now the storm has abated , but there is still uncertainty in the air .
however , it doesn ’ t show on the face of vanhanen , who was spending his final summer vacation days this week in helsinki .
according to him , it is still too early to say much about the consequences of brexit .
so much is still open : how the exit will happen , and how scotland will react to the situation , for example .
there have already been some early information about the development of london real estate market .
the price development data from a real estate service company cbre cover about a third of the market .
according to this data , all the real estate prices in london went down 3,3 per cent from june to july .
in london city office buildings the price drop was 6,1 per cent , lists vanhanen .
the numbers are not so bad , but they are monthly changes .
the monthly index publishing was began in 1987 , and there have been worse numbers only in five months , says vanhanen .
all the drops as big as this coincided with the crisis years of 2007 and 2008 .
this is interesting also because brexit was very quickly compared to lehman fall and the global economy crisis that began from the u.s. real estate market .
vanhanen thinks that this comparison is not quite apposite , because this is a homespun british crisis .
even the atmosphere is different .
there has been no panic selling like then , but more a willingness to sell in order to improve liquidity , vanhanen says .
even the financing is normal .
we could have faced a correction in any case
as a matter of fact , he thinks the price correction is not a miracle , we could have faced that in any case , even without brexit .
according to aberdeen ’ s estimation , the real estate prices in london and other number one cities in the world have been too high already for years .
for two years now , we have said that the city and especially the offices are overpriced , says vanhanen .
therefore the drop began from very high .
there are four reasons , why london prices have climbed up , lists vanhanen .
the british economy has grown strongly , and so has the population in london .
another big trend is that the real estate is the last class of ownership to be globalised , says vanhanen .
there are new market actors from the middle east and asia , and more and more institutions and also private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad .
as a well-known city , london is an easy target .
in addition , the prices have been fed by the low interest level that has driven for example the pension administration organisations to seek profits from new targets .
and , on top of that , loan has been easily available , even though vanhanen says that the leverage has been used clearly less than during the boom before the 2008 crisis .
diversify , diversify
the price ascent in london was stabilised last summer , says vanhanen .
even aberdeen began to lighten their holdings in london , and was indeed a net seller last year .
some kind of a turn was to be expected , and here it is .
what will happen now ?
it depends on how british national economy will develop , says vanhanen .
he does not dare to estimate much , but he says that there will probably be no bounce .
the atmosphere indicates that the going will be downward or level .
vanhanen has already seen several up and down movements , because he has been in the real estate business since 1988 .
and he is still an optimist who believes that work will see us through holes .
if you are well prepared for risks , you have a better position .
he believes in global diversification .
if you have invested too much in one market , you are its victim .
if you have diversified , also the risks have been diversified , says vanhanen .
s group to start registering shopping information more closely
soon the s group will know what you eat , because today the business group declared that it will begin to collect even more precise information about its co-op members ’ purchases .
when so far the information gathered has been of the total amount of a receipt , in the beginning of may the group will hoard it also about the items purchased .
here the s group follows after kesko , since information about items purchased with a k-plussa card has been gathered to kesko ’ s customer register already for a couple of years .
according to k-plus oy managing director ismo riitala , the feedback from the programme has been mainly positive .
item-specific information is gathered with the consent of the customer , and it is used to marketing subject to permission .
the most effective channel is email .
very few customers have forbidden the use of product information , riitala says to taloussanomat .
according to him , kesko will not react to s group ’ s registering change .
kesko classifies its regular customers to ten different groups simply based on groceries alone .
the classification is updated monthly .
the regular customers are also classified according to the number of purchased items and the money used .
the information is used to target marketing to the customer .
item-specific information is gathered only from k-group ’ s own chains .
partners , like for example neste oil , do not give away their information .
lidl finland do not have a customer loyalty programme , and currently they are not planning for one , either .
suomen lähikauppa has its own ykkösbonus customer loyalty programme one can join in a valintatalo , siwa or euromarket .
currently we do not collect information on product level or on product group level , we stay at the level of the receipt ’ s total amount .
so we know where the shopping was done , on what day , and what was the total of the customer ’ s receipt .
we have not gone to k-group ’ s or s group ’ s level , says business manager anu ora .
according to her , there are plans about reforming the customer loyalty programme in the future , but lähikauppa will tell about it later .
however , ora does not promise that they would start registering item information .
an experiment at first
sok ’ s co-op member and customer register has already thus far been relatively comprehensive .
the basic information includes personal data and address information , but also profession , education , mode of living , as well as children &apos;s year of birth , and previous personal data .
also the people living in the same household and their roles have been registered .
information about the purchase date , time , and place , the total amount of shopping and the method of payment has been saved from an s-card purchase .
in addition , the s-bonus partners ’ information has been received from their cash systems .
from the beginning of may , product-level purchase information will be saved in sokos and emotion chains .
instead for the present , s-market , prisma , kodin terra , and abc chains still register the information on a product group level .
the customers have already for quite some time now expressed wishes of a better targeted marketing , says manager of sok ’ s co-op member and partner operations marjaana saarikoski .
s group says it will inform its customers about the change .
they can forbid the use of product-level information to marketing .
the information is stored at the cash registers anyway , whether you want it or not .
those who want can check their saved information on the s group website .
for example cashiers cannot access the information , saarikoski points out .
video : puppy heila is the newest dog reinforcement of the finnish customs - the puppy will be the first explosives dog
a black labrador retriever puppy is energetically sniffing five similar boxes , arranged in a row on the ground at helsinki airport .
in no time at all , it decidedly sit next to the box in the centre .
customs inspector lassi suntio rewards his dog heila by using its favourite toy to play with the dog .
from the box heila sat next to , a can of cartridge cases that smell like gunpowder gas was revealed .
gunpowder gas is the first scent we have been now practising with heila , says suntio , the owner of the puppy .
security situation and e-commerce the main reasons
heila is the customs ’ first dog specialised in searching for arms and explosives , and it will be placed to helsinki airport next year .
if need be , work duties might take heila and suntio also to other points of entry and to harbour .
the airport will , however , be heila ’ s main work place , since the international security situation has changed on account of the serious terrorist attacks in europe .
the attacks in paris and brussels caused the customs to take measures , and after the attacks , control has been strengthened , says supervision director mikko grönberg from the customs .
another main reason for training an arms and explosives dog for the customs , are the postal items that are carried via helsinki airport .
with the grown online sales , there are up to about 40 million postal items carried via helsinki airport every year , and these may include arms equipment and explosive materials ordered from abroad .
in recent years , the customs has discovered about 300 findings related to guns , gun parts , ammunition and explosive materials and their basic materials from the helsinki airport .
heila will work across helsinki airport .
it will examine registered luggage and postal items .
it will be a great advantage at harbours in the future , as it can search large crate areas and mark those areas that require a more thorough investigation , says grönberg .
based on how heila will perform , the customs decides whether they will train more arms and explosives dogs in the future .
grönberg is hopeful about that .
a school at kirkkonummi
puppy heila ’ s training is coordinated by the customs dog training centre , located at kirkkonummi .
suntio and heila will also be trained by the police and finnish defence forces experts .
the police have strong experience on dog training , and the defence forces on explosives .
the customs decide together with other authorities what scents heila is taught to recognise .
heila will be further trained as is necessary , says grönberg .
heila ’ s colleagues at helsinki airport are the customs ’ six drug dogs and the money and drug dog massi .
labrador retriever heila has been chosen from a litter of ten puppies .
when choosing a dog for airport , the selection criteria include activeness , hunting instinct , and calmness , because the dog will deal with guns , explosives , and streams of people .
heila , who lives with suntio , is a close fellow worker of the customs inspector , but also a family member .
you can ’ t go anywhere at home without heila , laughs suntio .
subtle orders click with heila at the first go .
the cameraman from ilta-sanomat loses his camera mic cover to the fast dog , but heila gives the cover that looks like a soft toy back immediately after hearing the command “ let go ” .
hard competition for utility dogs
hella ’ s early training will be ready next year .
there still are placement tests ahead , the next one in october , when it will be assessed whether the training is adequate for the exacting work tasks .
if everything goes according to plans , heila can be seen working at helsinki airport next year .
unfortunately the passengers cannot pet the dog wearing a work west , reminds suntio .
one utility dog ’ s expenses for the customs are about 60,000-70,000 euros per year .
their work age is about seven to eight years , possibly even ten , after which they retire to their owner ’ s care .
the work days can be long , from eight to ten hours , but the active work sections only last from ten minutes to a couple of hours .
there is hard competition at the customs for the ownership of utility dogs .
about 20-30 customs workers applied to be hella &apos;s owner .
the lucky one was suntio , who has not had a work dog before , but he has a long experience with dogs and customs ’ supervision tasks .

voluptuous modern family star causes a stir again : the teenage star &apos;s shorts reveal almost everything
ariel winter , who became known as the good-natured alex dunphy of the comedy series modern family , causes a stir again by displaying her voluptuous curves .
winter was photographed in hollywood this week wearing hot pants that don ’ t leave much to the imagination .
the shorts revealed not only the actress ’ legs , but also her behind .
18-year-old winter has lately attracted attention by changing her style and behaviour to considerably more daring .
the star has published pictures of her posing while wearing very little in the social media , and she has taken several tattoos .
the young woman has also been seen wearing extremely skimpy outfits .
winter , who is on the threshold of adulthood , has lately also published several pictures of herself partying .
if the image isn ’ t visible , you can see it here .
earlier this summer fox news asked some experts , why winter has changed her public image in such a radical way .
back then , the founder and ceo of powerwomentv , amy palmer , suspected that winter is experiencing a &quot; typical hollywood transformation ” from a child star to an adult .
she has been on television for nearly her whole life , and she has grown up in the kardashian era .
she has learnt that the more you show bare skin , the more publicity and attention you get in hollywood , palmer said to fox news adding that this exactly same phenomenon has already been seen countless time before .
winter began in modern family when she was only 11 years old .
the actor has annoyed some of her long-time fans with this change in her image .
it is not difficult to guess , where she will be in ten years , since the downhill is already this steep , one women stated on winter &apos;s instagram account .
some of her fans instead defend the actress , saying that she shouldn ’ t care about the critique .
you look amazing !
it doesn ’ t matter what other people say .
you are an inspiration to many women , a young woman praises .
the japanese prefer finland from the nordic countries - tourists are tempted with auroras : in the autumn it is possible to see a fantastic mirror aurora
the purpose of the campaign is to tempt the japanese to begin their aurora trips already early in the autumn , visit finland says in a press release .
the main attractions for the japanese aurora travel are inari and levi .
the aurora borealis are the main assets for our winter travel , and they are strongly connected with midwinter and snowy landscapes .
there is a good demand for wintery aurora trips to lapland , but now we attempt to increase the sales of autumn trips .
not many know that the aurora season begins already early in the autumn and continues until late in the spring .
during autumn it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora , where the surface of a lake reflects the aurora , thus making the vision twice as fantastic , acting marketing manager anne lind describes in the press release .
the main target group for visit finland ’ s aurora campaign are the wealthy , city-living japanese women between 25 and 35 years , who dream about travelling and new experiences .
they are already interested in finland , its nature and design .
tourists are attracted to finland using for example online advertising .
researchers from aalto university and from universities of turku and tokyo carried out a survey , according to which finland ’ s country image is exceptionally strong and positive among the japanese when compared to other nordic countries .
however , the japanese do wish for clearer unique attractions from finland , and this is where aurora have enormous potential , according to lind .
the overnight stays of japanese tourists have grown significantly more in finland than in other nordic countries .
last year they overnighted in finland over twice more than in sweden , denmark or norway .
from the point of view of finnish travel , the japanese as a target group are interesting , because they spend over 80 million euros in finland .
on average , the japanese spent 183 euros a day in finland , says lind .
britain settle for silver in rugby sevens after fiji masterclass sees them take gold
great britain &apos;s impressive run in the rugby 7s was brought to a crashing halt at the final hurdle by fiji in the final on thursday night when they were comprehensively beaten 43-7 at the deodoro stadium here in rio .
fiji gave a masterclass in handling , off-loading , side-stepping , support play , running lines and brute strength to win gold - their first olympic medal of any colour .
defeat came with the non-too shabby consolation of silver - britain &apos;s third of the day - and they could be proud of their efforts in the inaugural olympic 7s tournament in which they beat new zealand , argentina and south africa along the way .
the bruising beating of the boks , 7-5 in the semi-final earlier in the day , may have come back to bite them in the final .
but , regardless , fiji on this form would have beaten a fit as a fiddle 15-man team .
it may be some consolation to gb - but probably not - that at least one briton will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow : fiji &apos;s head coach is ben ryan , the former england boss from wimbledon .
it has been some journey for gb .
eight years ago , under ryan , they lost every game at the adelaide sevens .
here , they lost just one .
this hammering will hurt but the progress is startling .
fiji started magnificently , bouncing off gb tackles for fun .
it was like running into a series of moving buses for captain tom mitchell and co and the world series champions went 5-0 up when osea kolinisau dived over in the corner .
with four minutes on the clock jerry tuwai added another down the right wing , which was converted .
12-0 and gb had hardly touched the ball .
a superb mitchell tackle stopped the man-mountain leone nakarawa from scoring a third but it was only delaying fiji .
on seven minutes jasa veremalua touched down in the right corner and gb were 17-0 to the bad .
nakarawa added another from the restart and there was still over a minute on the clock ... in the first half .
vatemo ravouvou then burst through some more limp gb tackling and stormed to the line to score .
the conversion made it 29-0 at the break .
it was as if fiji had been born to play 7s , while gb are still learning the trade .
which is pretty much how it is .
gb made wholesale changes at half-time and they plugged the fijian dam ... for all of four minutes , which by first-half standards was good , until josua tuisova went over after some brilliant fijian interplay .
dan norton grabbed a try for gb , touching down in the left corner to make it 36-7 but the game was long gone the way of the south sea islanders whose fans sang , waved flags and danced in the stands .
it was hard not to admire fiji &apos;s whole joyful approach .
mata viliame iced the fijian cake that didn &apos;t need icing with another try in the dying moments .
the whistle went , the fijians embraced and gb hit the turf , thoroughly beaten .
earlier in the day , fiji had beaten japan 20-5 in their semi-final and gb edged south africa in a tight semi-final of one try each - britain &apos;s conversion the difference .
kyle brown put the boks ahead in the first half but dan norton with some dazzling footwork broke the line and scored under the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late tackle from marcus watson , brother of england &apos;s 15-aside team , anthony , secured the win - and ultimately the silver medal .
helen glover and heather stanning inspired to rowing victory by coach &apos;s cancer battle
there will not be a more emotive gold at these games , and that is saying something .
from the first stroke to the last , 220 punishing heaves into history , helen glover and heather stanning found added meaning in their golden moment at the estacio da lagoa .
though they were the two pulling on the oars , there were three voices in that boat , the echo of coach robin williams ever present as they powered to a second successive olympic gold in the women &apos;s pairs , the first females in the annals of british sport to scale such a height .
their dominance was absolute , after all this was their 39th outing unbeaten , again unprecedented .
what we see , two brilliant athletes skating over the surface with the elegance of swans , does not wholly reflect the nature of the triumph .
behind every rowing gold is a battalion of willing hands contributing the incremental gains that make the difference , and no hands were more instrumental than those of a coach who 30 months ago did not know whether he would live to see this day when diagnosed with cancer .
as he said , it was touch and go .
i had bladder cancer which is one of the things they can operate on and they did .
if they don &apos;t it goes everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it alters your outlook a bit .
williams was diagnosed in december 2013 .
the trio were fortunate that he was able to begin his treatment at the start of 2014 out of season , keeping the disruption to a minimum , if that is ever the right expression in circumstances such as these .
i needed to get paid so i had to get better quickly .
it was an incentive .
i was in hospital and i was walking around the ward - 20ft , 30ft 50ft at a time when they were saying a few steps is enough .
that &apos;s how it starts off .
rowing in itself is a journey but that makes it a bit bigger .
in the immediacy of victory their first thoughts were for williams , who had spent a nervy morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to process his own anxieties .
stanning , a captain in the royal artillery regiment with a tour of afghanistan behind her , said &quot; i &apos;ve been an emotional wreck this week , maybe that &apos;s a bit extreme , but it means such a lot . &quot;
it just reiterates how much this means to me , how much me and helen have worked and robin as well .
it &apos;s been a fantastic three years back with helen and robin .
without robin we would be nobody , so a massive thanks to him he &apos;s the best coach in the world .
i couldn &apos;t have asked for a better person to train with , or a better coach .
helen glover and heather stanning haven &apos;t lost a race in five years .
the pair set a punishing rhythm that their rivals could never match .
even in the final 500 metres when the crews from new zealand and denmark began to close , stanning and glover had too much in reserve .
we were very much in the moment .
helen was calling &apos; stay in the process , stay in the process &apos; .
it &apos;s really important not to get carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren &apos;t looking to do anything amazing .
we weren &apos;t looking for fireworks today , we were just looking to do a good row and to go out and win that race , which we did .
the pair will take a year before deciding their futures .
glover has a wedding to attend next month , her own to television adventurer steve backshall .
for now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
i didn &apos;t want to say this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in london it took about six months to realise that i was an olympic champion .
it was all so new and i was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
this feels so much better , &quot; she said .
iceland changes its government that was dirtied in the panama leaks
iceland will have early parliamentary elections in october , but the protesters angered by panama revelations demanded them to organised already in the spring .
the so-called panama papers revealed that several icelandic politicians had evaded taxes using tax havens .
the prime minister sigmundur david gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal , but this was not enough for the demonstrators .
his successor , sigurdur ingi johansson , promised then to organise new parliamentary elections in the autumn .
the election date is now set to be october 29th .
according to analysts , it is difficult to predict the extent of the effect the people ’ s rage from last spring will have on the autumn ’ s election result .
in june &apos;s presidential elections the criticalness towards those in power was clearly seen , and gudni johannesson , who came from outside the politics , was elected president .
trump says he was being sarcastic when claiming obama was the founder of isis
the u.s. republican candidate donald trump retracted his latest stir-causing talks .
he said he was being sarcastic when he claimed that the sitting president barack obama was the founder of terrorist organisation isis , and that the democratic candidate hillary clinton had also abetted in the founding of the organisation .
the democratic party was furious about this and demanded an apology from trump .
anyone willing to sink so low should never be allowed to serve as our commander-in-chief , tweeted clinton .
the mayor of cannes in south of france has banned the use of demure burkini swimsuit favoured by the muslims on the beaches , reports among others a british newspaper guardian .
mayor david lisnard signed off on the ruling stating access to beaches and for swimming is banned to anyone who does not have bathing apparel which respects good customs and secularism .
the ruling also states that beachwear which ostentatiously displays religious affiliation is liable to create risks of disrupting public order in france , which has been a target for terrorist attacks .
in mid-july 85 people were killed and hundreds hurt in nice , when a 31-year old man drove to a crowd celebrating french national holiday .
in the end of july two men , who had been connected to extremist organisation isis , attacked a church in northern france killing a priest who was over 80 years old .
swim water quality in oulu region passed the screening - blue-green algae opacity at pyykösjärvi
the water samples collected from the official beaches in oulu region meet the quality demands set for swim water .
pyykösjärvi beach is the only one with observed blue-green algae .
the environmental office of oulu region took water samples during tuesday and wednesday from the nine eu beaches and 30 other public beaches in oulu region .
with the exception of meriniemi beach , all the other beaches ’ e.coli and intestinal enterococcus bacteria levels in swim waters were below the action limits set in the decrees by ministry of social affairs and health .
the e.coli and intestinal enterococcus bacteria levels at meriniemi beach were confirmed on wednesday , when the bacteria levels had declined and were under the action limits .
blue-green algae opacity found from pyykösjärvi beach does not in itself make the water unsuitable for swimming , but if the conditions are favourable , the situation can develop to algal blooms quite fast , and then there will be blue-green algae mass sheets formed on the water surface .
the environmental office will follow up the situation with more frequent checks .
if the blue-green algae opacity turns into algal blooms , the issue will be reported separately also on the beach notice board .
you can check the swim water samples ’ results here .
mtk ’ s hakkarainen on the forest gift deduction : over 80 percent of the forest owners outside
the forest gift deduction is one of the tax changes in the next year ’ s budget proposal by the ministry of finance .
a tax deduction to the income tax law is proposed . the deduction would be granted on the basis of forest property succession gift tax .
in the proposal by the ministry of finance , this forest gift deduction has four goals : to promote generation changes in forest holdings , to make forest owners ’ age structure younger , to increase the holding sizes , and to increase the wood supply .
the goal of the ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry .
a forest owner would make the deduction from the pure income from forest capital .
generally speaking , the idea of doing a tool such as this to promote forest properties ’ generational change is good , commented the forestry director juha hakkarainen of the central union of agricultural producers and forest owners ( mtk ) .
however , hakkarainen did find points of criticism from the tax change proposal .
the forest gift deduction is proposed to be made from the pure capital income of the forest owner .
it is capital income from which all the other deductions have been deducted .
according to mtk and hakkarainen , the effectiveness of the tax deduction would be greater , if the deduction could be made straight from the wood sales proceeds .
the starting point for the mof proposal is that by making the deduction from the forestry &apos;s pure capital income , it is possible to prevent forestry capital income losses based on the deduction that then would be deducted elsewhere in taxation .
in this case a person would get a tax benefit even without selling wood .
the calculation model is unnecessarily complicated .
an average forest owner is not able to piece it together , says hakkarainen .
in addition , he says , the model only affects a small part of forest owners .
the proposed limit of tax deduction that is tied to the forest ’ s profits is 40,000 euros .
hakkarainen thinks this is too high .
according to him , as such it will eliminate 82 per cent of finnish forest owners away from the reduction sphere .
this model would have an effect on about 10 per cent of forest owners , he says .
mof sees the limit as supporting the goal of increasing holding sizes .
according to hakkarainen , forest gift deduction has been talked about for decades .
the reason behind it is the aging of forest owners .
according to mtk , at the moment , the average age of forest owners is over 60 years , and about half of forest owners are pensioners .
a heavy hailstorm surprised the motorists at himanka - two cars fell into a ditch and collided with each other
a peculiar rear-end collision happened at kalajoki ’ s himanka on friday morning .
according to the rescue department , two cars that were driving one after another fell into a ditch , after which the car driving behind collided with the rear end of the car driving in front .
according to the fire master on duty , harri pyyhtiä , the falling is suspected to be caused by a heavy hailstorm .
the car that was driving behind had two persons in it , and they both were taken to hospital .
there is no specific information about their injuries .
the driver of the car that drove in front was not injured .
the accident happened on the main road number 8 , a few kilometres from himanka towards kalajoki .
finnish study can help in improving the effect of cancer treatments
the new study results from researchers in university of turku can help in developing more effective cancer treatments .
the observations by academy of finland researcher johanna ivaska ’ s research group show that the hardness of a cancer tumour increases the cancer malignancy .
many human tissues , like breast tissue , are very soft , and the tissue cells grow as usual in an environment such as this .
according to ivaska , it was possible to stop the cancer growth in a laboratory environment by returning the tissue surrounding the cancer to correspond to normal , soft tissue .
in the future it may be possible to improve medical cancer treatments ’ effectiveness by focussing on the communication between cells and surrounding tissue in addition to cancer cells in treatments .
the study results have been published 4 august in a prestigious cellular biology publication , nature communications .
the hearing of the muhos foster home homicide continues at the court of appeal , the prosecutor demands a homicide sentence also to the other offender .
the hearing of the muhos foster home case continues at the court of appeal for both sentenced persons .
in june , two young men were sentenced to prison for a foster home homicide in muhos .
one got 8 years and 4 months for manslaughter and for aggravated robbery as a young person , among other things .
the other one ’ s sentence is 12 years for murder as a young person and for aggravated robbery .
the one sentenced for manslaughter was sentenced also for aggravated endangering of road safety as a young person , and unlawful driving of a vehicle as a young person .
the prosecutor , complainants , and the man with the more severe sentence complained about the district court ’ s sentence .
the prosecutor demands that the man with the lighter sentenced should also be sentenced 12 years in prison for murder as a young person .
both were compos mentis at the time of the crime
according to the district court , in last july the two 17-year old young men killed a man who worked as a supervisor at a foster home under a reformatory school .
according to the court ’ s rationale for the sentence , the 17-year old who was sentenced for murder attacked the supervisor from behind , as this was sitting on the living room sofa .
the supervisor managed to disentangle himself from the hold , leading the young person to his room , when the other of young person hit him with a vacuum cleaner pipe .
the supervisor was also strangled with a cord , hit , and kicked to the head .
according to the mental examination , both of the condemned were of sound mind in the time of the crime .
according to the court , the youth had planned an escape from the foster home at least since the previous day .
greenland shark is the longest-living vertebrate in the world , does not reproduce until its 156 years old
the longest-living vertebrate in the world was confirmed to be the greenland shark , stated a study published by science .
greenland shark , also known as grey shark , swims in the north atlantic , like around greenland , and can live to be up to 400 years old .
the female does not reproduce until its 156 years old .
greenland shark ’ s life span is lengthened by the fact it grows only about 1 centimetre a year .
only a certain clam species is known to live longer than the greenland shark .
the researchers revealed the age with radiocarbon dating .
some of the sharks had radioactive traces because of the nuclear tests done in the 1950s .
based on those , the researchers were able to estimate the sharks ’ age .
the oldest was estimated to be 392 years , however the variation can be as much as plus or minus 120 years .
donald trump as an economic expert - kansan uutiset
donald trump ’ s america doesn ’ t need the rest of the world .
as much as a third of all the state ’ s tax revenue would be lost , if the change to corporate taxes that donald trump pushes is implemented .
the tax revenues would be reduced also with the tax concessions that benefit especially the richest ones .
presenting his tax programme on monday in detroit , trump described it as revolutionary .
corporate tax would decrease from 35 per cent to 15 per cent .
a truly enormous sum would be left uncollected , 1000 billion dollars per year .
the highest income tax percentage is now 39,6 , and 33 after the reduction trump has proposed .
inheritance tax would be completely waived .
trump blamed the state for regulating the economy too much , and for forcing small companies into bankruptcy .
the hurriedly decided environmental standards must be remake , and energy regulations must be rescinded .
barack obama ’ s health care reform must be reconsidered .
“ experts instead of bureaucrats ” should be appointed to the administration .
a “ disastrous ” trade policy is one of the biggest reasons to united states ’ problems according to trump .
free trade agreements would be cancelled .
a penalty tax of 45 per cent would be slapped on chinese imports , and 35 per cent on mexican imports .
we offer a new future .
americanism , not globalism , will be our credo , trump declared .
donald trump ’ s america doesn ’ t need the rest of the world :
there will be american cars driving on the streets , american planes connecting cities , american ships to patrol on seas , american steel building new skyscrapers everywhere in the country .
contrary to his customs , trump faithfully read through the speech written by assistants , even despite it being interrupted 14 times by well organised protests .
economists - also those near republicans - see trump &apos;s programme as something that will lead the united states to a deep , economic recession .
hillary clinton published her own programme early on friday finnish time .
a tidal wave from the past - kansan uutiset
the sea churns fatefully , but the true tidal wave hits among madrid ’ s crowds - the day of reckoning with the past can begin .
that is the core of the story in pedro almodóvar ’ s newest .
the previous film almodóvar directed , i ’ m so excited ( 2013 ) , was a somewhat campy and rather racy satirical comedy , the one preceding that , the skin i live in ( 2011 ) , one of the culminations of the spanish virtuoso ’ s career .
as to its level , julieta ( 2016 ) is placed somewhere in between those two works .
it is conventionally serene love , relationship and family drama , in the centre of which is a mother-daughter relationship .
the story is a simple one , and largely told in flashbacks .
life seems to be going well for the middle-aged title character ( emma suarez ) , but then all threatens to fall apart .
in the wake of a random encounter , a new partner ( dario grandinetti ) is astonished all the way to the final stages of the film .
in the form of a flashback and a long letter , julieta recounts her life story to her grownup daughter .
she begins from the time before the daughter was born , from the moments she met the future father of the girl ( daniel grao ) .
at the same time , adraina ugarte , who is familiar from the tv series the time in between ( 2013-2014 ) , rises to the role of the other leading lady : julieta as a young teacher .
julieta ’ s aging has been realised in a way that can be considered as clumsy , but i myself would say that it is kind of funny and literally done in one fell swoop .
julieta has long distance to the sparkling , including humour , that so often characterises almodóvar ’ s films .
it is evenly acted , composed , containing good music here and there , and rather melancholic film that has ingredients for an elegy the way it is .
instead the visual saturation that is typical for the spanish director is still extant , and it exists in a way it slowly begins to stick out more as a pure technicality than a functional dramatic effect .
the characters in the film are tested by illnesses , deaths , or sudden losses for no particular reason , but the surface remains decorative .
this is true especially when it comes to costumes : in the case of the titular character the costumes change from one scene to another , and the same is true for the flamboyant earrings .
almodóvar is particular in these things , but the main thing , the set-ups of each scene , doesn ’ t really improve by this .
as it is mechanically repeated , the impression is detached and slightly spiritless .
almodóvar has written the script based on three short stories by alice munro , a canadian who received the nobel prize for literature in 2013 .
the short stories have been published in the book runaway : stories .
almodóvar has invested in the dialogue , and the result is a slightly monotonous literary literature cinematisation .
the ingredients for by far emotionally more robust a drama were there , so great are the things discussed in the film ’ s thematic material , especially gnawing guilt .
directed and manuscript by : pedro almodóvar .
based on three short stories by alice munro .
starring : emma suarez , adriana ugarte , rossy de palma , daniel grao , dario grandinetti .
the film will be released on august 12 .
the government attempts a vote trick - kansan uutiset
there will be no new cuts , the ministers keep on saying , so that the finns party would not completely collapse .
though there are plenty of cuts decided in spring that are made .
there will be no new cuts .
the already decided cuts of 4 billion are enough .
this is what the prime minister juha sipilä ( centre ) and the minister of finance petteri orpo ( coalition ) assure before the government budget session .
this holds true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the mof ’ s proposal , since the social security cuts were decided already in the spending limits session of spring .
child benefit , national pension , basic unemployment security , and nearly all the other benefits tied to national pension index are being cut 0.85 per cent .
the duration of earnings-related unemployment security will shorten from 500 days to 400 days .
the education cuts continue .
the municipal elections are haunting
why are the ministers so eager to emphasise the very fact that there will be no new cuts on top of these ?
because next year is an election year .
the municipal elections are in april , and they , not the polls , are the most important thermometer of the electoral term .
it has been seen already before that the government parties ’ diverging municipal election results ruin the government atmosphere for a long time .
however , the polls show that there is a beating waiting the government party finns , even though its previous election result , 12.3 per cent , was modest compared to general election .
four years ago the finns party got 752 new municipal councillors , most of whom will see the cost of working in a right-wing government realised next spring .
the lifeline of this government of about three equal-sized parties hinges on whether the finns party has the nerve .
now it hasn ’ t , but over half of the party ’ s voters were fed up with the government policies already during the first year .
the first signs of the party ’ s parliamentary group ’ s state of turbulence have surfaced .
‘ there will be no new cuts ’ rhetoric is used firstly to obscure the fact that next year there will be harsh cuts , and secondly to soften the blow that is coming to the finns party .
major cuts in 2018 ?
in a year everything will most likely be different - if sipilä ’ s government is still standing .
the government ’ s goal is to break the incurring of debts during this parliamentary term , but in petteri orpo ’ s budget proposal there is 5.9 billion euros more debt contracted next year than this year .
after the municipal elections , the government has two options .
the first is to put their hands up already halfway through the electoral term and to admit that the government is unable to follow their own program : the indebtedness is not broken or even slowed down .
the second is to hold on to their program .
that means even harder cuts on top of the previous ones in the 2017 government budget session .
the budget would be forced at least close to a balance during 2018 , and then , in the spring , it would be just accepting whatever is coming in the general elections .
with these actions , the indebtedness will not be broken .
it is completely obvious that the current actions will not be enough to break the indebtedness , no matter how much juha sipilä attempts to whip up a positive atmosphere .
the graphs presented by the state secretary martti hetemäki in the budgetary press conference prove it indisputably :
the world economy ’ s growth predictions have , again and again , turned out to be overly positive , so there will be no support from international economy .
finnish national economy has not risen much since the crash in 2008 , except temporarily during the stimulus policy in the beginning of the 2010s .
during this decade , unemployment has increased 35 per cent and is prolonged from 34 to 35 weeks on average .
unemployment now costs 3 billion euros more annually than it did in 2008 .
the graphs presented by hetemäki show that the general government debt that crossed 60 per cent limit in 2014 will grow to 70 per cent halfway through next decade .
what is responsible ?
in spring 2015 , the debt recovery proposed by the left alliance was rejected , because it was considered to be irresponsible .
next year the maintenance of unemployment costs about 6 billion euros , the sum that is practically fully covered by contracting new debt .
this is the centre party ’ s , the coalition party ’ s , and the finns party ’ s idea of what is responsible .
a survey : people want to leave a lot of tasks to municipalities
three out of four thinks that organising children ’ s day care , youth work , and physical education should be a municipality ’ s responsibilities , reveals a study by kaks - kunnallisalan kehittämissäätiö ( the foundation for municipal development ) .
a clear majority of the people shifts the responsibility on to a single municipality also when it comes to libraries , culture , adult education centres , supervision of building , upper secondary school education , and waste management .
as for the province , the clearest hoped-for tasks are regional land use planning , specialised health care , vocational education , polytechnics , and institutional care for mentally disabled .
none of tasks that are municipalities ’ responsibilities should be transferred to the state .
under-age drunken driver ran away from the police after a chase
a 16-year old motorcyclist from joensuu tried to escape from a patrol in ilomantsintie , joensuu , on friday night around half past twelve .
the patrol tried to stop the motorcyclist who rode without lights , but the young men tried to escape the police riding with an excessive speed .
the chase continued to sonkajanrannantie , where it further proceeded to sorronahontie and to a smaller forest road , where the motorcycle drifted out of the road .
even after this the young man ran away , but the police was quicker and caught the runaway .
the driver ’ s breathalyser test showed a permillage of 0,75 .
he also did not have a driver ’ s licence that would have permitted to drive on a motorcycle .
the incident is being investigated as aggravated endangering of road safety , among other things .
a lorry with a load of rocks toppled over into a ditch
a lorry with a load of rocks toppled over into a ditch on kaavintie , polvijärvi , on thursday evening around 9.15 pm .
the lorry had drifted out of the road on a left curve , and toppled over into a ditch .
the rescue department lifted the injured driver away from the toppled lorry via a door above it together with the rescue helicopter personnel and the paramedics .
lifting the vehicle was left to the car &apos;s owner .
hydraulic oil was leaking from the lorry to the road , and the rescue department absorbed it with turf .
the police is investigating the cause of the accident .
an elderly female went missing this afternoon in ilmajoki
an 87-year old woman has been missing since this afternoon in lahdenkylä , ilmajoki , in southern ostrobothnia .
the police is looking for a good-postured woman of about 165 cm tall and slim , with white hair reaching below the chin .
all observations and hints about the missing person ’ s movements are asked to report to the ostrobothnia situation centre hotline at 0295440513 .
ingredients for a disaster - see the picture gallery of the parafest destruction
a downburst knocked over parafest festival ’ s tents and caused massive destruction .
the president of joensuu ’ s parafestyhdistys , arto pippuri , estimated that the festival will recover financially , and the event can be arranged also next year .
the last parafest artist , kalle salonen , performed in the end of friday evening on the market stage .
on saturday the programme will continue at 1 pm with performances in the town theatre ’ s facilities .
a parafest exhibition is held at art centre ahjo between 1 and 3 pm .
the programme will be arranged as planned .
a downburst emanates in a thunder cloud , when rain water and its weight start a downward air flow .
the changes of state of the thunder cloud ’ s water bind warmth , and this is how the descending air mass gets cooler and its velocity accelerates .
the finnish meteorological institute says that there are several downbursts in finland during the summer .
it is difficult to predict a downburst ’ s route .
a downburst hit joensuu ’ s art museum ’ s backyard that was the scene for parafest on friday afternoon before five .
three tents were knocked down , with a total of about 200 people inside them .
four people were slightly injured in the accident .
among these people was one child , who was taken to further examinations slightly hurt .
air pollution makes londoners older
according to a study , londoners ’ skin ages faster than normal .
the reason for skin aging is air pollution .
evening standard reports of a british study .
british skincare firm caci analysed levels of the most toxic tiny particulates in london to investigate their impact on the skin .
the results show that the skin of many senior london citizens will be the equivalent of two-and-a-half years older than that of someone in the countryside .
this skin-aging fine particles are ultra-fine pollution dust that comes from traffic ’ s fuel fumes .
the same particles also cause respiratory diseases that , according to evening standard , contribute to the deaths of nearly 9,500 londoners every year .
it has been discovered in studies that the particles are small enough to penetrate the skin ’ s outer layer .
caci ’ s study found that premature ageing is a risk especially to those londoners who commute by walking near busy roads .
inhabitants of london can attempt to protect from air pollution for example with different masks , but a more practical solution is regular cleansing .
tractor ’ s brakes gave out - pushed a man standing in front of the machine
the man had moved rocks on his yard using a tractor .
when he got off the tractor and walked in front of it , the tractor ’ s brakes gave out and it slowly ran over the man .
the man did not got stuck under it , but the tractor did manage to knock the man so hard that he was badly hurt and was taken to the central hospital for further examinations .
the tractor did not run any further , because it hit the rocks that were in front of it .
riento has a new impetus for the coming season
joensuu-based liiga-riento who play in the finland volleyball league have the best starting point in ages to the league that begins in october .
the team has been together for nearly three weeks now .
the common language will be certainly found better than during last seasons , when the beginning of the series have been grim to riento .
jani säisä , who continues as riento ’ s main coach , praises the new team as energetic and consistent .
from the foreign trio , middle blocker fred musoni begins his second season in riento .
the new faces are 23-year olds murangwa nelson and hiago garchet .
nelson , who has been in the rwanda national team , is a 205 cm tall opposite hitter .
garchet is correspondingly a setter , and the brazilian is 198 cm tall .

i got interested , and here we are now , says 48-year old jumppanen .
jumppanen was born in 1967 in the town of elizabeth near new york .
the family moved to helsinki when the girl was one year old .
in 1987 , jumppanen got in to joensuu university to study computer science .
when i came to joensuu , there was no national level in floorball yet .
floorball was played as a hobby in the university .
i used to play basketball in kataja , and then later finnish national league ice hockey in jokipojat , jumppanen remembers .
jumppanen played floorball in the finnish national league in 1991-92 in the university ’ s club , and the following next year was spent in josba .
while playing , she also coached the clubs a girls to a championship .
her career in the women ’ s national league culminated in silver in 1995 .
altogether jumppanen played 10 seasons in the finnish national league for women , earning a point total of 51 + 34 = 85 in 169 matches .
her final national league level season was 2001-2002 .
perttu puska and tatu väänänen nominated for the national team
perttu puska , originally from a joensuu floorball team josba , and tatu väänänen from eno , were appointed to the finnish national team that play in eft tournament in brno , czech republic , on 6.-8 . november .
25-year old perttu puska , a forward in helsinki ’ s erä , has before this played in six men &apos;s national matches , in which he has gathered a point total of 9 + 4 = 13 .
32-year old tatu väänänen , a defender in the swiss wiler-ersigen , has recovered from a thigh injury , and is part of the national team ’ s permanent fixture with experience from 117 national matches .
also veteran player mika kohonen from seinäjoen peliveljet was appointed to the national team . the last time he was seen wearing team finland ’ s colours was in the world championships last december .
the main coach of the floorball team is petri kettunen from kontionlahti .
beach volley virtuoso essi hasu ’ s circle closes in kouvola - finnish championship gold missing from the display cabinet
essi hasu is about finish her career as a beach volley player , at least temporarily , after the current season .
the finnish championships in beach volley are settled during the weekend in kouvola ’ s urheilupuisto .
in the course of three days , the medal games will be played in both adult and youth categories .
six of the ranking ’ s best pairs from each category qualify for the championship tournament that is arranged by kouvolan lentopalloilijat and suomen lentopalloliitto .
originally from elimäen nmky , essi hasu represents local colour in the tournament . she has been one of the top beach volley player in finland for already several years .
hasu , who currently lives in helsinki , eagerly awaits for games in front of a familiar crowd .
i hope as many as possible can make it to the stands this weekend .
i ’ m sure the arena at the baseball stadium is going to be great .
i haven ’ t played in adult categories that often in kouvola , so it is great to play in the finals in my own home area , says hasu feeling sentimental .
it was the kouvola region that ignited the spark for sports in hasu , and gave a good start in a great hobby .
i have many memories from the childhood .
i started playing volleyball in elimäen nmky &apos;s e girls when i was nine .
the main thing i remember is the oversized game jersey , the knee pads rolling around the ankles , and the amazing cheers and choreographies after we scored , recalls hasu .
in a small place , a sports club was a tight community where everyone knew each other .
the team spirit created an atmosphere , where it was nice to play in .
everyone ’ s families were strongly involved in the activities - a team mate ’ s father was our couch , and my mother was a long-time president of the club .
for essi hasu , beach volley was a natural choice to counterbalance indoor volleyball already when she was a junior .
beach volley has been played at käyrälampi beach already in the 1990s .
activity at the käyski has always been active .
i went there myself , too , to see the junior &apos;s finnish championships competitions thinking that some day i would be playing there myself .
now this dream comes true , when this weekend hasu is playing in the fc finals together with anniina parkkinen from pieksämäki .
the duo , ranked second in the tournament after riikka lehtonen and taru lahti , has a clear goal .
our realistic goal is a medal .
we still don ’ t have an fc gold in the display cabinet , hasu adds mysteriously .
the weekend ’ s performance in kouvola might be the last one for hasu in front of a familiar crowd .
in the beginning of september , there will be new challenges waiting with her civilian work .
yes , my international career will be over after kisakallio tournament .
anyway i plan to hang my barefoot shoes up at least temporarily , plans hasu .

salomon koli bravely began as an agricultural entrepreneur
agriculture as an enterprise means taking risks , sweat , and drive .
a young farmer , 25-years old salomon koli became a farmer , because he believes in positive future also at the countryside .
soon two years ago koli , together with his younger brother valtteri koli , became continuators of his home farm .
their father , markus koli , helps and advises the brothers based on his own experience .
beginning as an agricultural entrepreneur meant contracting debt and making the farm size larger , so that it would be possible to earn one ’ s bread from farming .
ever since i was a little boy , this has been my thing .
i &apos;ve always liked busying myself around the farm , and now that i started as an entrepreneur myself , it ’ s all in .
if you begin something , i think you should do it in earnest and properly .
in 2013 we set out to build a cow shed , and in the beginning even the bank was not enthusiastic about it .
i myself was just simply all in with the project , and i &apos;ve given it my everything , says salomon koli adding that he wouldn ’ t have entered into this project , if he didn ’ t have faith in producing clean finnish food , and in that everything will turn out to be fine .
salomon koli , who raises beef cattle , has a goal of investing in even bigger a cowshed .
the work has paid off , because salomon koli is in the top ten of the young food producer competition organised by newspaper maaseudun tulevaisuus .
at the moment he is competing for the possible victory .
you can vote for salomon on the newspaper ’ s website until 21 . august .

snapchat &quot; anime &quot; effect is criticized as asian caricature
snapchat says this filter is inspired by anime , but some observers say it &apos;s racially insensitive .
with its lens tool , snapchat allows some 150 million daily users to alter reality and play with identity in ways that border on the absurd .
you can turn yourself into a pineapple , a dog or a character befitting a roy lichtenstein painting .
the lenses are blunt , feature-warping tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day .
any missteps quickly enter the public record .
snapchat lenses have drawn criticism in the past with accusations that the app was promoting blackface or encouraging whitened skin tones as an ideal of beauty .
so when it pushed a lens to some users this week that gave them slanted eyes , distorted teeth and puffy cheeks , some critics called it a racist caricature of asian people - &quot; yellowface . &quot;
and they wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity .
the news and the outrage went wide on wednesday , with reports by the verge and motherboard , a day after snapchat said it had dismantled the feature .
the company offered an explanation : the lens was meant as homage to anime characters , not as a caricature of asian people .
but for observers who have experienced racism , the lens reminded them of hurtful stereotypes in action .
others roundly rejected the anime comparison .
in an email , grace sparapani , a korean american art student whose tweet about the photos was widely shared , said that the lens was &quot; hurtful and uncomfortable to say the least . &quot;
she added that &quot; it &apos;s hard to argue with the side by side comparison of the very gross asian caricature and the filter &apos;s effects .
it shows that the filter isn &apos;t just yellowface , but yellowface taken to its derogatory extreme .
snapchat is not the only company to cross these cultural tripwires .
american culture seems involved in an endless struggle over diversity and inclusion , from corporate boardrooms to hollywood and the devices we all carry in our hands .
and snapchat &apos;s huge audience of younger people - who are more racially diverse than their older counterparts - might mean that they are even more likely to expect sensitivity .
when one of snapchat &apos;s lenses creates an image that is insulting to a user , 25-year-old katie zhu said in an interview on thursday , &quot; it &apos;s much harder for these types of things to go unnoticed like they did before . &quot;
on thursday , ms. zhu , a product manager and engineer who works for medium , decided to delete her snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same .
in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said she believed that the race-related controversies reflected a lack of diversity in hiring practices at snapchat .
ms. zhu criticized the company &apos;s mostly white , all-male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag : # deletesnapchat .
&quot; it &apos;s either that they had no diverse representation of people of color on their staff to the point where they &apos;re able to make decisions like this , &quot; ms. zhu , who is chinese-american , said , &quot; or they do have some people of color who are working there , but they &apos;re not on positions where they feel safe or comfortable to speak up . &quot;
other observers share her view , a complaint that snapchat has left largely unanswered .
the company does not release figures about diversity on its staff , noting its status as a private company .
on thursday , snapchat declined to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff , but according to a spokesman , the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and on driving inclusion efforts internally .
for her part , ms. zhu said she would keep her snapchat account closed , adding , &quot; i wonder if they actually need more users like us to be able to say that this is not o.k. &quot;
military officials distorted isis intelligence , congressional panel says
officials from the united states central command altered intelligence reports to portray a more optimistic picture of the war against the islamic state in iraq and syria than events on the ground warranted , a congressional panel said in a report issued thursday .
the interim report , from a task force established by the republican chairmen of the house armed services committee , intelligence committee and defense appropriations subcommittee , found &quot; widespread dissatisfaction &quot; among central command intelligence analysts , who said superiors were doctoring their assessments of american efforts to defeat the islamic state .
central command , known as centcom , is the military headquarters in tampa , fla . , that oversees american military operations across the middle east and central asia .
&quot; intelligence products approved by senior centcom leaders typically provided a more positive depiction of u.s. antiterrorism efforts than was warranted by facts on the ground and were consistently more positive than analysis produced by other elements of the intelligence community , &quot; a news release about the report said .
&quot; what happened at centcom is unacceptable - our war fighters suffer when bad analysis is presented to senior policy makers , &quot; said representative ken calvert , republican of california .
the leadership failures at centcom reach to the very top of the organization .
the 10-page report detailed persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in central command &apos;s description and analysis of american efforts to train iraqi forces .
although it offers no definitive evidence that senior obama administration officials ordered the reports to be doctored , it describes analysts as feeling as though they were under pressure from centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the islamic state , also known as isis or isil .
&quot; throughout the first half of 2015 , many central command press releases , statements and congressional testimonies were significantly more positive than actual events , &quot; the report said .
for example , a centcom official stated publicly that a major military assault to take back mosul could begin as early as april or may 2015 .
mosul , iraq &apos;s second-largest city , remains under the control of the islamic state .
&quot; after months of investigation , this much is very clear , &quot; representative mike pompeo , republican of kansas , said in a statement .
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the united states central command &apos;s most senior intelligence leaders manipulated the command &apos;s intelligence products to downplay the threat from isis in iraq .
republicans created the task force after learning that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence about the islamic state was being manipulated .
the report released thursday is to be followed up by more extensive findings as the investigation continues .
there is an additional , ongoing investigation of centcom intelligence by the department of defense inspector general .
democratic members of the house intelligence committee released their own findings on thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the republican task force .
&quot; between 2014 and 2015 , centcom created an overly insular process for producing intelligence assessments on isil and iraqi security forces , &quot; representative adam b. schiff , the committee &apos;s top democrat , said in a statement .
this process , mr. schiff said , &quot; stalled the release of intelligence products , &quot; hurt morale among analysts and &quot; insufficiently accommodated dissenting views . &quot;
but mr. schiff and the democrats said they found no evidence that the white house tried to pressure centcom analysts to fit their conclusions to a &quot; preset or political narrative . &quot;
the preliminary results of the congressional investigation were reported tuesday by the daily beast .
last august , the new york times reported the existence of the pentagon inspector general investigation , opened after complaints by centcom analysts .
lt. cmdr. patrick evans , a pentagon spokesman , said in a statement that the defense department would not comment on the congressional report while the inspector general &apos;s investigation continued .
but he said that &quot; experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data , and the intelligence community and department of defense welcome healthy dialogue on these vital national security topics . &quot;
the investigation has repercussions beyond the question of whether the american-led bombing campaign in iraq and syria is succeeding ( an assertion now made by a growing number of defense officials ) .
but last year &apos;s allegations called into question how much president obama could rely on central command for honest assessments of military operations in iraq , afghanistan , libya and other crisis spots .
the critiques on the islamic state intelligence mirror disputes of more than a decade ago , when a centcom intelligence analyst , gregory hooker , wrote a research paper saying that the administration of president george w. bush , over many analysts &quot; objections , advocated a small force in iraq and spent little time thinking about what would follow the 2003 invasion .
mr. hooker also played a key part in the insurrection over the islamic state intelligence .
last year , officials said , mr. hooker &apos;s team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary , airstrikes against islamic state-held refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group &apos;s finances because it had built makeshift refineries to sell oil on the black market .
but the finding was not distributed outside central command , the times reported in september .
centcom &apos;s commander then , gen. lloyd j. austin iii , came under criticism last year after senate testimony viewed by many lawmakers as being an overly positive assessment of the war .
general austin retired in april and was replaced at central command by gen. joseph l. votel .
u.s. wins 4th straight in women &apos;s field hockey , setting up showdown with britain
one day after scoring three goals in a 6-1 victory over japan , katie bam scored the first two goals for the united states women &apos;s field hockey team on thursday as the americans defeated india , 3-0 .
five goals in two games should be a memorable feat , but bam , 27 , said she was not sure if she had ever done the same thing .
&quot; i have no clue , &quot; she said .
i &apos;m not really one of those people who keeps track of their goals .
here is what she does know : the americans are 4-0 in the olympic tournament and are tied for first place in their group with britain , which remained unbeaten after defeating japan , 2-0 , on thursday .
britain and the united states will meet on saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have qualified for the quarter finals , and the game will decide who finishes first in their six-team bracket and who finishes second .
the first-place finisher will avoid the powerful dutch , the leaders of the other bracket , for a bit longer when the quarter finals begin .
however saturday &apos;s game turns out , the americans have created a stir with their surprising run here , four years after finishing last among 12 teams at the london games .
bam was on that team .
she grew up in blue bell , pa . , first picked up a field hockey stick when she was 3 ( her twin older sisters played the sport at drexel ) and joined the national team when she was 16 , becoming its youngest player ever .
she missed out on the 2008 olympics when she did not make the cut for the final roster .
then came 2012 , when nothing much went right for her and her teammates .
the next year , craig parnham , an englishman , was named the coach , and things began to change .
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change , a physical change , &quot; bam said .
we didn &apos;t have the work rate in london that we have now .
we &apos;ve made a complete turnaround .
on thursday night , bam opened the scoring in the first half with a backhand shot from close in .
india had come into the game without a victory in the tournament , but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until late in the third period , when bam took charge .
she made a long run with the ball down the left side of the field , then curled into the middle and whipped the ball into the goal to give the americans a 2-0 lead .
melissa gonzalez added the final goal midway through the fourth period .
the shutout was the first of the tournament for the united states goalie , jackie briggs , who had allowed one goal in each of the first three victories .
she is on a roll .
so is bam .
&quot; we &apos;re in a good place right now , &quot; parnham said , but just how good it is will depend on the result of saturday &apos;s game .
amid the fury of the olympics , the zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , whatever time it is , it is the olympics .
the events in rio de janeiro feel constant and inescapable , a furious relay of competition and striving .
it is as if the olympic torch itself were a flaming baton , passed from archer to swimmer to gymnast to triathlete .
you can &apos;t turn on a television , read a newspaper or listen in on your neighbor &apos;s conversation in a coffee-shop line without hearing about simone biles , katie ledecky or the feud between michael phelps and chad le clos .
and then there is logan dooley .
mr. dooley , a first-time olympian and a dimpled heartthrob in the making , may well be among those household names being showcased in prime time , buoyed by sponsorships and feel-good tv commercials , if he were a swimmer , a gymnast or even a fencer .
but mr. dooley , 28 , of lake forest , calif . , is competing for the gold in olympic trampoline .
the olympic flame does not illuminate each event equally .
further from the center , partly in shadow , are those sports not universally acknowledged : air-pistol shooting , archery , badminton , taekwondo .
we will always have the breaststroke , and long may it reign .
but if i may make a modest case for my particular favorite , let me call attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
though trampoline has been an olympic event since 2000 , when it debuted at the sydney games , it has spent the intervening 16 years so barely acknowledged that many i surveyed did not realize it was an olympic sport at all .
this may be a regional ignorance .
despite sending athletes to compete , the united states has never won a medal in trampoline and did not have an athlete advance to the finals until 2012 .
the chinese and the russians tend to split the prizes for the men , and the chinese and the canadians for the women .
dong dong of china and rosie maclennan of canada will be defending their london gold medals this year .
but there is an underdog charm to trampoline , in part because it sounds , to the unenlightened ear , fitter for clown college than the olympics .
here i should confess that i am no expert , just an earthbound enthusiast .
it does have comic potential - the cartoon quaver of its never-ending bounce - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving , the two sports it essentially combines .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; derives from the spanish el trampolín , meaning &quot; diving board . &quot;
aspiring champions jump on a giant trampoline , shooting up to nearly 30 feet in the air , and are called upon to perform a series of tumbling moves ( twists , pikes and somersaults ) before eventually landing on their feet .
they are judged on execution , difficulty and &quot; flight time , &quot; according to the official olympic program .
thirty-two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in rio .
the most common olympic vector is straight ahead .
medal hopefuls must go farther , faster , up and over , in their quest for gold , sometimes to the finish , other times back and forth up and down the court .
they are chasing not only the finish line or the starting wall but also , in the televised coverage , another taunting line : that of the world , or olympic , record .
this single-minded pursuit is noble , admirable , even fanatic - and it is enough to bring even a spectator to tears .
but it is also what i find slightly exhausting about even watching the games .
from this , trampoline offers a respite .
the trampoliner &apos;s vector is up .
forward motion is not the goal .
he or she rebounds , seeming weightless as an astronaut , going up , then down , then effortlessly up again .
it is not without competition , of course , nor without difficulty , but for the duration of a routine , there is no frantic charge toward the end , no vaulting into the distance , just the dreamy , graceful suspension of time and gravity .
it is as close to zen as olympic competition gets .
the women &apos;s qualifiers and then finals will take place on friday afternoon , streaming at 1 p.m. eastern time ; the men &apos;s on saturday , also at 1 .
nbc will air the finals as part of an afternoon block beginning at 2 p.m. on both days .
in the midst of olympic mania , they promise a quiet , lovely moment , one likely to be overlooked in the general melee .
and if consciousness raising is to be achieved only by offering up male athletes for ogling and objectification - as the united states men &apos;s gymnasts recently proposed , according to the wall street journal - mr. dooley only awaits his gasping new fan base .
&quot; a generation is protesting &quot; in ethiopia , long a u.s. ally
violent protests in ethiopia
demonstrators demanding political change in ethiopia have been met with violent resistance by the government .
witnesses say that scores of protesters have been fatally shot during clashes with police .
is ethiopia about to crack ?
for the last decade , it has been one africa &apos;s most stable nations , a solid western ally with a fast-growing economy .
but in recent months , anti-government protests have convulsed the country , spreading into more and more areas .
in the last week alone , thousands of people stormed into the streets , demanding fundamental political change .
the government response , according to human rights groups , was ruthless .
witnesses said that police officers shot and killed scores of unarmed demonstrators .
videos circulating from protests thought to be from late last year or earlier this year show security officers whipping young people with sticks as they were forced to perform handstands against a wall .
the top united nations human rights official is now calling for a thorough investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult holding this country together , and moving forward , it will be even harder , &quot; said rashid abdi , the horn of africa project director for the international crisis group , a research group .
ethiopia is the second most populous nation in africa , after nigeria , and its stability is cherished by the west .
american military and intelligence services work closely with the ethiopians to combat terrorist threats across the region , especially in somalia , and few if any countries in africa receive as much western aid .
ethiopia &apos;s economy has been expanding at an impressive clip .
its infrastructure has improved drastically - there is even a new commuter train in the capital , addis ababa .
and its streets are typically quiet , safe and clean .
though ethiopia has hardly been a paragon of democracy - human rights groups have constantly cited the government &apos;s repressiveness - opposition within the country had been limited , with dissidents effectively silenced .
many have been exiled , jailed , killed or driven to the far reaches of the desert .
but that may be changing .
&quot; if you suffocate people and they don &apos;t have any other options but to protest , it breaks out , &quot; said seyoum teshome , a university lecturer in central ethiopia .
the whole youth is protesting .
a generation is protesting .
the complaints are many , covering everything from land use to the governing coalition &apos;s stranglehold on power .
after a widely criticized election last year , the governing party and its allies got the last seat the opposition had held and now control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time , tensions are rising along the border with eritrea ; a battle along that jagged , disputed line claimed hundreds of lives in june .
analysts fear that separatist groups that had been more or less vanquished in recent years , like the oromo liberation front or the ogaden national liberation front , may try to exploit the turbulence and rearm .
several factors explain why bitter feelings , after years of simmering beneath the surface , are exploding now .
the first is seemingly innocuous : smartphones .
only in the last couple of years have large numbers of ethiopians been able to communicate using social media as cheaper smartphones became common and internet service improved .
even when the government shuts down access to facebook and twitter , as it frequently does , especially during protests , many people are still able to communicate via internet proxies that mask where they are .
several young ethiopians said this was how they gathered for protests .
second , there is more solidarity between oromos and amharas , ethiopia &apos;s two largest ethnic groups .
oromos and amharas are not natural allies .
for eons , amharas from ethiopia &apos;s predominantly christian highlands flourished in politics and business , exploiting the oromos , many of whom are muslim and live in lowland areas .
but that is changing as well .
&quot; we are on the way to coordinate under one umbrella , &quot; said mulatu gemechu , an oromo leader .
the biggest protests have been in amhara and oromo areas .
many amharas and oromos feel ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the tigrayan ethnic group , which makes up about 6 percent of the population and dominates the military , the intelligence services , commerce and politics .
the third reason behind the unrest is the loss of meles zenawi .
mr. meles , a former rebel leader , was ethiopia &apos;s prime minister for 17 years , until his death from an undisclosed illness in 2012 .
he was considered a tactical genius , a man who could see around corners .
analysts say he was especially adept at detecting early signals of discontent and using emissaries to massage and defang opponents .
&quot; the current regime lacks that ground savvy , &quot; mr. abdi , the conflict analyst , said .
ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , hailemariam desalegn , was plucked from relative obscurity to fill mr. meles &apos;s shoes .
unlike mr. meles , who came from the tigray region of northern ethiopia , mr. hailemariam is a southerner .
analysts say he does not have the trust of the tigrayan-controlled security services .
the result , many fear , is more bloodshed .
the last time ethiopia experienced such turmoil was in 2005 , after thousands protested over what analysts have said appeared to be an election the government bungled and then stole .
in the ensuing crackdown , many protesters were killed , though fewer than in recent months , and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly .
development experts have praised ethiopia &apos;s leaders for visionary infrastructure planning , such as the new commuter train , and measurable strides in fighting poverty .
but clearly that has not stopped the internal resentment of ethiopia &apos;s government from intensifying .
and it is taking a dangerous ethnic shape .
last month , protesters in gondar , an amhara town , attacked businesses owned by tigrayans , and anti-tigrayan hatred is becoming more common in social media .
analysts say the protests are putting the united states and other western allies in an awkward position .
the american government has used ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring somalia , though it recently said it closed that base .
while the west clearly wants to support democracy , it also does not want its ally in an already volatile region to crumble .
&quot; that , &quot; mr. abdi said , &quot; is a very tight rope to walk . &quot;
donald trump explains his obama-founded-isis claim as &quot; sarcasm &quot;
donald j. trump tried to quash the latest controversy engulfing his campaign on friday by claiming that he was not serious when he insisted several times this week that president obama and hillary clinton were the &quot; founders &quot; of the islamic state terrorist group .
the clarification raised new questions about the republican presidential nominee &apos;s ability to communicate clearly to the american public .
it also put his surrogates , who have strained to defend him during a tumultuous stretch , in the awkward position of having to explain remarks that he might not mean .
after making the suggestion at a rally on wednesday night , mr. trump doubled down on the assertion on thursday , insisting in interviews that he really did intend to say that the president and mrs. clinton had created isis .
but in an early-morning twitter post on friday , mr. trump said that he was just being sarcastic .
the post was a reversal from just a day ago , when mr. trump said in a number of interviews that he was indeed serious about the charge .
when the conservative radio host hugh hewitt tried to help mr. trump soften the remark by reminding him that mr. obama wants to destroy isis , the republican presidential nominee would not have it .
the latest firestorm comes as mr. trump has been trying to refocus his campaign on the economy amid declining poll numbers .
mr. trump and mrs. clinton gave dueling economic speeches in michigan this week .
on friday , mr. trump tried again to return to that subject .
taking again to twitter , he warned that mrs. clinton &apos;s proposals would come with higher taxes and he said that he found her speech boring .
mr. trump has used the sarcasm defense before .
in late july , after he drew widespread criticism by appearing to suggest that the russians should hack mrs. clinton &apos;s emails , he later explained his remarks by saying , &quot; of course i &apos;m being sarcastic . &quot;
the approach allows mr. trump to push the limits of political speech and dial it back as needed .
&quot; i think it &apos;s a pattern of him testing certain messages that resonate with his fans , seeing how they play , and then &quot; clarifying &quot; one way or another depending on the reaction , &quot; said ruth sherman , a communications expert who has been monitoring the language used by both candidates .
but i also think he &apos;s clever about his statements and knows they are vague enough to be filtered through various lenses .
instead of toning things down for a general election audience , mr. trump has taken an even more caustic tone in recent days as his poll numbers have continued to tumble .
a new nbc / wall street journal / marist poll released on friday showed mr. trump trailing mrs. clinton by large margins in north carolina , virginia and colorado and locked in a tight race in florida .
while mr. trump generally tries to avoid apologizing for provocative things that he says , he often accuses his critics of misconstruing his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor .
but as he faces heightened scrutiny during the final months of the presidential campaign , mr. trump &apos;s jokes have put his loyal allies in the uncomfortable position of having to publicly stand up for him no matter how provocative his remarks .
rudolph w. giuliani , the former new york city mayor who is one of mr. trump &apos;s most prominent surrogates , went to great lengths to defend the candidate in an interview with cnn on thursday .
&quot; i think what he &apos;s saying there is legitimate , political commentary , &quot; mr. giuliani said when questioned about the veracity of mr. trump &apos;s assertion about mr. obama and mrs. clinton having founded the islamic state .
it is true in a sense that before obama , isis was an almost unknown , small little organization , he who called it the jayvee , totally wrong , and here &apos;s why it happened , because he withdrew the troops from iraq .
most mainstream republicans try to argue that the obama administration , in which mrs. clinton served as secretary of state , allowed isis to fester by failing to aggressively manage the situation in the middle east .
ahead of rallies in pennsylvania on friday , mr. trump continued to lash out on twitter at the news media for harping on his every word and for being biased against him .
he mocked the &quot; poor , pathetic &quot; television pundits who try to figure him out and said , &quot; they can &apos;t ! &quot;
some democrats scoffed at mr. trump &apos;s excuse as more evidence that he is unfit to be president .
once priced out , a cafe returns in greenpoint
verb cafe was a shabby , cash-only space in williamsburg that had no wi-fi but served good coffee for 15 years .
naturally , it got priced out of its bedford avenue storefront .
the store that replaced the verb in the summer of 2014 , soap cherie , sells soaps in the shape of cupcakes .
locals bemoaned it as the latest loss in a gentrifying city .
the artist molly crabapple wrote on twitter , &quot; new york is change , i know , but still , can &apos;t believe cbgb &apos;s is dead and the chelsea hotel is gutted and verb is now a soap shop . &quot;
but if new york is change , it is also reinvention .
a revived verb cafe opened last november in greenpoint , less than a mile north of the original location .
the new verb has wi-fi and accepts credit cards but has some of the same employees and a similar unpretentious vibe .
the coffee is still good , too .
leading the new verb is cisco rodriguez , a longtime employee at the old cafe who is an owner and the general manager at the new place .
he started at verb in 2001 and was there until the end .
when a customer offered to bankroll him in a new outpost , he said he was excited to do it .
mr. rodriguez , 36 , kept a lot of things the same .
verb uses the same distributor for the bagels and bought the same model of espresso machine .
it even reused the lights from the old verb .
but mr. rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
bacon-egg-and-cheese sandwiches are on the menu , and toppings like capers and sautéed onions are available .
there are brown-rice bowls .
the cafe no longer serves beer but now makes fresh juices .
nine months in , mr. rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regulars .
&quot; a lot of former customers got priced out of williamsburg too , &quot; he said .
on a recent sunday , rebecca oliveira was one such customer .
ms. oliveira , 34 , used to live in williamsburg and went to verb frequently .
even after she moved to greenpoint , she would still make the trek .
after verb closed , she said , she gave up drinking coffee for a while .
&quot; i realized it was the coffee and the culture at verb that i liked , &quot; she said .
now she &apos;s back on coffee , although that day , instead of her usual iced coffee , she went with a blended chai drink , another new addition .
tom rosenthal , another longtime customer , went faithfully to verb starting in 2003 .
he &apos;d go before work and order the same thing without fail .
&quot; quarter past seven , every day , like clockwork , i &apos;d come in and they were making my everything bagel with butter , &quot; he said .
photo mr. rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and introduced new ingredients to the menu .
these days , mr. rosenthal still gets his regular order , but sometimes he &apos;ll switch things up with the bacon , egg and cheese on an everything bagel .
mr. rodriguez said he had no hard feelings about the soap shop taking over the old space .
in fact , the soap cherie owners offered to make special soap for verb , using the cafe &apos;s cold-brewed coffee as an ingredient .
&quot; i think we still might take them up on it , &quot; mr. rodriguez said .
and greenpoint &apos;s traditional polish residents have embraced the cafe as well .
one of these new customers translated the menu into polish , and mr. rodriguez said he planned to find a spot to display it soon to make his new neighbors feel welcome .
the new location has other perks .
a local juice spot wants to bottle and sell the cold-brewed coffee .
there is a chance the cafe will expand into an adjacent building .
for many customers , a new verb to get their old favorites is enough .
joseph whitt was a regular and said he was heartbroken when they closed .
when the new space opened , mr. whitt said , walking in and getting a coffee felt like a homecoming .
&quot; i &apos;ve needed to smell that , &quot; he said .
the depressing food of the depression , in &quot; a square meal &quot;
in march 1933 , shortly after ascending to the presidency , franklin delano roosevelt sat down to lunch in the oval office .
a gourmand , president roosevelt had a taste for fancy fifth avenue foods like pâté de foie gras and maryland terrapin soup .
his menu that day was more humble : deviled eggs in tomato sauce , mashed potatoes and , for dessert , prune pudding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who were suffering , &quot; jane ziegelman said .
her husband , andrew coe , added , &quot; it was also a message to americans about how to eat . &quot;
the couple , who live in brooklyn heights , are food historians .
mr. coe &apos;s last book , &quot; chop suey , &quot; was about chinese cuisine in america , while ms. ziegelman told the story of life in a lower east side tenement through food in her book &quot; 97 orchard . &quot;
their new , collaborative work , &quot; a square meal , &quot; which will be published tuesday by harper , is a history of american food in the great depression .
showing some culinary solidarity of their own , they met a reporter for dinner at eisenberg &apos;s sandwich shop , a tiny no-frills lunch counter in the flatiron district that has been in business since the year of the crash , 1929 .
ms. ziegelman , 54 , ordered a cream cheese and chopped olive sandwich , while mr. coe , 57 , had the turkey , mashed potatoes and vegetable medley .
when a reporter ordered meatloaf , the couple deemed it fitting for a discussion of depression-era eating .
&quot; loaves were very popular , &quot; ms. ziegelman said .
there was peanut loaf , liver loaf , bean loaf .
they were made from an ingredient and a cheap thing that stretches the ingredient out .
imagine eating enough peanuts to serve as your dinner .
mr. coe grimaced .
&quot; it must have sat in your stomach like lead , &quot; he said .
in the years before the depression , the american table , especially in rural areas , was an all-you-can-eat buffet .
teams of women cooked for male farmworkers , and fresh-baked pie was served at breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was americans who had sent food to starving europeans during world war i. &quot; a square meal &quot; chronicles the ways the nation coped with suddenly not being the land of plenty .
&quot; this was a time when food became a central , fraught subject for the american people , &quot; mr. coe said , explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it .
equally fraught was the new budget diet : mystery dishes like loaves and casseroles became staples , the casserole a &quot; wonderful way to repurpose leftovers , &quot; ms. ziegelman noted , because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy coating of sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit .
meat , for years the center of the american meal , became a sparingly apportioned luxury .
strange mashups were tried as caloric and nutritional fulfillment took precedent over taste or even common kitchen sense .
in researching the book , which includes recipes , ms. ziegelman prepared a period dish of baked onion stuffed with peanut butter .
&quot; it was not a popular addition to the dinner table , &quot; mr. coe said .
ms. ziegelman amplified : &quot; it was surreal . &quot;
peanut butter has nothing to say to a baked onion .
it was characteristic of a lot of the home-ec recipes .
as never before or since , home economists - among them louise stanley , chief of the federal bureau of home economics from 1923 to 1943 - drove the country &apos;s eating habits .
publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; budgeteers &quot; and rise to the challenge of transforming glop like creamed spaghetti with carrots into tasty dishes .
&quot; a square meal &quot; is a feast of historical tidbits .
especially savory are the accounts of the government &apos;s response to its hungry citizenry , like president herbert hoover &apos;s let-me-eat-cake attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple iowa farmhouse cooking of his childhood , he dined like the millionaire sophisticate he had become .
&quot; he liked to eat continental cuisine , like fish with cucumber sauce , &quot; mr. coe said .
he ate in almost a gold-plated dining room , wearing a dinner jacket .
he was fabulously out of touch .
president roosevelt may have committed the same error if his wife , eleanor , had not encouraged him to set an example with his stomach .
as the book tells it , mrs. roosevelt &apos;s hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in flavor resulted in a white house that &quot; put out not only some of the dreariest food in washington but also some of the most dismally prepared . &quot;
many of the depression-era food ways were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet .
the legacy is in our continued focus on calories and nutrition , ms. ziegelman said , and on the way science has been applied to cooking .
the couple said that in writing the book , they gained greater understanding of the eating habits of ms. ziegelman &apos;s mother - how she couldn &apos;t throw food away , for instance .
&quot; she had a real fear of food waste , &quot; mr. coe said .
ms. ziegelman recalled : &quot; she actually got people sick . &quot;
there was the cream-puff incident .
after the plates were cleared at eisenberg &apos;s , she and mr. coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home : the prune dessert that president roosevelt ate for lunch .
&quot; it &apos;s called prune whip , &quot; ms. ziegelman said , adding that a common trick was to give modest recipes a snazzy name .
there was no whipped cream , just prunes , a little bit of flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone reluctantly dipped a spoon into the viscous brown goo .
surprisingly , it wasn &apos;t bad .
mr. coe went back for seconds , and thirds .
sounding like a can-do budgeter , he told his wife , &quot; some chopped walnuts would help . &quot;
gilead to get attorney fees in hepatitis c patent fight with merck
gilead sciences inc is entitled to receive the attorney fees it incurred related to hepatitis c patent litigation with drugmaker merck &amp; co inc , a u.s. district judge has ruled .
in june , gilead was freed from paying up $ 200 million in damages for infringing two merck patents related to gilead &apos;s blockbuster drugs sovaldi and harvoni , after a u.s. judge found a pattern of misconduct by merck including lying under oath and other unethical practices .
in a filing on thursday , u.s. district judge beth labson freeman said that gilead was entitled to relief from the fees it incurred while defending the case .
merck is trying to catch up to gilead , which dominates the market on a new generation of hepatitis c drugs that can cure well over 90 percent of patients with the liver disease .
the case dates back to 2013 when gilead and merck sued each other , claiming ownership of laboratory work underlying sofosbuvir , the active ingredient in gilead &apos;s drugs .
u.s. backed forces say they have seized full control of manbij from islamic state
u.s.-backed forces have seized full control of northern city of manbij near the turkish border after the last remaining islamic state fighters inside the city left , a spokesman for the group said on friday .
syria democratic forces ( sdf ) were now sweeping the city after the departure of a remaining group of militants who had been holed up in the city .
they had freed over 2,000 civilian hostages who had been held by the militants , sharfan darwish of the sdf allied manbij military council told reuters .
&quot; the city is now fully under our control but we are undertaking sweeping operations , &quot; he told reuters .
clintons earned $ 10.75 million in 2015 , paid 34.2 percent federal tax rate
hillary clinton on friday released her 2015 tax returns , which showed the democratic presidential nominee and her husband had $ 10.75 million in income that year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent .
in 2015 , the clintons made $ 1 million in charitable contributions , mostly to the clinton foundation ; former president bill clinton brought in nearly $ 5.3 million in speaking fees ; and the former secretary of state reported income of $ 3 million from publisher simon &amp; schuster for her book on her tenure at the state department .
clinton &apos;s running mate , u.s. senator tim kaine of virginia , along with his wife , anne holton , released 10 years of tax returns .
they paid a federal effective tax rate of 20.3 percent in 2015 .
&quot; hillary clinton and tim kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency , &quot; clinton campaign aide jennifer palmieri said in a statement .
in stark contrast , donald trump is hiding behind fake excuses and backtracking on his previous promises to release his tax returns .
it is customary for u.s. presidential candidates to make their tax returns public , although they are not required by law to do so .
trump , a new york businessman , and his lawyers have cited an audit by the internal revenue service as a reason for his refusal to release his returns .
&quot; your move , &quot; clinton campaign aide ian sams said on twitter , linking to the democratic nominee &apos;s returns .
on thursday , trump &apos;s special counsel , michael cohen , told cnn he would not allow trump to release them until the audits are complete .
trump &apos;s critics , including 2012 republican presidential candidate mitt romney and other fellow republicans , have said his refusal raises questions about his net worth , his charitable contributions , his business dealings and various other ties , including with russia .
clinton has pounced on the issue , releasing an online video on friday highlighting high-profile republicans urging trump to release his taxes .
on thursday , she raised the issue during an economic speech in michigan .
&quot; he refuses to do what every other presidential candidate in decades has done and release his tax returns , &quot; she told the crowd .
politico has reported that trump paid zero to very little taxes for two years in the 1990s , and a new york times business columnist on friday quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants saying that could still be the case .
federal tax rates have become an issue in the presidential election .
clinton has endorsed a rule named after billionaire investor warren buffett that would ensure those making more than $ 1 million a year pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent .
president barack obama also backs the proposal .
at a clinton rally last week in omaha , nebraska , buffett , whose berkshire hathaway conglomerate is based there , challenged trump to meet and exchange tax returns .
buffet said that he too was under irs audit and trump is &quot; afraid &quot; not of the tax-collection agency but of voters .
clinton &apos;s campaign has released tax returns going back to 2007 .
the clintons , who now live in chappaqua , new york , paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40.5 percent .
the clintons &apos; 2015 return showed that , unlike most americans , just $ 100 of their income came from wages .
their main investment was a low-cost index mutual fund , and the clintons reported dividend and interest income of $ 109,000 .

chilli-powder condoms , firecrackers boost tanzania elephant protection
conservationists in tanzania are using an unorthodox way of keeping elephants from wandering into human settlements - by throwing condoms filled with chilli powder at them .
the method has proved effective and honeyguide foundation , which hit upon the idea several years ago , with u.s.-based nature conservancy has stepped up its promotion , training volunteers in villages in north tanzania to use a non-violent four-step way of protecting their homes and crops without hurting the animals .
previously many used spears to defend themselves .
friday is world elephant day , which is dedicated to the protection of the animals .
&quot; since we developed the ... toolkit , we have seen an attitude change within these communities whereby they are much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming the elephants , &quot; honeyguide executive director damian bell said in a statement .
the first two steps involve shining a torch at the trespassing elephant and sounding a horn .
if it is not deterred , a so-called &quot; chilli cloud &quot; is thrown .
chilli powder mixed with soil is packed with a firecracker into a condom , its end is twisted shut with just the fuse exposed .
when lit , the condom bursts open with a bang , spraying a fine dust of chilli powder into the air .
one whiff is usually enough to send an elephant the other way .
a last resort is a launcher that shoots a roman candle firework into the air , producing a loud , bright explosion .
jewish filmmaker slams berlin hotel for removing israel dial code after arab &quot; request &quot; - rt news
a french filmmaker of jewish origin unleashed a media furor after he revealed that the kempinski bristol hotel in berlin does not list israel &apos;s dial code , with employee citing &quot; requests &quot; from arabic customers .
claude lanzmann , an author of holocaust documentary &quot; shoah , &quot; vented his frustration at the kempinski bristol hotel in berlin , writing an open letter in the german outlet faz .
during his recent stay , lanzmann tried to find israel in the list of dial codes provided by the hotel .
the country however was not mentioned among the states one can call directly from the room .
how is it possible , in 2016 in berlin , the capital of the new germany , that israel was eliminated and eradicated ?
lanzmann wrote .
instead , kempinski bristol offers an opportunity to dial israel via an own call center .
seeking explanation , the filmmaker addressed the issue at the hotel &apos;s reception .
the answer he got there , lanzmann wrote &quot; shocked him . &quot;
the hotel &apos;s clerk said that the measure was &quot; a deliberate decision by the management of kempinski-hotels . &quot;
the reason behind the move triggered even more outrage by the filmmaker .
&quot; the majority of our guests are arabs and they demanded israel &apos;s code to be deleted , &quot; the employee was quoted as saying by lanzmann .
israeli ambassador to germany yakov hadas-handelsman called the case a &quot; great shame , &quot; suddeutsche zeitung reports .
we were appalled and shocked by the incident .
it is in itself a great shame .
the fact that it has occurred in germany and at that very hotel chain , is an even greater disgrace .
that needs no explanation .
we expect that the hotel draws the right conclusions , &quot; the official said .
the incident triggered quite a response online , with people calling it a scandal .
some alleged that the kempinski hotel simply &quot; caved in &quot; to the alleged demands of arabic customers .
&quot; shame on you , &quot; another post stated , pointing out that the hotel , located in the noble kurfurstendamm street stands near a synagogue .
the hotel itself was quick to brush off any accusations , calling what happened an &quot; oversight &quot; and &quot; apologizing &quot; to lanzmann , der spiegel reports .
&quot; there was never a direct order &quot; not to include israel in the fast dial list , &quot; suddeutsche zeitung quoted a kempinski representative as saying .
it adds that the code was now added .
police use tear gas &amp; rubber bullets against protesting brazilian students
students clashed with police in the brazilian city of sao paulo on thursday as they gathered to demonstrate against government reforms to the public education system .
police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters .
the trouble started when law enforcement officers tried to disperse the students , which led to the police using rubber bullets and tear gas .
several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their dismay at the plans .
under proposals from the governor of the state of sao paulo geraldo alckmin , just under 100 public schools will be closed , while 300,000 students will be relocated in order to save money .
some of those taking part in the protest could be seen writing graffiti on the walls against the interim president michel temer .
this latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets en masse to support suspended president dilma rousseff as the country &apos;s senate voted for her impeachment .
trade between russia &amp; iran surges 71 % - rt business
with the lifting of sanctions , trade turnover between moscow and tehran has grown 70.9 percent in year-on-year terms , according to russia &apos;s ambassador to iran , levan dzhagaryan .
since international sanctions against iran were lifted , there has been a surge in interest from russian firms in doing business in the country , the ambassador said .
russian companies are resuming existing ties with iran , while new firms are ready to get access to the market .
of course , the further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of the bilateral cooperation with iran , &quot; dzhagaryan said .
he noted that in the first five months of 2016 the trade turnover between russia and iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period of 2015 and amounted to $ 856 million .
in particular , russian exports to iran jumped by 91.5 percent and amounted to $ 697 million .
russian imports from iran increased by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the boost in trade was achieved by supplies of machinery , ground vehicles and weapons , &quot; the ambassador said .
dzhagaryan is also expecting a record number of iranian tourists to visit russia this year .
last year , the russian diplomatic mission in iran issued about 35,000 visas , mostly travel , to iranian citizens .
in addition , for the first time iran entered the top 20 countries by number of tourists visiting russia .
it &apos;s safe to say that last year &apos;s record number of iranian tourists visiting russia will be broken , &quot; he said .
at the same time , relatively few russians are visiting iran , something the ambassador hopes will change .
&quot; i can personally recommend to visit the cities of isfahan , shiraz and yazd that have preserved monuments of ancient persian civilization in good condition , &quot; he said .
scot callum skinner storms home as brits grab cycling gold
scotland &apos;s callum skinner raced to glory in the men &apos;s team sprint at the rio velodrome last night as the team gb trio defended the title from london 2012 .
the glaswegian 23-year-old was in the anchor role that his fellow scotsman sir chris hoy made his own and the youngster did the legend proud as he stormed home to snatch victory from the favoured new zealand outfit .
britain claimed a shock victory four years ago to win as hoy claimed the fifth of his six olympic golds .
and they repeated the trick after finishing a lowly sixth at march &apos;s track world championships in london , despite hoy having since retired .
the issue between beijing and london was replacing specialist starter jamie staff .
they did so just in time as hindes emerged .
hoy &apos;s retirement also created a void which kian emadi and matt crampton tried to fill .
skinner was the man britain &apos;s coaches stuck with , seeing potential in the scot which has now been realised .
hindes , kenny - champions with hoy four years ago - and skinner set an olympic record in qualifying , but the standard was overtaken by new zealand in the first round .
and the british trio won the duel for gold .
hindes was narrowly behind after his lap , but kenny pushed the team in front and skinner held on .
a change of strategy was a big part of the transformation , with hindes riding a bigger gear to slow him down and allow kenny and , in particular , skinner to keep pace .
hoy watched on from his position as a bbc pundit and caught the eye of skinner , kenny and hindes when they stepped on to the podium .
the 23-year-old skinner , from glasgow , said : &quot; it &apos;s a flattering comparison . &quot;
i &apos;m just out there to do my best and make a name for myself .
we set an olympic record in the final and beat the world champions .
it was just incredible .
there &apos;s no better way to win it .
after triumphing at london 2012 alongside kenny and hoy , hindes admitted to deliberately falling to the track following a poor start .
he later retracted the comment and there was no method of appeal from britain &apos;s rivals .
there was no such issue this time around in a supreme victory .
hindes said : &quot; it felt like london , with all the gb flags in the stand . &quot;
we all as a team came together in the last three months .
we &apos;ve been losing out on so many world titles , so to win the olympics again is just amazing .
that is one event , one gold medal for the nation which won seven out of 10 track titles in both beijing and london .
if that is a barometer of the progress made in the last five months , then a successful five days in the velodrome awaits .
with the form kenny demonstrated , it is not beyond the realms of possibility to imagine him repeating hoy &apos;s feat of winning three olympic golds in one games .
that would see kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than hoy , who is also born on 23 march ( that seemingly sacred date in british sport which is also the birthday of steve redgrave , mo farah and roger bannister ) - take his tally to six gold medals and one silver .
that would be the same as hoy &apos;s .
kenny next competes in the sprint , which begins on today and plays out over three days .
the 28-year-old from bolton said : &quot; i &apos;m just enjoying this one for now .
the team event is always the best .
you get to win it with your mates .
it &apos;s a bit lonely winning on your own to be honest .
hindes said : &quot; if he wins another two gold medals , he should get a knighthood . &quot;
it was the day &apos;s only medal event , but there was further good news for britain .
sir bradley wiggins , ed clancy , steven burke and owain doull qualified fastest in the four-man , four-kilometres team pursuit .
they finished in 3 : 51.943 .
the world record , set in winning gold at london 2012 , is 3 : 51.659 .
the first round and final ( 10.42pm ) take place on today &apos;s second day of action , where wiggins is sure to be the focus .
he had a dispute with commissaires yesterday ahead of the qualification ride , when officials summoned him to measure his height .
in the corresponding women &apos;s event , which resumes and concludes tomorrow , laura trott , joanna rowsell shand , elinor barker and katie archibald of milngavie advanced in a world record time , clocking 4 : 13.260 .
team gb have come to rely on its mighty track cycling squad to take ownership of the middle period of an olympic games and deliver a host of medals .
after truly exceptional showings of utter dominance at beijing and london , expectations have been played down in the lead-up to rio .
there have been dramas in the background , not least the resignation of technical director shane sutton in april amid sexism and bullying allegations , and the retirements of giant figures like hoy and victoria pendleton .
however , on the evidence of the first night &apos;s racing in the velodrome , it looks like gb &apos;s now legendary reputation for peaking at the perfect time could be about to be repeated once again .
portland smelter &apos;s future in doubt with axing of power contract
the future of the portland aluminium smelter in victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is in doubt with the power company which supplies the plant disclosing one of the plant &apos;s owners is to terminate a supply contract , with all supply contracts expected to be axed .
the move follows the decision of the victoria government earlier this year to not extend subsidies provided to keep the plant in operation .
a 20-year fixed subsidy expires in november .
up to 2000 jobs may be at risk at alcoa &apos;s portland plant .
as many as 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk with any closure .
and there could be additional knock-on effects since the smelter consumes around 10 per cent of victoria &apos;s entire electricity output .
in 2014 , alcoa closed the point henry smelter which led to the closure last year of the anglesea power plant .
alcoa &apos;s portland smelter is losing money and risks closure .
the moves follows speculation about the future of the plant for several years now , initially in the wake of the strong australian dollar and more recently due to the price for the output from the plant .
agl , which supplies the big aluminium smelter with electricity from its loy yang a power plant in the latrobe valley , said it expects the other three owners will also move to terminate their agreements .
the plant is majority owned by a joint venture of alcoa and alumina , with china &apos;s citic and japan &apos;s marubeni corp holding smaller shares .
&quot; agl expects the portland facility to continue to operate , meaning physical demand for electricity from the smelter will continue , &quot; it said .
agl said the contracts are so-called &apos; hedging contracts &apos; which were due to take effect from november 2016 .
the contracts have a 12-month termination period so they will actually finish in 2017 .
&quot; as such , agl continues to expect the contracts to contribute to earnings in fiscal year 17 , &quot; the power company said .
any potential earnings impact on agl from fy18 onwards is currently limited by the strong futures market outlook for wholesale electricity prices .
agl said it had already written down the value of the contracts in its accounts by $ 187 million in &quot; anticipation of a termination event . &quot;
alcoa said the decision to close out the contracts &quot; does not affect alcoa &apos;s ... ability to operate the smelter or secure electricity supply to the smelter . &quot;
the us company said it entered into a 20-year contract with loy yang in 2010 , which was due to commence from november this year , although it has yet to explain why it has pulled out of the contract .
analysts have been wary of the possible closure of both of the portland smelter in victoria and also the tomago plant near newcastle due to the poor economics of the industry .
addressing analysts earlier in the week , agl &apos;s head of operations , stephen mikkelsen said portland uses around 600 megawatts of power annually and tomago around 900 megawatts .
if both of those plants go from the market that &apos;s a significant reduction in demand in the &#91; electricity &#93; market .
and as a generator that wouldn &apos;t be good for us , &quot; he said .
not just a kardashian reality tv star , kendall &apos;s on the cover of september &apos;s vogue
kendall jenner , 20 , model and fourth daughter of mother-manager kris &apos;s kardashian-jenner clan , is on the cover of us vogue &apos;s coveted september issue .
kendall , who is an estee lauder brand ambassador and has walked in milan , paris and new york fashion weeks , announced the news on her instagram account on thursday .
&quot; in a room with a bunch of people i love , looking at this cover made me cry , &quot; kendall wrote .
the cover revelation was followed by a bizarre ( or simply keeping up with the kardashians-esque ? ) , scripted reality video that featured the entire kardashian-jenner family ( bar troublemakers rob and caitlyn , and joined by everyone &apos;s favourite showbiz uncle , keeping up producer ryan seacrest ) forgetting about their sister &apos;s cover , only to end with the classic twist : they were all planning a surprise party .
it &apos;s the cliche plot line of nearly every &quot; birthday &quot; episode of a children &apos;s television show ( seacrest delivers the line , &quot; you thought we forgot about you ? , &quot; with the sincerity of a cartoon rabbit in an 8am timeslot ) , but kris had to get her other girls in on this publicity somehow .
because , with a spot on vogue &apos;s september issue , we have surely entered a new era of kardashian .
kendall &apos;s big sister kim may have beaten her to the cover of vogue ( she shared it with husband kanye west in april 2014 ) , but the magazine &apos;s september cover is a league unto itself .
the september issue is vogue &apos;s highest selling edition of the year .
with a thickness more closely resembling a coffee table book than a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a huge number of advertisers ( fashionista counted 615 of last year &apos;s 832-page tome as advertising content ) .
the revelation of its cover star is so hotly anticipated that , in the past two years , pictures of the magazine have been leaked before the official announcement .
previous women to feature on the cover include naomi campbell , linda evangelista and kate moss .
in recent years , the cover has certainly featured more &quot; celebrities who model &quot; than &quot; models who are celebrities . &quot;
oscar winner and dior ambassador jennifer lawrence was featured in 2013 , the year after lady gaga had the honour .
but , even on the off-chance that ms jenner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakout model &quot; of her generation - falls into the former category , she is in pretty good company .
these celebrities are not relatives of famous people , or reality stars , or kids these days who know how to make a good snapchat video ( although jenner is all of these things ) .
they are legitimately talented women , excelling in the entertainment industry .
beyonce , who appeared on last year &apos;s cover , has had one of the strongest years of her career with the release of lemonade .
of course , not everyone is pleased about jenner &apos;s success .
with her reality television history , jenner &apos;s position within the fashion world was always going to be fraught .
in june , original victoria &apos;s secret model stephanie seymour criticised jenner and her colleague gigi hadid , calling them the &quot; bitches of the moment . &quot;
this sentiment has boiled up again with the news of jenner &apos;s vogue cover appearance .
but dwelling on the discontent seems beside the point .
kendall jenner is on the cover of the september issue of vogue .
she is a supermodel , in the purest sense of the word .
she &apos;s walking for marc jacobs .
she &apos;s selling you estee lauder foundation .
she , and all of her sisters , are selling you pictures of themselves on their respective paywalled apps .
she &apos;s selling pictures of cindy crawford &apos;s daughter she photographed to love magazine .
and , in her downtime , possibly just as a way still to see sister kourtney and her kids , she &apos;s on reality television .
community legal centres turn away 160,000 people a year
more than 160,000 of the nation &apos;s most vulnerable are turned away from community legal centres every year , with the sector bracing itself for the impact further funding cuts will have on already-stretched operations .
in queensland , three out of five people - mostly the elderly , immigrants , vulnerable workers , victims of violence and those without resources to fight unfair evictions and the like - are already turned away while seeking free legal advice and representation .
community legal services , already stretched beyond limits , are bracing for further cuts .
from june next year , those legal centres are slated to lose another 30 per cent of their federal funding .
director of community legal centres queensland james farrell said the latest national association of community legal centres census report found thousands of people were already being turned away each year .
mr farrell said without a reversal of the federal government decision , the situation was only going to get worse .
&quot; queensland &apos;s community legal centres are chronically underfunded , meaning thousands of people are turned away from the vital services they need , &quot; he said .
people leaving violent relationships , people with unmanageable and crippling debts , families going through separation , workers who are unfairly sacked - all of these people have problems with legal dimensions , and this report shows that they &apos;re not able to get the help they need .
the federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from june 2017 , which means thousands more vulnerable queenslanders will be forced to navigate complex legal problems without help .
we call on the attorney-general , and queensland senator george brandis to immediately reverse these funding cuts , so people can get the help they need when they &apos;re faced with a legal problem .
last year , the state government delivered on its commitment to bring legal aid funding up to the national average .
it &apos;s now time to look at the needs of community legal centres and their client communities , and for the palaszczuk government to invest in this important work .
donald trump campaign sued after staffer allegedly pulled a gun
new york : donald trump &apos;s campaign was sued for allegedly doing nothing after being told that the director of its north carolina operations pulled a gun on a staffer as they drove in a jeep in february .
the incident was described in a lawsuit filed on wednesday in state court in charlotte by vincent bordini , a former software trainer for the state campaign .
bordini said he waited for months for the situation to be handled internally before realising &quot; this was not going to happen . &quot;
the director , earl phillip , &quot; produced a pistol , put his right index finger on the trigger , and drove the barrel into vincent &apos;s knee cap , &quot; bordini said in the complaint .
after complaining to local and regional campaign leadership , bordini learned that at least four other people had experience the same thing with phillip , according to the filing .
&quot; guns don &apos;t have to fire to inflict damage , &quot; bordini said in the complaint .
the suit comes just two days after the republican presidential nominee caused a furore when telling a crowd in north carolina that the &quot; second amendment people &quot; -- understood to be gun owners and gun enthusiasts -- could take action if his rival hillary clinton were elected and gets her pick of judges .
trump &apos;s campaign said the media had taken his words out of context and that he wasn &apos;t advocating violence .
bordini &apos;s complaint seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent supervision , and from phillip for assault , battery and infliction of emotional distress .
trump spokeswoman hope hicks didn &apos;t immediately return a message seeking comment .
attempts to reach phillip were unsuccessful .
wccb , a local news affiliate in charlotte , reported phillip recently left the campaign .
a call left at his consulting firm , innovative consulting services , wasn &apos;t immediately returned .
republican presidential candidate donald trump has run a controversial campaign .
the case is bordini v. donald j. trump for president inc . , 16-cs-14300 , general court of justice , superior court division county of mecklenburg ( charlotte ) .
britain must channel the olympic spirit and expand heathrow
heathrow will also deliver regeneration and prosperity not just in our local communities and across london , but across the country .
for me , this was the great attraction of heathrow , just as it was with london 2012 , where we made enormous efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the olympics achieved huge benefits for stratford and the east end .
and , we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and firms close to heathrow .
for our local communities alone we &apos;ll create 10,000 new apprenticeships , 40,000 new jobs and bring an end to youth unemployment around the airport .
just as there were ahead of london 2012 , there will be those that think the challenge of heathrow expansion is too great .
i was told that britain would be never be ready for the games and that we would be embarrassed on the world stage .
the doubters were wrong on 2012 and they will be proved wrong on heathrow .
there are always obstacles to be overcome , but heathrow is answering every question asked of it .
like the olympics , heathrow is an infrastructure project for the many , not just the few .
expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs , £ 211bn in economic growth , leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the uk .
we have a great team at heathrow who have implemented an £ 11bn programme of infrastructure investment on time and on budget , from t5 - voted the world &apos;s best airport terminal five years in a row , to t2 , built in the middle of the world &apos;s busiest two runways .
now they stand ready to deliver a third runway , backed by £ 16 billion of private investment .
the london 2012 games were a great success for the uk and i am confident that heathrow expansion will be too .
it is time for us to channel that olympic spirit and expand heathrow , securing our trading future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that britain can be proud of .
lord paul deighton is chairman of the heathrow board and former commercial secretary to the treasury
adblock plus , facebook in &quot; cat-and-mouse game &quot; over ad blocking
for companies that make money from online advertising , attempts to circumvent ad-blocking software amount to a &quot; cat-and-mouse game , &quot; according to one of the companies that makes that software .
on thursday , just two days after facebook announced it would be blocking ad blockers on its desktop site , adblock plus published a blog post saying that users could update their filters in its program to block ads on the social network once again .
on tuesday , facebook said that its desktop website would change the coding around its ads in order to make it more difficult for ad blockers to detect which parts of a page are ads .
but adblock now says it has gotten around the new codes .
in a blog post , adblock spokesperson ben williams wrote that &quot; this sort of back-and-forth battle between the open source ad-blocking community and circumventers has been going on since ad blocking was invented , &quot; and that it is possible facebook would come up with its own fix soon .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of just how big a concern ad blockers have become for the industry .
globally , roughly 200 million people use ad blockers , according to a study last year from pagefair and adobe ; nearly quadruple the number who used such software in 2013 .
with 1.03 billion daily active users accessing facebook via mobile devices , mobile advertising now accounts for 84 per cent of facebook &apos;s advertising revenue .
the company is going after ad blockers on desktop however , because mobile ad blockers are not effective in facebook &apos;s mobile apps for the social network and instagram , a spokesperson said .
desktop ads still account for enough revenue that facebook judged such a move to be worth the investment .
also on tuesday , facebook said it would be updating its &quot; ad preferences &quot; tool to give people more control over how ads are targeted to them .
on thursday facebook claimed that adblock &apos;s new filters were concerning because they would also block some non-advertising content on the site .
&quot; this isn &apos;t a good experience for people and we plan to address the issue , &quot; a facebook spokesperson said in an e-mailed statement .
ad blockers are a blunt instrument , which is why we &apos;ve instead focused on building tools like ad preferences to put control in people &apos;s hands .
woman run over on swiss motorway in apparent suicide
the victim was lying on the motorway in the middle of the night .
police are appealing for witnesses after a woman was run over by several vehicles on a motorway in the early hours of thursday in an apparent act of suicide .
the incident happened on the a1 near morges in the canton of vaud just after midnight on thursday .
a woman lay down in the dark on the road &quot; in a desperate act &quot; and was hit by several vehicles , vaud police said in a statement .
clearly looking to kill herself , the victim , a swiss woman aged 49 , was hit by several vehicles including a lorry .
she died at the scene .
several of the drivers involved have already been interviewed but some are still unidentified , said police , who are calling for them and anyone else who witnessed the incident to come forward .
a criminal investigation has been opened , a &quot; logical &quot; step in a situation like this , lawyer gilles hofstetter told le tribune de geneve .
however it remains to be seen if any of the drivers involved will face charges .
was it possible to avoid impact ?
that &apos;s what the prosecutor must determine , &quot; said hofstetter .
two other similar cases in the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible .
in each case - both of which involved a person walking on the motorway in the dark - it was judged that motorists cannot expect to come across a pedestrian on the motorway in the middle of the night , said the paper .
last year a police officer was acquitted of causing death by negligence after she hit and killed a man who was lying on the a1 near paynerne one night in august 2014 .
the 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had passed out on the road , the court heard .
the court found that the policewoman -- who was responding to an emergency call -- was driving in a manner that was justified and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; completely exceptional and unpredictable situation , &quot; the judge said .
anyone with information about thursday &apos;s incident near morges should call police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 .
nasa climate model : venus was once habitable
venus was likely once habitable , according to the projections of a new nasa climate model .
scientists at nasa &apos;s goddard institute for space studies developed a model to explore venus &apos; past using tools and algorithms similar to those employed by climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine whether or not venus , with its hot , water-less surface and co2-chocked atmosphere , might have once hosted earth-like conditions .
scientists have previously suggested that venus &apos; slow rotation rate is explained by its thick atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggests venus could have boasted a thin , earth-like atmosphere and still spun slowly .
the model also looked at the topography of early venus .
the planet likely featured more dry regions than earth , but once had enough water and geographical variability to host life and guard against rapid evaporation .
early venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent dimmer .
&quot; in the giss model &apos;s simulation , venus &apos; slow spin exposes its dayside to the sun for almost two months at a time , &quot; giss scientist anthony del genio explained in a news release .
this warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heating .
the result is mean climate temperatures that are actually a few degrees cooler than earth &apos;s today .
the model produced a story of venus similar to the evolution previously hypothesized by planetary scientists .
though likely once habitable , venus was -- over the course of several billion years -- exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light .
its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light .
as its hydrogen escaped , all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deathly greenhouse gas effect -- thus , the venus we know today .
researchers shared the results of their new venus climate model in the journal geophysical research letters .
patrick roy resigns as avalanche coach
patrick roy resigned as coach and vice president of the hockey operations of the colorado avalanche on thursday , citing a lack of a voice within the team &apos;s decision-making process .
colorado executive vice president / general manager joe sakic confirmed the move and noted that the club will begin a search for a new coach immediately .
&quot; for the past three years , i have carried out my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the colorado avalanche with energy , passion and determination , &quot; the 50-year-old roy said in the statement .
i have thought long and hard over the course of the summer about how i might improve this team to give it the depth it needs and bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the vision of the coach and vp-hockey operations needs to be perfectly aligned with that of the organization .
he must also have a say in the decisions that impact the team &apos;s performance .
these conditions are not currently met .
sakic , who hired roy on may 23 , 2013 , thanked roy for his contributions to the team .
&quot; patrick informed me of his decision today , &quot; sakic said .
we appreciate all he has done for our organization and wish him the best of luck in the future .
roy was named the jack adams award winner as the league &apos;s best coach during his rookie season with the avalanche in 2013-14 .
he guided the club to 112 points and a first-place finish in the central division , but colorado was upset by minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and has missed the postseason in each of the last two years .
the avalanche posted a 39-39-4 mark in 2015-16 and fell five points shy of the wild for the second wild-card spot in the western conference .
a hall of fame goaltender , roy won four stanley cups -- two apiece with the montreal canadiens and the avalanche .
north sea oil workers resume talks , suspend strike
labor strikes over pay for north sea oil workers are suspended while all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks , lead negotiators said .
strikes against oilfield services company wood group have been staged sporadically on platforms in the north sea operated by royal dutch shell .
&quot; wood group and the unite and rmt unions can confirm we have agreed to restart the process for resolution of the current dispute , &quot; a joint statement read .
we will hold a number of full-day meetings over the next few weeks , starting early next week , to take a fresh look at the issues .
the labor unions said their recent action , which they said is the first in more than 25 years , was in protest of potential pay cuts of up to 30 percent .
wood group this year cut rates paid to its north sea contractors by about 9 percent because of negative market pressures .
the company &apos;s rate reduction follows a 10 percent decrease for onshore contractors in 2014 .
the company said additional cuts would give the company the room needed to move through the market downturn .
shell , for its part , has trimmed thousands of people from its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations in the wake of its mega-merger with british energy company bg group .
energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices , an economic situation compounded by the british decision in june to leave the european union .
scottish member of parliament dave anderson met with labor leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes to strike the north sea in a generation .
the north sea , he said , is vital for the regional economy .
&quot; in the north sea and right across the country , we need an economy that works for the many and not just the few , &quot; he said in a statement .
less than $ 1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the north sea is expected in 2016 , compared with an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
kepler measures spin rates of stars in pleiades cluster
the latest mission by the kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of spin rates among the stars of the pleiades cluster .
the new data is helping astronomers understand why stars in the cluster spin at varying rates , as well as how rotation periods relate to planet formation .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results to other star clusters , we will learn more about the relationship between a star &apos;s mass , its age , and even the history of its solar system , &quot; luisa rebull , a research scientist at caltech &apos;s infrared processing and analysis center in pasadena , said in a news release .
the pleiades cluster is situated 445 light-years from earth .
many of the stars in the cluster are just now reaching adulthood , having been born roughly 125 million years ago .
they &apos;re spinning as fast as they ever will .
at their peak spin rates , these maturing stars eject large amounts of stellar wind .
as these winds travel across the stars &apos; magnetic fields , they enact a braking effect on the stars .
as a star ages , its spin rate begins to slow down .
kepler measures each star &apos;s spin rate by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable starspots -- like sunspots .
the latest catalog of spin rates suggests more massive stars spin more slowly than less massive stars .
rebull likens the stars to dancers , larger ones pirouetting more slowly than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &apos; ballet &apos; of the pleiades , we see that slow rotators tend to be more massive , whereas the fastest rotators tend to be very light stars , &quot; said rebull .
because the pleiades cluster is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities with spin rates .
&quot; the pleiades star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation going both directions , younger and older , &quot; said rebull .
we still have a lot we want to learn about how , when and why stars slow their spin rates and hang up their &apos; dance shoes , &apos; so to speak .
rebull and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of pleiades spin rates in three new papers , soon to be published in the astronomical journal .
